# PhilLit Roadmap

**Open engineering work only.** Design sketches live in `docs/ideas/`;
`docs/known-issues/` holds only measurement scripts and their data, kept as the
reproduction path for decisions this file says to re-measure. Shipped work is
deleted from this file rather than marked done — the git log is the history. A
decision that is still binding belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or the module that owns
it, never here; an accepted residual belongs in the function it describes, so
that a recurrence is recognized where it would be read.

## Queue

**Re-vendor phillit-service at `333127c` (the `find_cites` search-rule switch), from a session
launched in that repo.** Push first: the service pins only pushed commits, which is why its
2026-09-04 run (#12) stopped at `2110dc8`. The service's roadmap already records what that run
must do — its `TestProseSurnameIsTheOwner` goes red on the `check_evidence` side by design; port
`tests/test_bib_identity.py::TestProseSurnameIsTheOwner::test_each_site_is_an_alias_of_its_owner`
and the new tests in `tests/test_check_evidence.py`. `enrich_bibliography.py` is untouched by
`333127c`, so its `source-caching` unit is unaffected.

## Checked and deliberately NOT filed

Not a queue — a register, so these are not re-found. Each was a live candidate
that did not survive reading the file it concerns.

- The budget's `Stage 5.5 enrichment | 1 (2 if you added entries after it)`
  does NOT contradict "the bib file is FROZEN after enrichment" — FROZEN's own
  bullet sanctions "adding a missed entry" by surgical `Edit`. Two independent
  reviewers called it a contradiction, which is a readability datum rather than
  a defect, and worth knowing given the audience is a model.
- Stage 4 case 3's `<status from the Stage 3 tail>` is not undefined when a
  source fails: Stage 3's tail names each expected file explicitly, so a
  missing one prints a `grep: … No such file` line. (Stage 1 and Stage 4's
  tails glob, which is the case that IS absent — but neither is quoted by
  case 3.)
- Stage 5.5 does carry a failure path: "a FAILED run — network error, crash —
  does not count: re-run it".
- The validator's required-field exemption (the DOI-retaining `@article` the
  cleaner deliberately keeps) emits nothing when it fires, so no hook-side
  incidence counter sees it; the service logs `required-fields exemption
  applied` from its SubagentStop hook. Not mirrored: the exempted entry
  already carries `METADATA_CLEANED: journal` in its keywords and the strip
  is in the cleaning ledger, so the delivered bib IS the incidence record —
  grep the marker, not the hook.
- The budget's `Stage 5 verification | 1 per ~6 DOIs` is keyed on DOIs while
  Stage 5's work is keyed on papers, so the DOI-less fallback's calls are
  uncounted — real, but the table is explicitly approximate ("About ten
  calls") and says what it caps ("ceremony"), so it does not carry the risk of
  a skipped mandated call.
