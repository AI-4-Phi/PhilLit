## Key Findings by Domain

**Domain 1**: Dustmann et al. 2022 shows housing expenditure amplifies income inequality by 3x (22pp→62pp). 12% of German population overburdened (>40% of income) vs. EU average 8.2%. Residual income approach identifies 62% burdened vs. 48% by ratio approach.

**Domain 2**: IMF 2015 documents Hartz IV reduced real wages ~4%. Wage stagnation 2000-2015. Public sector wages showed varied trends, recent catching up 2022-2024. Collective bargaining coverage declined 14-18pp in private sector but remained strong in public sector.

**Domain 3**: Palier & Thelen 2010 establish dualization explicitly underwritten by state policy in Germany/France. Continental European regimes perpetuate insider-outsider divide. Lennartz & Helbrecht 2020 link labor market dualization to housing market outcomes.

**Domain 4**: Rents in German A-cities increased 70% (2011-2024). Mietpreisbremse showed limited effectiveness (-5% initial, vanished after 1 year). Berlin: 15% experienced displacement, 40,000 new residents/year but only 15,000 new dwellings.

**Domain 5**: Stone 2006 shows measurement choice matters: residual income identifies 62% burdened vs. 48% by 30% ratio. Subjective and objective burden imperfectly overlap. Measurement operationalization is normatively charged.

**Domain 6**: Social housing declined from 4 million (1980s) to 1 million today. Wohngeld effective for recipients (€370/month average) but limited reach (550k-1.1m households). Rent control limited effectiveness suggests structural factors dominant.

## Current Task

**Phase 3 COMPLETE**. Ready for user approval before proceeding to Phase 4: Synthesis Planning.

## Next Steps

1. **AWAIT USER APPROVAL** to proceed to Phase 4
2. Phase 4: Synthesis Planning (design tight 3000-4000 word outline, select 15-25 papers to cite)
3. Phase 5: Synthesis Writing (section-by-section, then assemble)
4. Final output: Focused literature review (3000-4000 words)

## Notes

- User specified 6 specific hypotheses to investigate
- Studies must have housing costs/burden as outcome variable
- Extracted: geography, time period, control variables, quantified findings mapped to hypotheses
- Emphasis on quantitative empirical evidence
- **Execution mode: Human-in-the-Loop (STOPPING NOW FOR USER APPROVAL before Phase 4)**
- Geographic focus: Germany (primary), Europe (secondary)
- Target final output: 3000-4000 words, 15-25 papers cited
- **Phase 3: 100% verification rate - all 68 papers validated**
- All BibTeX files ready for Zotero import (no unverified entries removed)
