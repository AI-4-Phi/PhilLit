====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Distributive justice concerns how benefits and burdens should be allocated
among members of society. The mainstream tradition from Rawls to Sen focuses
on abstract principles and fungible goods (primary goods, resources, capabilities).
However, spatially-embedded goods—housing, neighborhood amenities, access to
public services—pose distinctive challenges. These goods are non-fungible
(location matters), positional (relative standing matters), and relational
(connected to community and identity). Three key debates structure this domain:
(1) whether spatial distribution is derivative of general distributive principles
or requires independent analysis; (2) how positional and located goods affect
traditional equality principles; (3) whether relational approaches (Anderson,
Young) better capture spatial justice than resourcist frameworks (Rawls, Dworkin).

Recent work (2010-2025) has increasingly recognized that "spatial justice" is
not merely applied ethics but raises foundational questions about what goods
we distribute, to whom, and according to what principles. Key developments
include: the emergence of spatial justice as a distinct field (Soja 2010),
capabilities-based approaches to housing and place (Basta 2016, Dummer 2025),
and critiques of standard distributive frameworks for ignoring geography
(Shelby 2016, Dawkins 2021). The field bridges political philosophy, urban
planning, geography, and critical theory.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential theoretical frameworks for analyzing housing
justice and temporal claims. The distinction between fungible and located goods
is central to understanding why housing allocation differs from income
redistribution. Walzer's spheres of justice and Anderson's relational equality
offer alternatives to Rawlsian distributive frameworks that may better capture
the non-fungible, community-embedded nature of housing. Recent work on spatial
justice (Moroni 2020, Israel & Frenkel 2018) connects geographic distribution
to broader questions of equality of opportunity. The capabilities approach
(Sen, Nussbaum, Basta) provides tools for operationalizing housing justice
beyond simple resource allocation.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen substantial work connecting distributive justice to
spatial considerations. Key trends: (1) operationalization of spatial justice
in planning practice (2024); (2) housing-specific justice frameworks combining
capabilities and relational equality (Dummer 2025, Dawkins 2021); (3) critiques
of urban segregation as systemic injustice (Shelby 2016); (4) recognition that
geography itself produces inequality requiring normative analysis (Israel &
Frenkel 2018, Stilz 2019). The field has moved beyond viewing spatial justice
as merely applied distributive justice to recognizing place-based concerns as
raising distinctive philosophical questions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical work explicitly theorizes the non-fungibility of located
goods and its implications for distributive principles. Few papers bridge
analytic political philosophy and critical geography traditions. Temporal
dimensions of housing claims (historical injustice, displacement, gentrification)
remain under-theorized in mainstream distributive justice. The relationship
between positional goods theory and spatial justice needs development. More
work needed on allocation mechanisms for scarce spatial resources beyond market
or bureaucratic distribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For synthesis, prioritize: (1) Foundational contrast between Rawlsian primary
goods and spatially-embedded goods (Rawls 1971, Walzer 1983, Basta 2016);
(2) Relational vs. distributive equality frameworks (Anderson 1999, Young 1990,
Scheffler 2003) as alternatives for spatial justice; (3) Recent work explicitly
on spatial/housing justice (Shelby 2016, Dawkins 2021, Dummer 2025, Moroni
2020, Soja 2010); (4) Positional goods and allocation mechanisms (Hirsch 1976,
Elster 1992). Key tension: Can standard distributive frameworks accommodate
located goods, or do we need distinctive "spatial justice" principles?

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1971},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops justice as fairness with two principles: equal basic liberties and the difference principle allowing inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. Defines primary goods as all-purpose means (rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, self-respect) that any rational person wants regardless of life plan. Argues justice concerns the basic structure of society and fair distribution of these primary goods. RELEVANCE: Foundational framework for distributive justice but treats goods as fungible and location-neutral. The primary goods approach struggles with spatially-embedded goods like housing where location fundamentally affects value and cannot be redistributed like income. Our project examines whether Rawlsian framework can accommodate non-fungible, place-based goods or requires modification.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Rejects single universal principle of justice in favor of "complex equality" where different social goods (healthcare, education, political power, money) are distributed according to different principles appropriate to their social meanings. Argues against "dominance" where success in one sphere (e.g., wealth) converts to success in others. No good x should be distributed merely because one possesses good y. Different communities may interpret goods differently. RELEVANCE: Offers pluralist alternative to Rawlsian uniformity, directly relevant to housing as a distinct sphere with its own distributive logic. Walzer's recognition that some goods have meanings tied to community and cannot be reduced to abstract resources provides theoretical support for treating spatially-embedded goods distinctively. However, leaves open which principles govern housing/spatial goods specifically. POSITION: Pluralist justice, complex equality, communitarian social meanings, anti-dominance.},

Uses desert island auction thought experiment where shipwrecked people bid for resources using equal initial endowments; distribution is equal when no one envies another's bundle. Distinguishes option luck (risks deliberately taken) from brute luck (random misfortune), arguing equality requires compensating for brute luck disadvantages but not option luck. Resources not welfare should be equalized. RELEVANCE: Influential resourcist approach but assumes goods are fungible and tradeable through market mechanisms. Housing and location create envy-test complications: even with equal budgets, spatial scarcity means not everyone can occupy desirable locations. Our project explores whether resource equality can accommodate positional/located goods or requires supplementation.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques reduction of justice to distributive justice, arguing this paradigm treats justice as static pattern of goods allocation while ignoring processes, decision-making structures, division of labor, and culture. Identifies five faces of oppression (exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, violence) that cannot be reduced to distributive dimensions. Argues for justice as enablement of self-development and self-determination, requiring attention to political participation, recognition, and social structures beyond distribution. RELEVANCE: Foundational critique of distributive paradigm highly relevant to spatial justice. Young argues that focusing only on who gets what ignores how urban space is produced, who decides land use, whose cultures are recognized in public space. Her framework suggests housing justice requires examining power structures, political participation in planning, and recognition of diverse communities, not just fair allocation.

  doi = {10.1086/233897},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques luck egalitarianism for focusing on distribution of non-relational goods among individuals rather than social relations. Argues proper aim of egalitarian justice is creating community where people relate as equals, eliminating oppression rather than equalizing brute luck effects. Democratic equality requires citizens relate as equals (political equality), equal standing (social equality), and capabilities to function as equals. Opposes pity-based redistribution, favors dignity-preserving social insurance and opportunity provision. RELEVANCE: Relational egalitarianism offers alternative framework for spatial justice beyond allocating housing as resource. Anderson suggests focus on whether urban arrangements create relations of equality or hierarchy, stigma, domination. Relevant to segregation, concentrated poverty, exclusionary zoning as creating relational inequality. Our project can draw on relational framework to argue housing justice concerns social relations in communities, not just resource distribution.

@book{sen1999development,
  author = {Sen, Amartya},
  title = {Development as Freedom},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1999},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues development should be understood as expansion of substantive freedoms (capabilities) people enjoy, not merely economic growth or income. Capabilities are real freedoms to achieve functionings (beings and doings) one has reason to value. Distinguishes capabilities (what one can do/be) from functionings (actual achievements) and commodities (resources). Justice requires capability equality, not welfare or resource equality, because what matters is what people can actually do with resources given conversion factors (personal, social, environmental). RELEVANCE: Capabilities approach widely applied to spatial justice and housing. Unlike resourcist theories, capabilities framework can capture how place affects ability to convert resources into functionings—same income yields different capabilities in different neighborhoods (access to jobs, schools, safety). Basta (2016), Dummer (2025), and others use capabilities for housing justice. Our project can draw on Sen to argue temporal claims connect to capabilities: displacement destroys established capabilities regardless of compensation.

  title = {Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops capabilities approach with specific list of ten central human capabilities (life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses/imagination/thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, control over environment) required for life worthy of human dignity. Unlike Sen, argues for substantive universal list grounded in human dignity. Capabilities are what people are able to do and be, not just resources they have. Governments must ensure all meet capability thresholds as matter of basic justice and human rights. RELEVANCE: Nussbaum's list includes "control over one's environment" (both political participation in governance and material control, including land and property), directly relevant to housing and spatial justice. However, critics (including Dummer 2025) argue her list inadequately captures housing-specific concerns and lacks relational elements important for positional goods. Her threshold approach raises questions about spatial inequality above thresholds. Provides framework for housing as basic entitlement but may need supplementation for place-specific justice.

@book{hirsch1976social,
  author = {Hirsch, Fred},
  title = {Social Limits to Growth},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1976},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces concept of "positional goods" whose value depends on relative position in distribution, not absolute quantity. As economies grow and incomes rise, increasing proportion of goods are positional—their utility depends on others not having them (elite education, scenic views, suburban neighborhoods, status goods). Unlike material goods which can be expanded, positional goods face absolute scarcity—if everyone has them, no one benefits. This creates "zero-sum" competition and social limits to growth that economic expansion cannot overcome. Distributive conflicts intensify as positional goods become more important. RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding housing as positional good. Desirable neighborhoods are inherently scarce—cannot simply produce more "good locations." If housing has positional elements, standard distributive principles assuming expandable goods may fail. Hirsch's analysis suggests housing justice faces distinctive challenges from positional scarcity. Our project can draw on positional goods theory to explain why temporal claims (established position in desirable location) create justice issues beyond resource distribution. Recent work (2025) re-examines Hirsch's insights for distributive justice implications. POSITION: Positional goods theory, social limits to growth, scarcity, zero-sum competition.},

  address = {New York},
  year = {1992},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes principles and procedures institutions actually use to allocate scarce goods (college admissions, organ transplants, military conscription, worker layoffs) and necessary burdens. Distinguishes "local justice" (context-specific allocation principles) from "global justice" (society-wide distributive principles). Shows how institutions choose among equality, equity (merit/desert), efficiency, and need as allocation criteria, and how these interact. Allocation procedures may aggregate or balance principles differently. Argues actual allocation mechanisms often poorly match stated principles and may worsen inequalities. RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to housing allocation mechanisms. Elster shows how different allocation principles (lottery, queue, need, merit, market) apply to scarce non-divisible goods. Housing allocation uses multiple mechanisms (market, public housing waitlists, zoning, historical occupancy) each with different justice implications. His analysis of preference-formation and procedure-principle gaps illuminates housing policy debates. Our project can use Elster's framework to analyze temporal claims as one allocation principle (first-come priority, established occupancy) competing with others.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that justice has a geography and that spatial distribution of resources, services, and access is a basic human right. Develops concept of "spatial justice" as distinct from social justice, focusing on fair distribution across space and just production of space itself. Shows how locational discrimination creates unjust geographies through urban planning, zoning, redlining, and spatial structures of privilege. Draws on Lefebvre and Harvey to argue space is socially produced and political. Uses Los Angeles case studies to demonstrate spatial injustice and struggles for spatial justice. RELEVANCE: Foundational work establishing spatial justice as distinct field. Soja argues geography is not merely backdrop to justice but constitutive—spatial arrangements themselves produce and reproduce injustice. Directly relevant to housing justice as spatial justice. However, Soja's framework remains largely descriptive and political; philosophical foundations for specifically spatial distributive principles remain underdeveloped.

  year = {1973},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Marxist analysis of how capitalism produces unjust urban space through uneven development, spatial fixes for capital accumulation crises, and commodification of land and housing. Argues urban spatial form reflects and reproduces class relations and capital accumulation imperatives. Justice requires examining not just distribution of goods but production of space itself and underlying property relations. Later work develops "right to the city" concept from Lefebvre—collective right to reshape urban space according to human needs not profit. RELEVANCE: Foundational critical geography text arguing spatial arrangements are products of capitalist political economy, not natural or neutral. Housing justice requires examining property relations, speculation, and capital flows, not just allocation principles. Harvey's framework suggests limits of liberal distributive justice for addressing spatial inequality rooted in capitalism. Our project must engage with critique that distributive approaches treat symptoms (unequal housing) not causes (commodification, property rights).

  address = {Ithaca},
  year = {2010},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops normative theory of urban justice based on three principles: equity (fair distribution), diversity (social/economic mixing, not segregation), and democracy (meaningful participation). Critiques communicative planning paradigm for assuming procedural fairness yields substantive justice without addressing structural inequalities. Argues capitalist cities can be made more just through progressive planning even without revolution. Synthesizes Rawls, Young, Sen, Harvey, and Nussbaum for urban context, proposing pragmatic progressive reform. RELEVANCE: Influential urban planning application of distributive justice theories. Fainstein recognizes tension among her three principles and need for balancing. Her equity principle covers housing allocation but diversity and democracy add non-distributive dimensions. Framework is explicitly spatial and urban, bridging philosophy and planning. Useful for our project's engagement with housing policy.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes racially segregated, economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods ("dark ghettos") as symptoms of systemic injustice in American social structure, not merely unfortunate outcomes or cultural pathologies. Applies Rawlsian justice framework to argue ghettos violate principles of reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, and civic equality. Residents have civic duty to improve conditions but not to self-reform per mainstream respectability politics—injustice lies in basic structure. Segregation per se is morally neutral; injustice is the concentrated disadvantage and limited opportunities it enables. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated philosophical analysis of spatial injustice, segregation, and concentrated poverty. Shelby shows how distributive justice principles apply to geographic concentration of disadvantage. Directly relevant to housing justice and temporal claims—displacement from gentrifying ghettos raises questions about residents' claims to place despite neighborhood's injustice. Shelby's framework treats spatial arrangements as part of basic structure subject to justice principles. However, focuses more on obligations than entitlements; less developed theory of positive housing rights or allocation principles.

  author = {Stilz, Anna},
  title = {Territorial Sovereignty: A Philosophical Exploration},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2019},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops Kantian theory of territorial rights based on individual autonomy requiring protection of three territorial interests: occupancy (stable use of land), basic justice (effective law), and self-determination (collective governance). Legitimate states have territorial rights when they implement law governing property, subjects have legitimate occupancy claims, state rules in name of people protecting rights and participation, and state is not usurper. Territorial rights ground claims against displacement and support territorial jurisdiction. Recent work (2024) applies framework to climate displacement. RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for occupancy rights and claims against displacement. Stilz's occupancy interest grounds moral significance of established residence beyond property ownership. Relevant to temporal dimension of housing claims—long-term occupancy creates justice-relevant interests even without ownership. However, Stilz focuses on state territory and self-determination, not intra-state housing distribution.

  pages = {68--93},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues contemporary justice struggles require both redistribution (economic justice) and recognition (cultural justice). Redistribution addresses economic injustice (exploitation, marginalization) through political-economic restructuring. Recognition addresses cultural injustice (cultural domination, non-recognition, disrespect) through cultural change. Some groups face primarily redistribution issues (class), others primarily recognition issues (sexuality), many face both (race, gender). Proposes "participatory parity" as normative framework—justice requires social arrangements permitting all to participate as peers. Later adds representation (political voice) as third dimension. RELEVANCE: Fraser's two-dimensional (later three-dimensional) justice framework is widely applied to spatial justice. Housing involves both redistribution (who gets housing resources) and recognition (whose neighborhoods are valued, whose communities count). Segregation and urban inequality have both economic and cultural dimensions. Relevant to our project's analysis of housing beyond pure distribution—community recognition, voice in planning, cultural respect matter.

  title = {Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale: The Moral Limits of Markets},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2010},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes when and why certain markets are "noxious"—morally objectionable even if voluntary and welfare-improving. Develops four-parameter framework: markets are problematic when they involve (1) vulnerability of participants, (2) weak agency (deception, coercion, limited understanding), (3) extremely harmful individual outcomes, or (4) extremely harmful social outcomes (reinforcing inequality or discrimination). Examines prostitution, commercial surrogacy, child labor, kidney sales. Some goods' social meanings or distribution methods matter morally, not just final allocations. RELEVANCE: Satz's framework for special goods and market limits is relevant to housing commodification debates.

Her framework suggests pure market allocation of housing may be noxious even if Pareto-improving.

Argues justice fundamentally concerns eliminating inequalities due to brute luck (circumstances beyond control), not merely improving worst-off position.

Relevant to housing justice debates about whether spatial inequality due to circumstances (where one is born) is unjust requiring correction, or acceptable if markets improve overall access.

DOMAIN: Temporal Dimensions of Justice and Path Dependency
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-14
PAPERS_FOUND: 21 (High: 12, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Google Scholar, Web Search (Philosophy & Public Affairs, Journal of Political Philosophy, Ethics, Res Publica, Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy)
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The temporal dimension of justice addresses how justice principles apply across time, including obligations between past, present, and future generations who may not coexist. This rapidly developing field encompasses several interconnected strands: (1) diachronic vs. synchronic justice - whether justice should be assessed at a single time-slice or across the entire course of lives/societies; (2) historical injustice and rectification - whether and how past wrongs generate present obligations, including the "supersession thesis" that changing circumstances can alter what justice requires; (3) intergenerational justice - what present generations owe to future (and past) people, complicated by the non-identity problem; (4) path dependency - how historical choices constrain present options and create temporal lock-in effects; (5) temporal priority principles - how to weight past occupancy versus current need versus future opportunity in allocating scarce located goods like housing and territory.

Key debates include: Waldron's supersession thesis (1992) versus critics arguing historical claims persist despite changed circumstances; Rawlsian time-slice principles versus historical entitlement theories (Nozick); person-affecting versus impersonal approaches to future generations; backward-looking (reparative) versus forward-looking (distributive) justice. Recent work (2015-2025) has applied these frameworks to climate justice, territorial rights, gentrification, indigenous land claims, and colonial reparations. The field has evolved from abstract philosophical puzzles to urgent practical applications, with significant empirical and normative integration.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is CENTRAL to the housing justice research project. The core challenge - adjudicating between incumbent residents' claims based on past occupancy versus newcomers' claims based on present/future need - is precisely a temporal justice problem. The project requires principles for: (1) how to weight historical attachment and investment versus current housing need; (2) whether historical injustices (redlining, urban renewal, displacement) create persistent claims or can be superseded; (3) how path dependency constrains just housing allocation (e.g., neighborhoods shaped by past discrimination); (4) temporal framing of housing rights (moment-in-time vs. life-course vs. intergenerational). The supersession debate directly addresses whether gentrification-induced displacement wrongs can be rectified or are overtaken by changed circumstances. Occupancy rights theory provides conceptual tools for understanding place-based claims that accumulate over time.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The field has seen explosive growth 2015-2025 with major monographs on territorial justice (Moore 2015, Stilz 2019, Nine 2022), intergenerational justice (Bidadanure 2021, Gosseries 2023, Truccone 2024), and climate justice (Caney's work 2014-2024). The supersession thesis has been comprehensively debated through Meyer & Waligore's 2022 special issue and 2023 book. Critical innovations include: Stilz's defense of occupancy rights independent of historical title; Bidadanure's integration of age-group justice with diachronic evaluation; Krishnamurthy & Moore's 2024 application to gentrification; Truccone's 2024 synthesis addressing post-colonial and climate injustices; growing attention to relational egalitarianism's temporal limits (Lippert-Rasmussen 2025). Empirical turn includes neuroscience of temporal discounting, behavioral economics of intertemporal choice, and climate science urgency.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited direct application to urban housing allocation (Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024 is exception). Few works integrate temporal justice with located goods theory - most focus on fungible resources or abstract territory. Underdeveloped empirical operationalization of philosophical concepts like "reasons-responsiveness over time" or "occupancy rights thresholds." Little engagement with short-term rental markets, housing financialization, or demographic transitions. Insufficient attention to intersectionality - how temporal claims interact with race, class, and migration status over time. Need for more work on institutional design for temporal justice (beyond climate assemblies). Path dependency remains more descriptive (legal/economic) than normative (philosophical).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For the literature review, prioritize: (1) Waldron (1992) and Meyer & Waligore (2022) on supersession as conceptual foundation; (2) Goodin (2010) on temporal justice framework; (3) Gosseries (2023) and Thompson (2002) on intergenerational obligations; (4) Stilz (2013, 2019) and Moore (2015) on occupancy and territorial rights; (5) Krishnamurthy & Moore (2024) as direct application to gentrification. Key tension: backward-looking historical claims versus forward-looking distributive justice - housing project must navigate this. Distinguish pure historical entitlement (Nozick, problematic for displacement) from occupancy-based claims (Stilz, more promising) from pure distribution (Rawls, ignores attachment). Consider how path dependency creates moral constraints on distributive justice even if historical claims don't persist indefinitely.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical supersession: 5 papers - Waldron's thesis that changed circumstances can supersede historical claims
- Anti-supersession/persistent claims: 4 papers - Meyer, Thompson, Butt arguing historical injustices create enduring obligations
- Intergenerational justice theories: 4 papers - Gosseries, Caney, Bidadanure on obligations across time
- Occupancy rights theory: 3 papers - Stilz, Moore, Nine on place-based temporal claims
- Temporal framing/diachronic justice: 3 papers - Goodin, Truccone on how time affects justice assessment
- Applications (climate, territory, gentrification): 2 papers - Recent applied work

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Advances the "supersession thesis" - if a historical injustice occurs at time T1 leading to an unjust situation, morally relevant changes in circumstances can occur such that at time T2 justice does not require (and may prohibit) rectification to the original situation. Uses indigenous land claims as paradigm case, arguing population increases and environmental changes mean historical entitlements can no longer be justified relative to contemporary needs. The thesis holds that a distribution of resources that was unjustly established may become a just (or not unjust) distribution in the present given changed circumstances. RELEVANCE: Foundational to temporal justice debates and directly applicable to housing displacement. If supersession holds, incumbent residents' claims based on past occupancy could be overridden by newcomers' current needs when circumstances change sufficiently (e.g., urban development, population growth). However, if supersession fails, historical displacement wrongs create persistent claims.

The non-overlap problem applies to displaced former residents who no longer exist in neighborhood versus future newcomers.

  doi = {10.1017/S0047279409003231},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces concept of "temporal justice" - distributive justice should extend beyond monetary resources to include time, specifically discretionary time (time over which one has autonomous control after necessary tasks). Magnitude of gap between discretionary time enjoyed by best and worst off is measure of temporal injustice. Argues justice requires considering not just what resources people have but also when they can use them and how much control they have over timing. Shows substantial variation across countries (larger gaps in US/Australia, smaller in Finland/Sweden). RELEVANCE: Housing has profound temporal justice implications. Long commutes from affordable housing reduce discretionary time. Displacement disrupts temporal rhythms of community participation and family life. Gentrification often forces time-poverty trade-offs (more hours worked farther from home to afford rising rents). Housing stability provides temporal security for long-term planning. The project should integrate temporal justice framework - housing allocation affects not just what people have but their control over time and life-course planning.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends robust obligations to repair historical injustices against supersession arguments. Current generations of political societies have obligations to repair injustices committed by predecessors because maintaining a just political society requires each generation to keep commitments and repair injustices of predecessors. Uses intergenerational ties within nations and family lines to establish links between current obligations and past injustice. Argues that justice requires not just forward-looking distribution but backward-looking rectification - historical wrongs create enduring moral debts. Examines apology, reparations, and restorative justice for slavery, colonialism, and indigenous dispossession. RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to historical housing injustices (redlining, urban renewal, discriminatory lending, forced displacement). If Thompson is right, communities facing current gentrification may have persistent claims based on past displacement, even if circumstances have changed. Intergenerational family ties mean descendants of displaced residents have standing for reparations. The project must address whether housing policy should be purely forward-looking (distributive) or must incorporate backward-looking (reparative) elements.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory of occupancy rights - people's preinstitutional moral claims to specific geographical places where they permanently reside, participate in ongoing practices, and are immune from removal. Occupancy rights are temporally acquired through residence and life-planning but don't depend on historically "clean" title - can be established even after unjust dispossession. Distinguishes occupancy (location-specific) from property (transferable). Argues removal from one's place of occupancy is serious wrong even without full ownership. Present occupancy generates moral claims independent of how the occupancy began. RELEVANCE: Powerful framework for housing justice and gentrification. Longtime residents acquire occupancy rights through residence, community participation, life-planning around place, even if they rent rather than own. Displacement violates these rights. Crucially, occupancy rights can arise despite unjust past (neighborhood shaped by redlining) - current residents' claims don't require perfect historical title. This helps address path dependency: even if neighborhood resulted from injustice, current occupants have genuine claims. The project can use occupancy rights to explain wrongness of gentrification displacement independent of property ownership.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends political self-determination theory of territorial rights. Peoples (not states or cultural nations) have rights to territories through legitimate occupancy - members residing in territory and planning lives around relationship to it. Three foundations: individual moral rights of residency, collective moral rights of occupancy, and peoples' rights of self-determination. Occupancy generates jurisdiction rights. Addresses corrective justice for historical territorial injustices, arguing past wrongs must be balanced against present occupancy claims. Time matters: longer occupancy strengthens claims, but passage of time doesn't automatically erase injustice. RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to urban neighborhoods as territories. Residential communities constitute "peoples" with collective self-determination interests. Long-term residents have both individual residency rights and collective occupancy rights to their neighborhood. Gentrification threatens territorial self-determination - community loses control over neighborhood's future. Moore's framework for historical injustice applies to redlining, urban renewal: past wrongs matter but must be weighed against present occupants' claims.

Develops detailed account of occupancy rights: right to permanently reside, participate in ongoing practices, immunity from removal, and return if temporarily absent. Crucially argues present occupancy rights don't depend on historically clean title - can arise after dispossession. Discusses "layered" territorial rights when multiple groups have claims. Addresses expulsion, return, and resettlement across time. Temporal dimension central: occupancy establishes over time, but unjust past doesn't necessarily invalidate present claims. RELEVANCE: Expanded framework for housing justice. Occupancy rights include participation in social/cultural/economic practices - exactly what gentrification disrupts. Immunity from removal and right of return directly address displacement. "Layered rights" concept helps analyze neighborhoods with multiple temporal claimants (displaced former residents, current residents, potential newcomers). Stilz's argument that unjust origins don't vitiate present occupancy applies to path dependency in housing: neighborhoods shaped by discrimination can still ground legitimate occupancy claims by current residents.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory of age-group justice combining complete life egalitarianism, lifespan prudence, and relational egalitarianism. Some inequalities between age groups matter independently of their diachronic impact - relational reasons for equality at each life stage. Distinguishes temporary age-group inequalities (acceptable if everyone experiences them across complete life) from generational inequalities (problematic when temporary inequalities become permanent for cohorts, as after 2008 recession). Temporal perspective essential: justice assessment requires both synchronic (moment-in-time) and diachronic (across lifespan) evaluation. RELEVANCE: Housing allocation has profound age-group dimensions. Young adults priced out of urban housing face both age-group inequality (synchronic) and potential generational inequality if they never recover access (diachronic). Elderly longtime residents facing displacement lose life-stage appropriate housing. Bidadanure's framework suggests housing justice must consider: (1) fair distribution across age groups at given time, (2) fair distribution across complete lives, (3) relational equality at each life stage. Temporal framing matters: policy benefiting young today may be prudent life-course investment, but systematic exclusion of cohort is unjust. The project should assess whether housing inequality between age groups reflects acceptable life-course variation or unjust generational stratification.

Argues none justify delaying aggressive climate mitigation. Pure time discounting is unjust discrimination based on when people are alive. Temporal location should not affect moral weight. Analyzes "harmful short-termism" in politics - mismatch between timespan of climate problem and temporal horizons of citizens/politicians. RELEVANCE: Temporal discounting applies to housing justice. Should future residents' housing needs be discounted compared to current residents' attachment? Caney's argument against temporal discrimination suggests not - future generations' need for affordable housing matters equally to current displacement concerns. However, epistemic uncertainty about future (who will live where, what housing needs will be) complicates this. Short-termism in housing policy parallels climate: political incentives favor current homeowners over future renters, creating generational inequity. The project should examine temporal discounting in housing allocation - do we systematically underweight future housing needs and overweight present occupancy claims?

Colonialism created three morally relevant connections to past: benefit (contemporary states benefited from colonial exploitation), entitlement (resources were wrongfully taken), and responsibility (current political communities succeeded colonial powers). Even without direct causal benefit, responsibility-based claims persist. Historical injustice raises distinct theoretical problems requiring temporal analysis. Distinguishes between compensation (making victims whole) and restitution (returning what was taken). Passage of time complicates but doesn't eliminate rectificatory duties. RELEVANCE: Framework applies to historical housing injustices. Contemporary property distributions reflect past redlining, urban renewal, discriminatory lending - current homeowners/developers benefit from unjust system. Communities that were redlined have entitlement claims to what was denied. Political jurisdictions (cities, housing authorities) bear responsibility as successors to institutions that perpetrated injustice. The project must address whether rectificatory justice requires: (1) compensation for past displacement, (2) restitution of housing/neighborhoods, (3) symbolic reparations, or (4) structural reform.

Argues historical injustice persists across time through these connections, generating duties for contemporary affluent states to world's poorest peoples. Distinguishes restitution (returning specific items) from compensation (equivalent value). Examines how passage of time affects claims: delayed compensation must account for interest/opportunity costs; supersession requires very strong changed circumstances. Addresses non-identity problem: even if specific victims no longer exist, communities/peoples persist with claims. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated framework for temporal dimension of rectificatory justice applicable to housing. Urban housing wealth reflects historical injustice (segregation, redlining, contract buying, urban renewal) - current property owners benefit from unjust system even without directly causing harm. Displaced communities and their descendants have entitlement claims. Cities/housing authorities bear responsibility as successor institutions. The project needs principles for: how much weight to give rectification versus current distribution, how to compensate for delayed justice (displaced residents lost decades of asset appreciation), when changed circumstances supersede claims.

Nations are collective agents with temporal continuity - they share past history and inherit benefits from previous generations, so current members can be collectively responsible for past actions.

RELEVANCE: Framework extends to cities/neighborhoods as collective agents with temporal continuity. Current urban residents inherit benefits from past policies (homeownership subsidies, infrastructure investment) and bear responsibility for past injustices (redlining, displacement). Correspondence model suggests appropriate redress depends on injury type: forced removal requires right of return or housing priority, wealth extraction requires monetary reparations, community destruction requires rebuilding institutions.

Colonial wrongs: (1) forcing people into political associations non-consensually, and (2) establishing association terms through unequal, non-reciprocal power. Even if colonialism brought benefits, the relational wrong persists - justice requires equal standing in determining collective political life. Historical aspect: colonial relationships established in past continue shaping present political structures and economic relations. Past domination creates present structural inequality. Temporal dimension: relational injustice doesn't simply end when formal colonialism ends; legacy persists in institutions and material conditions. RELEVANCE: Gentrification as relational injustice paralleling colonialism. Longtime residents forced into new "political association" (neighborhood governance, community character) they didn't consent to, with terms set by powerful newcomers/developers rather than equal negotiation. Even if gentrification brings benefits (investment, services), the relational wrong remains - displacement of existing community, loss of self-determination over neighborhood future. Ypi's framework suggests housing justice requires not just fair distribution but equal standing in decisions about community. Temporal dimension: historical displacement creates persistent relational inequality - communities lack power to shape neighborhood because past injustice excluded them from political/economic institutions.

Gentrification violates all three simultaneously. Place-attachment has temporal dimension - deepens over time through lived experience, relationships, and investment. Displacement severs these temporal connections. Framework addresses standard objections: not just about property ownership (renters have place-rights), not purely distributive (relational and participatory dimensions), not contingent on community homogeneity. RELEVANCE: Most directly applicable paper to housing justice project! Provides philosophical framework specifically for gentrification wrong. Three place-rights map onto temporal dimensions: home rights (stable shelter over time), residency rights (temporal membership in community), community rights (participation in ongoing practices). Temporal aspect central: long-term residence strengthens all three types of claims through deeper attachment, thicker relationships, greater investment. The project can use this framework to explain why displacement wrongs even long-term renters (residency and community rights), why it matters even if displaced find equivalent housing elsewhere (place-specificity), and how temporal occupancy grounds moral claims independent of property ownership. Critical for operationalizing temporal justice in housing context. POSITION: Gentrification wrongs by violating temporally-accrued place-based rights to home, residency, and community.},

Groups are spatially interconnected through shared resources (rivers, urban areas), requiring collective management through nested and overlapping jurisdictions. Develops "functional autonomy" concept - self-determination measured by performance of specific political functions rather than exclusive territorial control. Foundational territories established around geographical interdependence may overlap existing state boundaries. Temporal dimension: territories emerge through ongoing resource management relationships over time, not just historical title. RELEVANCE: Innovative framework for urban housing. Neighborhoods are paradigmatic overlapping territories - multiple groups (longtime residents, recent arrivals, commuters, landlords, city-wide community) have legitimate but overlapping claims based on different relationships to place. Exclusive territorial control by any single group is neither feasible nor just. Temporal claims vary: longtime residents have deep occupancy claims, newcomers have housing needs and emerging attachment, city has jurisdiction, landlords have property interests. Nine's functional autonomy suggests each group should have self-determination for specific functions rather than total control. Housing project could develop "overlapping housing rights" framework: different stakeholders with different temporal depths of claim exercising different types of authority (residency decisions, community character, development planning, resource allocation).

Argument from Temporal Non-Overlap: if social relations are crucial for justice (relational egalitarianism), but we don't socially relate to non-overlapping future generations, then relational egalitarianism provides incomplete justice theory. Defends relational egalitarianism by arguing temporal non-overlap doesn't preclude relevant relationships. However, acknowledges tension: standard relational accounts emphasize reciprocal relationships, but future people can't reciprocate. Examines scope and time-frame of egalitarian justice. RELEVANCE: Displacement involves temporal non-overlap. Former residents no longer present in neighborhood don't overlap with current/future residents. Can relational justice framework handle their claims? If justice requires actual relationships, do displaced people lose claims once they leave? Or do past relationships create enduring obligations? Housing project faces this puzzle: gentrification disrupts actual relationships (people scatter), but claims seem to persist. Lippert-Rasmussen's analysis suggests need for justice theory that handles both: relational dimensions (actual communities) and non-relational dimensions (obligations to non-overlapping past/future residents).

Justice principles don't simply apply timelessly; their content and demands shift based on temporal framing and rhythm. Normative reasoning operates at different temporal scales (moment-to-moment, life-course, intergenerational) producing different assessments. "Rhythm" metaphor captures how justice claims pulse and vary with temporal perspective. Addresses how to integrate synchronic (snapshot) and diachronic (across-time) evaluation. Temporal indeterminacy means same situation can yield different justice assessments depending on time-frame adopted. RELEVANCE: Housing justice exhibits profound temporal indeterminacy. Assess at single moment: newcomers need housing now. Assess across life-course: longtime residents have decades of investment. Assess intergenerationally: displaced communities lost generational wealth accumulation. Different time-frames support different claims. The housing project must address this temporal indeterminacy - not just which claims win but what temporal frame(s) are appropriate for assessment. Cockburn's "rhythm" metaphor helps understand how displacement disrupts temporal patterns of community life. Short-term fluctuations (new residents moving in) differ from long-term trends (systematic demographic replacement). Policy must navigate multiple temporal scales simultaneously.

States may regulate access to resources and determine exploitation, but shouldn't have exclusive control over income generated - should be redistributed to equalize access to well-being. Natural resources "exist independently of human contributions" so no historical entitlement justifies permanent exclusive control. Global equality demands dispersing resource rights away from nation-state. Even if state acquired territory justly, doesn't follow that it has permanent sovereignty over resource benefits. Temporal dimension: "permanent" sovereignty problematic - circumstances change, populations change, justice requirements change. RELEVANCE: Urban land is natural resource - location value not created by any individual. Armstrong's critique of permanent sovereignty challenges permanent exclusion of newcomers from valuable urban locations based solely on incumbency. If natural resources should be shared for global equality, urban land should be accessible to those needing housing, not permanently controlled by current residents/owners. However, occupancy creates legitimate claims beyond pure resource extraction. Temporal tension: Armstrong challenges historical entitlement giving permanent control, but occupancy builds over time creating strengthening claims. Housing project must navigate: natural resource dimension (land should be shared) versus occupancy dimension (residence creates place-specific claims).

DOMAIN: Housing Justice, Gentrification, and Displacement Ethics
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-14
PAPERS_FOUND: 25 (High: 14, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: WebSearch (Google Scholar, PhilPapers, SEP), Philosophy journals (Journal of Applied Philosophy, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Politics Philosophy & Economics), Urban Studies journals (Urban Studies, Housing Studies, Journal of Urban Affairs)
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines the ethics of housing allocation, gentrification, and displacement through multiple lenses: political philosophy, urban studies, and applied ethics. The field has experienced rapid growth since 2010, driven by escalating housing crises in major cities and increasing philosophical attention to urban justice.

Key debates center on whether housing is a special good deserving protection from market forces, what makes displacement wrongful, and how to balance competing claims between incumbent residents (who have established place-based attachments and community ties) and newcomers (who seek access to opportunity-rich neighborhoods). Recent work (2020-2025) has increasingly focused on autonomy-based accounts of displacement harms, with philosophers arguing that gentrification violates "occupancy rights" grounded in people's "located life plans" (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018; van Leeuwen 2025).

The literature reveals sharp divisions between critical scholars who view gentrification as inherently unjust displacement and those who emphasize its potential benefits (neighborhood revitalization, reduced segregation, economic development). Philosophical accounts increasingly move beyond simple utilitarianism to examine non-material harms (loss of community, phenomenological displacement, erosion of democratic spaces) and structural injustice frameworks. The financialization of housing has emerged as a major concern, with scholars examining how treating housing as a speculative asset conflicts with housing as a human right.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

Housing justice provides a crucial domain for analyzing temporal claims in resource allocation. The core tension is temporal: incumbents assert rights based on historical presence, place-attachment, and community-building labor, while newcomers assert rights based on equal access and non-discrimination. This directly addresses the research question of how temporal priority interacts with distributive justice principles. The displacement literature also connects to climate migration ethics, as rising housing costs in climate-safe cities create conflicts between climate refugees and existing residents.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:

The 2020-2025 period shows explosive growth in philosophical engagement with housing. Multiple papers published in top philosophy journals (Philosophy & Public Affairs, Journal of Applied Philosophy, Politics Philosophy & Economics) provide sophisticated normative frameworks. The COVID-19 eviction moratorium sparked renewed debate about tenant rights and property claims. Housing financialization scholarship has matured into a distinct sub-field linking political economy to normative theory. The capability approach and limitarianism have been applied to housing, expanding beyond traditional rights-based accounts.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Despite growth, several gaps remain: (1) Limited engagement with exclusionary zoning's ethical dimensions from a philosophical perspective (more policy than normative theory); (2) Insufficient attention to the temporal structure of housing claims - most work focuses on synchronic distribution rather than diachronic entitlements; (3) Little philosophical work directly addressing climate migration and housing justice intersections; (4) Under-theorized tension between integration (Anderson) and place-protection (Huber & Wolkenstein); (5) Minimal engagement with comparative justice across cities/nations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

For synthesis, distinguish between three levels of analysis: (1) Individual rights (Wells, Essert, Huber & Wolkenstein on occupancy rights, autonomy, and place-attachment); (2) Community goods (Lloyd, Draper on democratic communication and collective creation); (3) Structural injustice (Young, Shelby, Anderson on systemic patterns). The tension between incumbent protection and newcomer access is central. Consider how different normative frameworks (libertarian property rights, capability approach, structural injustice, right to housing) generate different policy prescriptions. Desmond's empirical work on eviction provides crucial grounding for philosophical theorizing.

KEY_POSITIONS:

- Pro-occupancy rights / Anti-gentrification: 8 papers - Emphasize place-attachment, autonomy, located life plans, community creation as grounds for incumbent protection (Huber & Wolkenstein, van Leeuwen, Lloyd, Lopez-Cantero)
- Right to housing advocates: 5 papers - Housing as human right or basic capability requiring state provision (Wells, Dummer & Neuhäuser, Madden & Marcuse, Desmond)
- Structural injustice theorists: 4 papers - Focus on systemic patterns, segregation, and basic structure reform (Young, Shelby, Anderson, Slater)
- Market critics / Financialization scholars: 3 papers - Examine commodification and financial speculation as injustice sources (Aalbers, Dancygier, Madden & Marcuse)
- Liberty-based approaches: 2 papers - Property rights and freedom as central (Essert, Christmas)
- Limitarianism: 1 paper - Excessive housing ownership as wrongful (Erck)
- Integration advocates: 1 paper - Prioritize breaking down segregation (Anderson)

DOMAIN: Territorial Rights, Place Attachment, and the Mobility-Stability Tension
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-14
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 (High: 10, Medium: 7, Low: 1)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Google Scholar, Cambridge Core, SAGE Journals, Oxford University Press
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The territorial rights literature asks what justifies a state's (or other political entity's) jurisdiction over a particular geographical territory. Recent scholarship has moved beyond state-level analysis to examine sub-state territorial claims, including neighborhood-level occupancy rights in gentrification contexts. Major theoretical traditions include: (1) nationalist theories grounding rights in cultural nations' relationships with homelands (Miller, Meisels); (2) self-determination theories connecting territorial rights to peoples' capacity for self-governance and occupancy (Moore, Stilz); (3) place-based or "river model" theories emphasizing ecological features and dense social relationships (Nine, Ochoa Espejo); and (4) associative ownership theories based on contributions to political institutions (Pevnick). A parallel literature on the philosophy of place (Malpas, Casey) provides phenomenological foundations for understanding the normative significance of place attachment, arguing that human being is inextricably bound to place and that this attachment grounds moral claims.

The mobility-stability tension emerges in debates about migration rights versus rights to remain in place. Cosmopolitan theorists (Benhabib) emphasize universal hospitality and porous borders, while communitarians stress the moral significance of rootedness and local attachments. Recent work has applied territorial rights frameworks to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have occupancy rights against displacement (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024). Climate displacement raises urgent questions about whether territorial rights include rights to remain when environmental change threatens habitability (Stilz 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to housing justice and temporal claims research because it addresses whether long-term residence generates moral claims to remain in a place. If occupancy theory is correct that people develop place-based life projects deserving protection, then temporal duration of residence becomes morally significant for housing policy. The literature provides sophisticated frameworks for thinking about neighborhood-level territorial claims, not just state-level borders. The tension between mobility (freedom to move) and stability (freedom to stay put) maps onto housing displacement debates where some emphasize economic mobility while others stress community rootedness and the right to stay put.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen an "urban turn" in territorial rights theory, with philosophers applying occupancy rights frameworks to gentrification and neighborhood change (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024, Draper 2024). Climate displacement has prompted new work on territorial justice when places become uninhabitable (Stilz 2024). A 2025 special issue in Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy advances "second wave" territorial rights theory engaging gentrification, Indigenous land rights, and foundational territories for resource management (Nine 2025). There is growing interest in place-based rights as distinct from property rights, with emphasis on how displacement harms autonomy by disrupting place-dependent life plans.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most territorial rights theory focuses on state-level or Indigenous peoples' claims, with limited work on intermediate scales like cities and neighborhoods. Few theorists have operationalized "occupancy" or "attachment" in ways that guide policy. The relationship between temporal duration and strength of territorial claim remains under-theorized. Little work bridges phenomenological accounts of place (Malpas, Casey) with normative political theory, despite potential synergies. The tension between cosmopolitan mobility rights and localist stability rights needs more systematic treatment, especially regarding housing.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on Stilz's occupancy theory (2009, 2019, 2024) as the core philosophical framework, particularly her account of how place-based life projects ground territorial claims. Contrast self-determination theories (Moore, Stilz) with place-based "river model" approaches (Nine, Ochoa Espejo). The recent gentrification literature (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024) shows how territorial rights theory applies to housing, making it essential for the state-of-the-art review. Phenomenological work (Malpas, Casey) provides deeper grounding for why place matters morally but needs integration with normative theory. The mobility-stability tension (Kotef 2015, Benhabib 2006) frames a core dilemma for housing justice.

DOMAIN: Urban Economics - Agglomeration, Spatial Lock-in, and Path Dependency
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-11-14
PAPERS_FOUND: 22 (High: 12, Medium: 8, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: NBER, Google Scholar, Journal websites, SEP
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Urban economics examines why economic activity clusters in cities and how housing markets mediate access to location-specific opportunities. The field has established that agglomeration economies—productivity gains from geographic concentration—drive urban growth through sharing mechanisms (labor pooling, input sharing), matching (specialized labor markets), and learning (knowledge spillovers). Recent empirical work has quantified how housing supply constraints, driven by both geographic factors and land use regulation, prevent workers from accessing high-productivity cities, reducing aggregate economic growth. This creates path-dependent development patterns where early infrastructure investments and regulatory choices lock in spatial configurations that persist across generations.

The literature reveals three interconnected mechanisms that make housing a non-fungible, location-specific good. First, agglomeration effects create substantial wage premiums in high-productivity cities (10-30% higher wages for equivalent workers). Second, housing supply inelasticity—caused by geographic constraints (mountains, oceans) and regulatory barriers (zoning, permitting delays)—means these productivity differences translate into housing price differences rather than population mobility. Third, this creates spatial lock-in where high housing costs prevent low-skill workers from accessing opportunity-rich locations, while infrastructure investments (highways, transit) create path dependencies that shape urban form for decades. Recent work shows these constraints reduced US GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009, with profound distributional consequences.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These economic findings provide the empirical foundation for philosophical debates about housing justice and temporal claims. The literature demonstrates that location is not fungible—places differ fundamentally in economic opportunity due to agglomeration effects that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Housing supply constraints create a direct mechanism by which past decisions (zoning laws enacted decades ago, infrastructure investments) restrict current generations' access to opportunities. The quantified magnitudes (36% GDP loss, 18% population decline from highways, regional income convergence halted after 1980) establish that these are not marginal effects but constitute major sources of injustice. This empirical basis is essential for normative arguments that current residents cannot claim exclusive rights to location-specific value they did not create.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The past decade has seen important empirical advances. First, better identification strategies (instrumental variables using planned highway routes, geographic constraints) have established causal effects of regulation on housing supply. Second, the "spatial misallocation" literature has quantified aggregate losses from housing constraints in high-productivity cities. Third, new data on gentrification and displacement has nuanced earlier claims, showing that original residents in gentrifying neighborhoods often benefit from remaining, though displacement remains a concern for renters. Fourth, the homogenization of housing regulations across previously high-elasticity sunbelt cities suggests the "suburban frontier is closing," potentially worsening affordability nationwide.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively documents agglomeration effects and supply constraints, several gaps remain relevant to normative analysis. First, limited work examines how much of urban land value derives from public vs. private investment (infrastructure, schools, amenities vs. private development). Second, the literature focuses on metropolitan-level effects but provides less guidance on neighborhood-scale justice questions (gentrification, displacement). Third, temporal dynamics receive less attention—most models are static equilibria rather than examining how past decisions constrain current choices. Fourth, normative questions about who should benefit from agglomeration economies and how to distribute gains remain largely outside economics' scope, creating space for philosophical contribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For the literature review, prioritize Hsieh & Moretti (2019) as the headline finding on aggregate costs of housing constraints. Use Combes & Gobillon (2015) and Moretti (2011) for comprehensive coverage of agglomeration mechanisms. Gyourko & Molloy (2015) and Saiz (2010) are essential for understanding supply constraints. Ganong & Shoag (2017) and Autor et al. (2013) show spatial mismatch and regional divergence. Fischel (2001) and Baum-Snow (2007) demonstrate path dependency and lock-in. For gentrification, Ellen & O'Regan (2011) and Dragan et al. (2020) provide nuanced evidence. The synthesis should emphasize how these findings collectively establish that location-specific value is real, substantial, and unequally accessible due to constraints rooted in past decisions.

Most inelastic markets (San Francisco, Miami, New York) are severely land-constrained by geography. Even controlling for regulation, geographic constraints independently reduce supply elasticity, though regulation matters too and may be partly endogenous to geography. RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing supply constraints are partly exogenous (geographic) not purely policy choices, complicating normative analysis. Some cities' high costs partly reflect genuine scarcity, not just exclusionary regulation. However, interaction between geography and regulation suggests path dependency—constrained cities adopt stricter regulation, amplifying constraints.

In inelastic markets (coastal cities), demand shocks cause large price increases; in elastic markets (sunbelt), same shocks cause building booms.

This quantifies aggregate costs of exclusionary policies and establishes that these are first-order effects on national welfare, not just local distributional concerns.

Transfer benefits (unemployment, disability, retirement, healthcare) rise sharply in trade-exposed areas, indicating adjustment costs are large and persistent.

Mechanism: land-use restrictions in high-income states raised housing costs, creating barriers to entry for less-skilled workers. Migration from low-wage to high-wage states drove 40-75% of century-long convergence. After 1980, high housing costs make migration no longer worthwhile for low-income workers—attorneys can still afford to move (housing 21% of income) but janitors cannot (rent 52% of income). RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing costs now prevent low-income workers from accessing high-wage regions, a fundamental change from historical pattern. This is direct evidence that exclusionary housing policies create spatial injustice by blocking economic mobility for those who need it most. The asymmetry (high-skilled can still move, low-skilled cannot) shows how housing constraints exacerbate inequality. The historical comparison demonstrates this is recent phenomenon, not inevitable, suggesting policy reforms could restore convergence.

Employment response to labor demand is less than 0.8% in supply-constrained places compared to 1% in unconstrained places, meaning constraints reduce employment growth by 20%+. RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing constraints don't just affect housing markets—they directly limit local employment growth and economic opportunity.

Most productive and valuable cities are typically coastal, sunny, mild, educated, and large. The approach reveals large differences in land rents—estimated at over 2x GDP nationally. RELEVANCE: Establishes that urban land values primarily reflect productivity differences (agglomeration economies) rather than just amenity differences. This matters normatively because productivity-based land values arguably should be shared more broadly (they reflect positive externalities, public investments) while amenity-based values might reflect legitimate preferences.

Rising incomes of rich explain roughly half of urbanization of rich (top income decile) and suburbanization of poor (bottom decile). Poor residents either displaced or pay higher rents for amenities they value less. RELEVANCE: Establishes that income inequality manifests spatially through neighborhood sorting, with high-income households bidding up prices in amenity-rich downtown areas. This spatial sorting has distributional consequences—poor households are made worse off through displacement or higher rents.

RELEVANCE: Provides political economy foundation for understanding exclusionary housing policies as rational homeowner behavior rather than mere prejudice or inefficiency. If correct, suggests that local control over land use inevitably produces exclusion when homeowners dominate, raising fundamental questions about appropriate level of government for housing decisions.

property rights are grounded in labor (Locke), occupancy/first possession,
personality development (Hegel), or social convention and utility. Contemporary
work has moved beyond monolithic theories to recognize property as a "bundle
of rights" (Honoré) or a pluralistic set of institutions serving multiple
values (Dagan). Recent scholarship has increasingly focused on how property
theory relates to housing justice, examining the property rights of tenants
and renters, the normative basis of adverse possession and squatting, and how
occupancy-based claims challenge traditional ownership models. The emergence
of "occupancy rights" theory (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein) represents a
significant development, arguing that long-term occupancy and use can ground
property-like claims even without formal ownership.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational for understanding how temporal claims to housing
might be grounded in property theory. The tension between formal ownership
and occupancy-based rights is central to housing justice debates. Property
theory provides conceptual frameworks for evaluating whether and when renters,
long-term occupants, or even squatters can claim property-like protections.
The distinction between use rights and ownership rights, and theories of how
property serves personhood and community, directly inform normative arguments
about housing security and tenant protections.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen significant philosophical attention to housing justice
as a distinct area of applied property theory. Scholars increasingly examine
how property rights interact with housing precarity, gentrification, and
homelessness. The development of "occupancy rights" as a theoretical framework
(distinct from both ownership and mere possession) represents an important
conceptual innovation. There's also growing interest in how property theory
must account for "located life plans" and the embeddedness of persons in
particular places, challenging traditional fungible conceptions of property.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While recent work has explored homelessness and gentrification, there remains
limited philosophical work on the specific property rights of long-term renters
and how temporal occupancy might ground incremental rights. The relationship
between adverse possession doctrine and normative housing claims is
under-theorized in contemporary philosophy (though legal scholars like Claeys
and Harding have made contributions). More work is needed on how property
pluralism (Dagan) applies specifically to residential property versus other
forms of property.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on the conceptual distinction between ownership, use rights, and
occupancy rights as these are central to temporal housing claims. Stilz's
occupancy theory and Wells's work on limited property rights for renters
provide key frameworks. The classic debate between labor theory (Locke),
personality theory (Hegel/Radin), and institutional pluralism (Dagan) should
frame the theoretical landscape. Pay special attention to how property theory
addresses housing specifically (Waldron, Essert, Halliday & Meyer) versus
property in general.
