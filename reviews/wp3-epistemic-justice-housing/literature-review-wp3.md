# State-of-the-Art Literature Review
## Work Package 3: Epistemic Justice and Housing

**Research Focus**: Developing a normative theory of Intergenerational Epistemic Justice for housing and urban planning, calibrated to the high reversal costs of the built environment.

---

## 1. Introduction: The Epistemic Challenge of Planning for Future Generations

Current approaches to epistemic justice in institutions focus primarily on how institutions treat present citizens—listening to marginalized voices, providing interpretative resources, and distributing credibility fairly (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013; Anderson 2006). However, this literature lacks a framework for **intergenerational epistemic justice**: how planning institutions should make spatial decisions that constrain future generations when we cannot know their preferences, values, or even their epistemic categories.

This literature review examines three interconnected domains that together establish the state of the art for WP3:

1. **Epistemology of Urban Planning**: How planning institutions generate, process, and act on knowledge about cities, particularly in European contexts
2. **Epistemology and Intergenerational Justice**: How we should make decisions affecting future generations under radical epistemic uncertainty
3. **Applied Planning Philosophy and STS**: Practical approaches to planning under uncertainty, including adaptive strategies and alternative institutional models

The review identifies a critical gap: while epistemic justice scholarship has examined institutional failures affecting present populations, and while intergenerational justice scholarship has addressed our moral obligations to the future, **no existing framework addresses the specific epistemic challenges of planning non-fungible, spatially-located goods with high reversal costs and unknown future preferences**.

## 2. Domain 1: Epistemology of Urban Planning

### 2.1 High Modernism and the Epistemic Critique of State Planning

James C. Scott's *Seeing Like a State* (1998) provides the foundational critique of "high modernist" planning—the belief that scientific-technical knowledge can comprehensively design social systems. Scott argued that large-scale state planning projects systematically failed because they privileged abstract, legible, "techne" knowledge over local, practical, contextual "metis" knowledge. The monocultural, one-dimensional nature of high-modernist projects failed to account for the complexity and dynamism of real-life urban systems.

Recent scholarship examines whether Scott's critique applies to contemporary algorithmic urbanism. Farrell (2020) argues that Silicon Valley's data-driven city initiatives replicate mid-20th century bureaucratic hubris with new technological foundations—the grand failed projects of rationalized cities like Brasilia are "close cousins to Facebook's failed ambitions to build a world of shared connections on algorithmic foundations." The 2021 *Polity* symposium (Klausen 2021; Smith 2021; Scott 2021) explored whether contemporary governance represents an over-extension of the state vision Scott critiqued.

### 2.2 Algorithmic High Modernism and Smart Cities

The "Smart City" paradigm represents what might be called **Algorithmic High Modernism**—rather than abandoning the synoptic view Scott criticized, the data-driven city promises that big data and predictive analytics can finally achieve what 20th-century planners could not (Kitchin 2014, 2017, 2021; Mattern 2021; Greenfield 2013).

**Critical Epistemological Analysis**: Cook and Karvonen (2024) examine how smart cities introduce new modes of knowledge politics in planning. The smart city agenda is founded on a **realist epistemology** that assumes reality can be known through systematic scientific methods. This creates a "computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logic and calculative rules and procedures, underpinned by an instrumental rationality and realist epistemology" (Cook & Karvonen 2024).

Kitchin (2017, 2021) argues that data-driven initiatives advance a narrowly conceived but powerful epistemology—"the city as visualised facts"—that reshapes how managers and citizens know and govern cities. He calls for "reconfiguring the underlying epistemology to openly recognize the contingent and relational nature of urban systems, processes and science."

Mattern (2021) emphasizes that cities encompass "myriad forms of local and indigenous intelligences and knowledge institutions" that algorithmic models systematically overlook. Smart city initiatives typically claim "a strong (and unjustified) belief in the objectivity and neutrality of the data and information derived from sensors, platforms and data analytics tools."

**The Forecasting Problem**: A critical epistemic failure of both traditional and algorithmic planning is **presentist bias in forecasting**—projecting current preferences and technologies onto the future. By optimizing for the most likely future scenario based on current values, planners create spatial structures that are brittle to change. This is particularly problematic because forecasting relies not only on demographic and economic projections but also on **assumptions about what people will value in the future**.

### 2.3 Local Knowledge vs. Expert Knowledge

Fox and Margalit (2025) propose moving "beyond the professional-local knowledge dichotomy" toward a new epistemology in urban planning. Their work addresses challenges from populist skepticism of the epistemic authority of planners, who are increasingly perceived as "unelected technocrats who serve elites."

Lay, local, and ethnographic knowledge are typically under-represented in planning knowledge bases, mainly due to the modern tradition of basing planning decisions on natural sciences and engineering. This creates "epistemological anxiety" in planning institutions, resulting in disregard of local inhabitants' experience-based, qualitative knowledge (Fox & Margalit 2025).

Saldert (2025) examines how the balance between **political and epistemic authority** affects planning legitimacy. Her Swedish case study shows that epistemic authority gains legitimacy only when actors accept each other's political and epistemic authority. **Trust is crucial** for ensuring legitimacy of planning processes and outcomes.

### 2.4 Path Dependency and Irreversibility in the Built Environment

Pierson (2000) established the concept of **path dependency** in political science, identifying four characteristics that generate path dependence: large set-up costs, learning effects, coordination effects, and adaptive expectations. These characteristics apply with particular force to urban infrastructure.

The built environment is durable, shaping people's lives for decades or centuries. Infrastructure is stabilized by "increasing returns" (Pierson 2000), creating incentives for policymakers, investors, and planners to deepen a particular path, making it even more costly to switch. Decision-makers construct urban areas according to established blueprints that are not easy to change, creating **lock-in effects** that have long-term impacts (Alembastar et al. 2021).

**Irreversibility as Constraint**: Path dependency in infrastructure creates a situation where "development of institutions and systems becomes intertwined and irreversible over time, creating interdependencies that complicate change and make transitions to alternative options difficult." Current infrastructure-investment risks create lock-in situations difficult to adapt or reverse, "closing down opportunities for the transformation needed to reduce systemic risks."

**Intergenerational Implications**: Decisions made today "can embed poverty, deny opportunity, and widen the urban services divide in ways that grow harder and harder to reverse. They also can lock in high energy consumption and carbon emissions for decades to come." A decision to build high-speed rail "absorbs capital and creates new economic corridors, but it also locks in specific energy consumption patterns and land-use changes for decades."

### 2.5 The German Housing Privatization: An Epistemic Failure Case

The German housing privatization of the early 2000s provides a paradigmatic case of epistemic failure in planning. Between 1999 and 2011, approximately 1.4 million housing units were sold off—almost 3.5% of Germany's entire housing stock (Schönig et al. 2020; Aalbers et al. 2017).

Berlin epitomizes this failure: its municipal housing stock declined from 482,000 units after reunification to approximately 273,500 in 2012 (Holm et al. 2017). The privatization was characterized by en-bloc sales of huge portfolios to "yield-oriented Anglo-American investors" (Aalbers et al. 2017).

**The Epistemic Error**: The policy was based on the forecast that "Germany is built" (*Deutschland ist fertiggebaut*)—an assumption that demographic decline and urban shrinkage would continue indefinitely. This forecast proved catastrophically wrong. The epistemic failure lay not merely in incorrect demographic predictions but in **the refusal to appropriately value the option of public control in case of unlikely demographic developments**.

Policymakers exhibited what might be called **hermeneutical rigidity**: the failure to update interpretative categories in light of shifting social realities. They optimized for the most likely scenario while discounting the option value of maintaining public ownership as a hedge against uncertainty.

## 3. Domain 2: Epistemology and Intergenerational Justice

### 3.1 Presentism and Democratic Myopia

Dennis F. Thompson (2010) identifies **presentism** as a systematic bias in democratic institutions—"Democracy is prone to what may be called presentism—a bias in the laws in favor of present over future generations." Thompson identifies characteristics of democracies that lead to presentism: the need to satisfy voting citizens often at the expense of those who come later, and the fact that political power is subject to temporal limits.

Thompson proposes **democratic trusteeship** as an alternative approach, where present generations act as trustees of the democratic process itself for future generations. However, his framework does not address the specific epistemic challenges of spatial planning.

Dobson and Zardo (2023) examine presentism as a form of **intergenerational domination**. The focus should be on including future generations on issues that may be "purpose-determining"—forcing future generations to exert substantial energies dealing with problems caused by predecessors. Spatial decisions are paradigmatically purpose-determining because they physically constrain the options available to future generations.

Janna Thompson (2009) presents a theory of intergenerational justice emphasizing that individuals are motivated by intergenerational concerns and have legitimate duties to both past and future generations. However, her framework addresses what we owe future generations without fully engaging the epistemic challenge of not knowing what they will value.

### 3.2 The Epistemic Problem of Unknown Future Preferences

The literature on intergenerational justice repeatedly encounters a fundamental epistemic barrier: **we do not know the preferences of future individuals** (SEP 2021; Jaeger et al. 2023; Howarth 2011).

Jaeger et al. (2023) note that "literature and policy documents are surprisingly vague on epistemic considerations" when conceptualizing future generations. **Our epistemic situation does not allow us to relate to future people as individuals**. The epistemic uncertainty related to identifying the interests of future generations is "a key barrier for conceptualizing their representation within current processes."

This creates a profound challenge: "Some argue that current generations have no obligations to future generations because we do not know the preferences of future individuals nor their explicit identities" (SEP 2021). However, "since future generations bear the burden of our decisions, people of today are seen to have a moral obligation to act in accordance with the interests of future generations" (Howarth 2011).

**Practical Approaches**: Tough (2003) tackles this by asking what future generations would need from us, identifying seven categories: Peace and security, Environment, Catastrophes, Governance, Knowledge, Children, and Learning. However, this approach assumes continuity in fundamental needs without addressing how values and preferences might radically shift.

### 3.3 Intergenerational Epistemic Injustice

Recent work extends Fricker's epistemic injustice framework to intergenerational contexts. Nascimento Rocha (2025) discusses "intergenerational formative epistemic injustice, which has persisted since colonial times," arguing this limits epistemic capacity formation across generations.

Research in information science has introduced "the concept of a Third Harm happening at an intergenerational level," building on Fricker's existing concepts of Primary and Secondary Harm (cited in Nascimento Rocha 2025). However, this work focuses on how past injustices constrain present epistemic capacities, not on how present decisions impose epistemic frameworks on future generations.

**Hermeneutical Injustice Across Time**: Fricker's concept of hermeneutical injustice—lacking interpretative resources to understand one's own experience—has temporal dimensions not yet fully theorized. When we make spatial decisions optimized for current value frameworks, we potentially impose hermeneutical constraints on future generations: the built environment they inherit reflects interpretative categories they may not share.

### 3.4 Organizational and Institutional Epistemic Virtues and Vices

Meyer (2023) develops an empirical approach to identifying epistemic vices in corporations, surfacing vices attributed to organizations by their own members. Critically, he identifies **rigidity** as an epistemic vice manifesting in "insensitivity to evidence." Tang (2024) notes that rigidity is associated with belief in conspiracy theories and endorsement of fake news—it represents a general failure to update beliefs in light of new information.

**Hermeneutical Rigidity**: While Meyer does not use this specific term, his work on organizational rigidity provides conceptual resources for developing the concept of **hermeneutical rigidity**—the institutional refusal to update interpretative categories despite shifting realities. This appears distinct from individual epistemic rigidity because institutions can exhibit hermeneutical rigidity even when individual members recognize the need for conceptual revision.

Lahroodi (2007) and Fricker et al. (2018) establish that epistemic virtues can be possessed by social collectives, not just individuals. Brady (2017) examines how collective entities function as epistemic agents and whether institutional virtues emerge from individual member traits or from irreducible collective properties.

A "virtuous epistemic culture is defined by an authentic motivation for knowledge, buttressed by norms that uphold epistemic virtues such as open-mindedness, intellectual courage, intellectual integrity, and epistemic responsibility" (Fricker et al. 2018). For planning institutions dealing with high reversal costs, **epistemic humility** becomes a crucial institutional virtue.

### 3.5 Epistemic Humility in Long-Term Decision-Making

Bleicher (2021) examines epistemic humility as "dealing with the stages and dynamics of scientific non-knowledge in political decision-making." This is crucial for institutions making decisions with long-term, irreversible consequences.

However, existing work on epistemic humility focuses primarily on acknowledging limits to current knowledge, not on the specific challenge of **institutional epistemic humility calibrated to the non-fungibility of goods being planned**. The epistemic humility required for managing fungible assets (where errors can be corrected through financial compensation) differs fundamentally from that required for non-fungible, spatially-located goods.

### 3.6 Fungibility and Irreplaceable Goods

Gosseries and Meyer (2022) propose the concept of **irreplaceable goods** as a bridge between sustainability and intergenerational sufficientarianism. They challenge the assumption that "resources are fungible across uses and time."

The **fungibility assumption** has led writers to support capital accumulation rather than specific obligations to conserve specific resources. However, for spatial goods, fungibility assumptions break down. Housing in a specific location cannot be replaced by housing elsewhere plus financial compensation—spatial goods have non-fungible characteristics.

The research establishes **cleronomic principles** defining what present generations owe based on what they received from previous generations: "identical replacement, equivalent replacement, and finally mere compensation" in descending order of preference. For spatially-located goods, identical replacement is often impossible, equivalent replacement is difficult, and mere financial compensation fails to address spatial specificity.

**Spatial and Temporal Dimensions**: Tremmel (2006) argues that "intergenerational justice requires spatial and temporal limits on political action." This acknowledges that spatial decisions have unique intergenerational implications, but the epistemic dimensions remain under-theorized.

## 4. Domain 3: Applied Planning Philosophy and STS

### 4.1 STS Approaches to Urban Planning

Science and Technology Studies (STS) offers critical perspectives on knowledge production in urban planning. Farías and Criado (2024) note that "focus on urban techno-politics is very topical and timely with efforts all over the world to turn cities into sustainable, smart, resilient cities, making a critical and reflexive STS perspective more than welcome."

Actor-Network Theory (ANT), with its background in STS, challenges conventional urban studies through its "critique of the explanatory value of such abstractions as 'class' and 'society' and its efforts to transcend society/nature and local/global binarisms" (Mohammad 2019). ANT enables exploration of "multiple spaces of a place in action," deepening understandings of quality, ambience, and urbanity.

### 4.2 Wicked Problems and the Limits of Technocracy

Rittel and Webber's (1973) concept of **wicked problems** provides another foundational critique of technocratic planning. They argued that "scientific and technocratic approaches for tackling difficult issues of social policy and urban planning were bound to be inadequate." Wicked problems are "innately resistant to any neopositivist formulations of scientific analysis and rigid linear protocols."

**Epistemological Dimensions**: Pesch and Vermaas (2020) emphasize that a "scientific approach to understanding the nature of these problems necessarily overlooks the significance of different stakeholder perspectives in the framing or constituting of social problems." This raises "epistemological issues about the respective contributions of scientific, political and stakeholder knowledge for understanding and resolving difficult issues."

Brown (2022) examines the friction between "demand for authentic political life and growing presence of technocratic planning." The wicked problems literature emerged from worry about a "tyranny of technocrats" that spurred the rise of participatory planning. **Pluralism is seen as an inherent feature of modern societies to be celebrated rather than suppressed through technocracy**.

Nikolaeva and Shakthi (2025) note that "strictly empirical and evidence-based urban knowledge practices have been widely critiqued, and planners argue that the term 'evidence' has only limited utility in understanding the nature of planning activity."

### 4.3 Adaptive Planning and Scenario Planning Under Uncertainty

Recent scholarship emphasizes transition from deterministic to uncertainty-based planning as a fundamental paradigm shift. Alembastar et al. (2025) identify adaptive planning as "supporting long-term decision-making under uncertainties in the built environment." Their systematic review identifies four emerging challenges: **multi-scale considerations, institutional rigidity and uncertainty avoidance, organizational capacity development, and the science-policy gap**.

Institutional rigidity and uncertainty avoidance emerge as critical barriers to adaptive planning—precisely the hermeneutical rigidity that WP3 aims to theorize.

**Scenario Planning**: Abou Jaoude et al. (2022) distinguish between exploratory scenario planning (broadening the range of possible futures) and two approaches to planning under uncertainty:
- **Contingent plans**: customized to specific scenarios
- **Robust plans**: work well across multiple possible futures

Buurman et al. (2025) propose an **Adaptive Multifutures Framework**: "A robust adaptive plan performs well across a wide range of plausible future scenarios and is designed to be adapted over time as new information arises or conditions change." This represents a fundamental paradigm shift: "The transition from deterministic to uncertainty-based planning represents a fundamental paradigm shift in urban planning practice."

Walker et al. (2017) emphasize that adaptive planning "stresses the need for places to have sufficient capacity to cope, respond and adapt to change, with strengthening adaptive capacity itself becoming a main objective of planning interventions."

### 4.4 Robust Decision-Making vs. Optimization

Lempert (2003) develops **Robust Decision Making (RDM)**, which "uses robustness rather than optimality as a criterion to assess alternative policies." This represents a fundamental trade-off: "stakeholders might be willing to trade off cost for robustness or vice versa."

**The Trade-off**: "Robustness can be defined as trading some optimal performance for less sensitivity to assumptions." RDM "runs models many hundreds to thousands of times to determine how plans perform in a range of plausible futures, with visualization and statistical analysis helping decisionmakers distinguish conditions in which their plans perform well from those in which their plans perform poorly."

Kingham et al. (2022) note that "for most systems of interest today (particularly social and economic systems), such prediction is not possible, due to their increasing complexity." Water managers and urban planners increasingly recognize that "robustness and flexibility often provide the best response to deeply uncertain future conditions."

**Precautionary Principle Extensions**: Beyazoglu et al. (2023) argue for enhancing the precautionary principle through "additional principles including transparency, fairness, and adaptability." This "addresses limitations in dealing with deep uncertainty in policymaking, enhancing robustness by considering multiple criteria."

### 4.5 Mixed-Use Zoning and Spatial Flexibility

Jane Jacobs (1961) was an early proponent of mixed-use zoning, believing it played a key role in creating "organic, diverse, and vibrant streetscape." She "vehemently argued against the sterility and social fragmentation produced by rigid zoning, advocating for the vitality and resilience of mixed-use neighborhoods."

Contemporary approaches emphasize that **zoning flexibility allows mixed-use developments to adapt to changing market conditions and demographic trends**. "As demand for office space declines and residential demand increases, developers can repurpose commercial zones for housing."

Flexible zoning "enables properties to evolve in response to changing economic conditions, societal needs, and market demands, fostering innovation, resilience, and sustainability by moving away from rigid, single-use zoning classifications."

**Performance-Based Approaches**: Performance-based zoning, "which focuses on desired outcomes rather than specific land uses, can provide greater flexibility for mixed-use development."

### 4.6 Public Land Banking and Option Value Preservation

Hartvigsen et al. (2021) document European land banking practices. In five Western European countries, "acquisition and sale land banking instruments have a high positive impact on the implementation of a variety of public policies related to agricultural and rural development."

In Germany (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), land banking "creates land pools at local level for ecological compensation measures and public initiated projects related to nature restoration, or used directly for public purposes, such as installation of public infrastructure."

**The Vienna Model**: Vienna provides the paradigmatic example of using public land ownership to preserve option value. The city's Land Procurement and Urban Renewal Fund currently holds 3,000,000 square metres reserved for new social housing construction (City of Vienna 2024).

Critically, "unlike Berlin and other European cities with high rates of private landownership, Vienna never sold off its public land." The city "buys land deemed suitable for residential development and retains control over the type and nature of development" (Reinprecht 2014).

Vienna directly owns approximately 220,000 municipal units—"the most public housing stock of any city in Europe." The city "maintained a tradition of retaining social-housing units as public property, not commodifying them, and proactively procuring land to provide building ground for affordable housing."

**Policy Continuity**: "No other European city can boast a similar constancy of its social housing policy—a policy that was never abandoned, not even when the spirit of the era was dictated by neoliberalism and privatisation" (Reinprecht 2014).

### 4.7 Modular Infrastructure and Avoiding Lock-In

Recent research emphasizes **modular infrastructure** as a strategy for maintaining adaptability. Nykamp et al. (2025) document a "shift from static, object-oriented urban components to adaptable, modular designs that balance functionality with environmental and social sustainability."

Modular construction offers "reduced material waste, shorter construction timelines, and enhanced design flexibility." Critically, "modular systems offer easy upgrades and ensure infrastructure can accommodate future changes" (Garrido et al. 2025).

**Avoiding Technology Lock-In**: "Proven strategies to avoid technology lock-in include the use of open standards, modularity, and supporting ecosystems to adapt to new technologies."

### 4.8 Master Planner vs. Custodian/Steward Models

Taylor et al. (2018) examine planner roles, contrasting rational comprehensive/"master planning" with incremental/"custodial stewardship" approaches.

**Master Planning**: The rational planning model "aims to systematically identify goals and all alternative strategies to select the optimal solution." Master planning "requires an accurate inventory of the population and of the land-use patterns existing in the area, economic and demographic predictions of what the future is likely to bring, a thorough understanding of the infrastructure that these future changes will require, and considerable imagination."

**Custodial/Stewardship Approach**: In contrast, incremental planning "proceeds piecemeal to iteratively select alternatives that are 'good enough'." This acknowledges "limitations of comprehensive planning and embraces a more gradual and adaptive approach."

**Key Differences**: "Rational decision making has a centralising bias, while incrementalism tends to favour representative and pluralist decision making." Additionally, "the rational model tends not to favour any community contribution while incrementalism leans towards widespread popular participation in decision making."

Stewardship in development involves "commitment to being a custodian of the whole development program, taking a long-term view of its design and delivery from pre-planning to post-occupancy and the in perpetuity legacy." Part of the custodial role "must be to engage and to listen, and to deliver on promises early; it is not to tell people what they want, but rather to create an environment encouraging and enabling conversation."

## 5. Research Gaps and Novel Contributions

The literature review reveals **seven major research gaps** that WP3 can address:

### Gap 1: No Framework for Intergenerational Epistemic Justice

**Current State**: Epistemic justice scholarship (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013; Anderson 2006) focuses on how institutions treat present citizens. Intergenerational justice scholarship (Thompson 2010; J. Thompson 2009) addresses moral obligations to future generations.

**Gap**: No existing framework addresses the **specific epistemic challenges of planning non-fungible, spatially-located goods with high reversal costs when we cannot know future preferences**.

**WP3 Contribution**: Develop a normative theory of Intergenerational Epistemic Justice calibrated to the irreversibility of spatial decisions.

### Gap 2: "Hermeneutical Rigidity" as Institutional Epistemic Vice

**Current State**: Meyer (2023) identifies organizational rigidity as epistemic vice. Fricker's hermeneutical injustice framework addresses individuals lacking interpretative resources.

**Gap**: No conceptualization of **hermeneutical rigidity** as the institutional refusal to update interpretative categories in light of shifting social realities, distinct from individual rigidity.

**WP3 Contribution**: Develop account of hermeneutical rigidity using German housing privatization as paradigmatic case. Show how institutions can exhibit this vice even when individuals recognize need for conceptual revision.

### Gap 3: Epistemic Humility Calibrated to Non-Fungibility

**Current State**: Bleicher (2021) examines epistemic humility for managing non-knowledge. Gosseries & Meyer (2022) distinguish fungible from irreplaceable goods.

**Gap**: No framework for **institutional epistemic humility specifically calibrated to non-fungible goods with high reversal costs**. The epistemic stance appropriate for fungible assets (correctable through compensation) differs fundamentally from that required for spatial goods.

**WP3 Contribution**: Develop account of epistemic humility for planning agencies dealing with located goods that does not apply to institutions managing fungible assets.

### Gap 4: Normative Theory of Option Value in Planning

**Current State**: Decision theory (Lempert 2003) and planning scholarship (Walker et al. 2017; Buurman et al. 2025) develop technical approaches to robust planning.

**Gap**: Lack of **normative justification for why legitimate planning must prioritize option value over optimization**. Existing work is primarily technical/instrumental rather than justice-based.

**WP3 Contribution**: Drawing on decision theory and intergenerational ethics, argue that legitimate planning must prioritize option value over optimization for most likely scenario. Develop justice-based argument for "resilient custodian" vs. "master planner" model.

### Gap 5: Connecting Scott's Critique to Algorithmic Urbanism

**Current State**: Scott (1998) critiqued high modernist planning. Smart city scholarship (Kitchin 2021; Mattern 2021; Cook & Karvonen 2024) critiques algorithmic urbanism.

**Gap**: Limited philosophical bridge between Scott's epistemological critique and contemporary algorithmic governance. Most connections remain suggestive (Farrell 2020) rather than systematically developed.

**WP3 Contribution**: Show how both high modernism and algorithmic urbanism exhibit same epistemic vice of presentist optimization, failing to preserve option value for future generations with different values.

### Gap 6: Scenario Planning as Epistemic Justice Requirement

**Current State**: Scenario planning (Abou Jaoude et al. 2022; Buurman et al. 2025) presented as technical best practice for managing uncertainty.

**Gap**: No argument that **scenario planning is required by epistemic justice** to future generations, not merely technically superior.

**WP3 Contribution**: Provide normative justification showing that, given epistemic uncertainty about future preferences, planning for multiple scenarios is justice requirement, not mere technical recommendation.

### Gap 7: Distinguishing Spatial from Temporal Fungibility

**Current State**: Gosseries & Meyer (2022) establish concept of irreplaceable goods but focus on natural resources and environmental goods.

**Gap**: Insufficient attention to **spatial non-fungibility**—the fact that housing in Location A cannot be replaced by housing in Location B plus compensation.

**WP3 Contribution**: Develop account of spatial non-fungibility and its implications for intergenerational epistemic obligations. Show why spatial lock-in creates unique epistemic duties.

## 6. Key Debates in the Literature

### Debate 1: Optimization vs. Robustness in Planning

**Optimization Position**: Traditional planning optimizes for most likely future scenario based on best available forecasts. This maximizes expected utility given current information.

**Robustness Position**: Robust planning (Lempert 2003; Buurman et al. 2025) trades optimal performance for reduced sensitivity to assumptions, planning for range of scenarios.

**Unresolved**: Is the choice between optimization and robustness merely technical, or does it implicate justice? WP3 will argue the latter.

### Debate 2: Local Knowledge vs. Expert Knowledge

**Professional Knowledge Position**: Planning requires technical expertise in engineering, economics, data science. Populist skepticism of expertise threatens rational planning (Saldert 2025).

**Local Knowledge Position**: Top-down technocratic planning systematically fails to account for local, contextual knowledge (Scott 1998; Fox & Margalit 2025).

**Unresolved**: How to integrate epistemic authority of professionals with legitimate claims of local knowledge without collapsing into either technocracy or populism? WP3's framework of hermeneutical rigidity suggests institutions can fail not by lacking technical expertise but by **refusing to update interpretative frameworks**.

### Debate 3: Presentism as Bias vs. Legitimate Democratic Preference

**Bias Position**: Thompson (2010) argues presentism is systematic democratic failure, requiring institutional corrections like trusteeship.

**Legitimacy Position**: Some argue that present generations legitimately prioritize their own interests; obligations to future are limited because we don't know their preferences (SEP 2021).

**Unresolved**: Does epistemic uncertainty about future preferences limit our obligations or intensify them? WP3 will argue the latter—epistemic uncertainty creates duty to preserve option value precisely because we cannot predict.

### Debate 4: Smart Cities as Progress vs. Technocratic Regression

**Progress Position**: Data-driven urbanism finally provides tools to manage urban complexity scientifically (smart city advocates).

**Regression Position**: Algorithmic urbanism replicates failed high modernist epistemology with new technological veneer (Kitchin 2021; Mattern 2021; Cook & Karvonen 2024).

**Unresolved**: Can algorithmic tools be used in epistemically humble ways, or do they inherently embody presentist optimization? WP3 will examine whether prediction-optimization frameworks can accommodate intergenerational epistemic justice.

---

## 7. Methodological Insights for WP3

The literature review suggests several methodological approaches:

### 7.1 Case Study Method

The German housing privatization provides a **natural experiment** in institutional epistemic failure. WP3 can use this as paradigmatic case for hermeneutical rigidity while acknowledging critiques of single-case generalization.

### 7.2 Conceptual Engineering

Several key concepts require development or refinement:
- **Hermeneutical rigidity** (building on Meyer 2023; Fricker 2007)
- **Intergenerational epistemic justice** (bridging Fricker and Thompson 2010)
- **Spatial non-fungibility** (extending Gosseries & Meyer 2022)
- **Epistemic humility calibrated to reversal costs** (building on Bleicher 2021)

### 7.3 Normative Argumentation from Multiple Foundations

WP3 can draw on:
- **Decision theory** (Lempert 2003; Hansson 2013) for option value
- **Virtue epistemology** (Lahroodi 2007; Meyer 2023) for institutional virtues/vices
- **Intergenerational justice** (Thompson 2010; Gosseries & Meyer 2022) for obligations
- **Critical planning theory** (Scott 1998; Rittel & Webber 1973) for institutional critique

### 7.4 Comparative Institutional Analysis

Vienna vs. Berlin/German privatization provides contrasting cases:
- **Vienna**: Preserved option value through public land ownership, avoided lock-in
- **Berlin**: Optimized for single scenario, exhibited hermeneutical rigidity, suffered epistemic failure

This comparison can illustrate practical implications of theoretical framework.

## 8. Conclusion: Positioning WP3's Novel Contribution

The state-of-the-art review reveals that while substantial scholarly work exists in epistemology of planning, intergenerational justice, and adaptive planning approaches, **no existing framework integrates these domains to address the specific epistemic challenges of planning non-fungible spatial goods for unknown future generations**.

WP3's core contribution will be developing a normative theory of **Intergenerational Epistemic Justice** arguing that:

1. **Hermeneutical rigidity** is a distinctive institutional epistemic vice particularly damaging for planning agencies
2. Epistemic humility required for spatial planning differs from that required for fungible assets
3. Unknown future preferences create obligation to **preserve option value** rather than optimize for projected scenarios
4. A just city is not one perfectly fitted to current values but one remaining **hospitable to future, rival conceptions of the good life**
5. The state has duty to act as **"resilient custodian"** rather than "master planner"

This framework provides normative foundation for practical planning approaches (scenario planning, mixed-use zoning, public land banking, modular infrastructure) that current literature justifies primarily on technical grounds.

The German housing privatization case demonstrates what happens when planning institutions violate intergenerational epistemic justice principles. The Vienna model demonstrates institutional epistemic virtue in practice.

**Research Positioning**: WP3 occupies the intersection of applied ethics (intergenerational justice), social epistemology (institutional epistemic virtues), and planning theory (adaptive approaches), providing philosophical foundations for approaches that existing literature recommends but inadequately justifies.
