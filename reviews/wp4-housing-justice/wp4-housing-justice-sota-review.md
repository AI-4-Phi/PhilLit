## Introduction: The Property-Owning Democracy Ideal and the Housing Contradiction

Property-owning democracy (POD) stands as one of contemporary political philosophy's most compelling visions of distributive justice. Rooted in John Rawls's later work and developed extensively by political philosophers over the past two decades (O'Neill and Williamson 2012; Thomas 2017; Freeman 2013), POD promises to achieve egalitarian aims not through ex post redistribution but through predistributive institutions that ensure the widespread dispersal of productive assets across the citizenry. Unlike welfare-state capitalism, which tolerates significant concentrations of wealth while ameliorating their worst effects through taxation and transfers, POD aims to prevent such concentrations from arising in the first place. The ideal holds particular appeal in an era of rising wealth inequality, offering a principled alternative that respects property rights while ensuring that ownership serves genuinely democratic ends.

Housing has emerged as a central site for applying POD ideals to concrete policy questions. If POD requires widespread asset ownership to secure citizens' economic independence and political equality, democratizing homeownership appears to be a natural and necessary component of this institutional framework. Recent philosophical work has explicitly extended POD principles to housing markets, arguing for limits on multiple property ownership (Erck 2024) and connecting POD to land value taxation as a mechanism for achieving fair property distribution (Kerr 2019). The intuition is straightforward: housing represents the most significant asset for most households, and homeownership appears to offer exactly the kind of economic security and civic stake that POD envisions.

Yet this straightforward application confronts a fundamental contradiction that existing philosophical and economic literatures have not adequately addressed. Housing is not simply another productive asset that can be widely distributed to achieve egalitarian ends. It is simultaneously a non-fungible consumption good, a positional good whose value depends on location and scarcity, and a financial asset whose role in welfare provision creates systematic tensions for democratic governance. This Work Package argues that these distinctive features of housing break the property-owning democracy framework in ways that demand not refinement of POD but a fundamental rethinking of housing justice.

The contradiction manifests most acutely in what we term the "double bind" of asset-based welfare: the state simultaneously needs housing to be affordable (low prices for access) and appreciating (high prices for asset-based welfare). Unlike productive capital, where broader ownership can increase overall productivity, housing exists in fundamentally fixed spatial relationships. Democratizing homeownership does not increase the housing stock proportionally; instead, it often entrenches positional inequalities and creates new forms of political economy that resist precisely the egalitarian aims POD seeks to achieve.

This literature review examines five interconnected domains of scholarship to demonstrate why housing demands moving beyond POD:

1. **Political Philosophy**: How POD theory developed and why its core assumptions fail for non-fungible positional goods
2. **Asset-Based Welfare**: The rise of homeownership-centered welfare states and their inherent contradictions
3. **Housing Financialization**: The transformation of housing into financial assets and the political economy this creates
4. **Tax Policy and Fiscal Neutrality**: How tax systems entrench homeownership bias and resist reform
5. **Land Rent Theory**: The social creation of land value and implications for justice

Our analysis reveals systematic gaps at the intersections of these literatures. Political philosophers advancing POD rarely engage with the specific economic features of housing that make it unsuitable for their framework. Housing economists document the failures of homeownership-based systems but lack normative frameworks for thinking about justice beyond markets. Tax policy analysts identify bias but cannot explain why reform proves politically impossible. Land theorists explain value creation but do not connect this to theories of democratic equality.

Work Package 4 addresses these gaps by demonstrating that housing justice requires decoupling welfare provision from housing markets. The contribution is not merely identifying homeownership's limits (well-documented empirically) but showing why these limits are systemic features that POD cannot overcome. The positional and non-fungible character of housing means that broad ownership entrenches rather than reduces inequality. The financial transformation of housing creates political economies resistant to egalitarian reform. And the social creation of land rent means private ownership captures publicly created value in ways that violate POD's own principles.

Before developing these claims through systematic literature review, three framing points deserve emphasis. First, our critique targets POD's application to housing specifically, not POD as a general framework for thinking about productive assets. Second, we engage charitably with POD's strongest formulations, showing that even under ideal theoretical conditions, housing breaks the framework. Third, our analysis connects philosophical debates about distributive justice to empirical political economy, demonstrating that normative and positive questions cannot be separated when evaluating institutional feasibility.

The review proceeds through six substantive sections before concluding with identified research gaps and WP4's specific contributions. Each section synthesizes a distinct literature while building toward the integrated argument that housing justice requires moving beyond property-owning democracy.

## Section 1: Property-Owning Democracy in Political Philosophy

### 1.1 Rawlsian Foundations and the POD Ideal

Property-owning democracy enters contemporary political philosophy through John Rawls's late work, particularly his distinction between five types of regime: laissez-faire capitalism, welfare-state capitalism, state socialism, liberal socialism, and property-owning democracy. Rawls argues that only the latter two can satisfy his principles of justice, with POD representing the private property path to a just basic structure. The foundational claim is that justice requires not merely redistributing wealth after markets generate inequality, but preventing large disparities from arising through predistributive institutions that ensure asset ownership is widely dispersed from the outset.

The edited volume by O'Neill and Williamson (2012) marks POD's emergence as a central topic in contemporary political philosophy. The volume establishes several key claims that subsequent literature builds upon. First, POD differs fundamentally from welfare-state capitalism not merely in degree but in kind—it represents an alternative form of social organization rather than a variant of existing capitalism (Jackson 2012). Second, POD aims to protect what Rawls termed "the fair value of political liberties," ensuring that concentrations of economic power cannot translate into disproportionate political influence (Freeman 2013). Third, POD connects to republican ideals of non-domination, where widespread ownership provides the material foundation for citizens to interact as equals (Thomas 2017).

Freeman (2013) provides the most systematic analysis of POD's relationship to Rawls's difference principle, arguing that wide dispersion of productive assets represents a necessary precondition for the difference principle to operate legitimately. If productive property concentrates in few hands, even redistributive taxation cannot prevent the wealthy from wielding disproportionate power over economic institutions. POD addresses this by ensuring that ownership itself is distributed in ways that prevent such concentration. Freeman emphasizes that this requires ongoing institutional maintenance—POD is not a one-time redistribution but a continuously operating system of background institutions that check tendencies toward concentration.

Thomas (2017) advances POD theory by connecting it explicitly to predistribution, the idea that justice requires shaping primary distributions rather than merely adjusting outcomes after markets operate. Thomas distinguishes predistribution from both laissez-faire capitalism (which accepts whatever distributions markets generate) and welfare-state capitalism (which corrects market distributions through taxation and transfers). Predistribution, by contrast, shapes the institutional framework within which markets operate to ensure that primary distributions already approximate just outcomes. For Thomas, POD represents the institutional realization of predistributive principles—a set of background rules ensuring that productive assets distribute widely rather than concentrate.

### 1.2 Mechanisms and Institutional Design

If POD represents a distinct regime type requiring specific institutional arrangements, what mechanisms achieve and maintain wide asset dispersion? The philosophical literature identifies several policy instruments while remaining somewhat underspecified about implementation details.

White (2015) examines universal asset grants—sometimes called "basic capital" or "stakeholder grants"—as a potential tool for achieving POD. The idea is straightforward: provide all citizens with a capital endowment at age of majority, giving everyone a material stake in productive property. White considers whether such grants genuinely advance egalitarian aims or merely provide windfall benefits to those already advantaged by family wealth and education. He concludes that basic capital can serve egalitarian purposes if grants are substantial enough to matter and if complementary institutions prevent rapid re-concentration of wealth. However, White acknowledges that basic capital alone cannot establish POD—it must combine with other predistributive mechanisms including progressive taxation, limits on intergenerational transfers, and policies promoting competitive markets.

Kerr (2019) develops connections between POD and land value taxation (LVT), arguing that taxing land rent represents a distinctly POD-compatible policy. Because land values arise from social investment in public goods rather than individual effort, taxing land rent captures socially created value for public purposes. Kerr argues this prevents landowners from monopolizing returns on public investment while promoting productive use of land. The link to POD is twofold: LVT helps fund universal asset grants or other predistributive programs, and it prevents wealth concentration through land speculation. However, Kerr's analysis focuses primarily on productive land uses and does not fully engage with housing's distinctive features as both location-specific consumption good and financial asset.

Malleson (2014) offers a socialist critique, arguing that any genuine POD must extend to workplace democracy. For Malleson, dispersing ownership of financial assets or even small businesses proves insufficient if productive enterprises remain organized as hierarchical firms where owners command and workers obey. True property-owning democracy would require workers to own and democratically control the enterprises they work in. Malleson's critique raises important questions about what "property ownership" means in POD—is it primarily about distributing financial claims on productive assets, or does it require transforming property relations themselves? This ambiguity matters for thinking about housing: does POD require merely that households own their residences, or does it demand democratic control over housing provision?

Raekstad (2018) pushes this critique further, questioning whether POD genuinely transcends capitalism or merely represents capitalism with redistribution. If POD retains market allocation of goods and services, wage labor as the primary income source, and production for profit, then it remains capitalist regardless of how ownership distributes. Raekstad argues that POD risks being either insufficient (if it merely spreads ownership of financial assets) or unstable (if it tries to transform property relations while retaining market coordination). The challenge he identifies applies with particular force to housing: markets for positional goods with substantial externalities may not achieve just outcomes even with dispersed ownership.

### 1.3 Housing Applications and Limitarianism

Recent philosophical work has begun applying POD principles specifically to housing, though this literature remains nascent. Erck (2024) develops "housing limitarianism," arguing that there exist upper limits on justifiable housing wealth—amounts beyond which additional housing ownership becomes morally impermissible. Drawing on limitarian principles that set upper bounds on permissible wealth, Erck argues that excess housing ownership violates both sufficiency requirements (when some lack adequate shelter, others should not hoard housing) and democratic equality (excessive housing wealth enables domination and political influence).

Erck's argument proceeds in three steps. First, she establishes that housing differs from ordinary consumer goods because supply is substantially fixed and location-specific—excess housing consumption directly prevents others from accessing similar positional benefits. Second, she connects housing to Rawls's "social bases of self-respect," arguing that adequate housing is necessary for citizens to view themselves and be viewed by others as equals. Third, she argues that limiting excess housing ownership advances POD aims by ensuring housing wealth distributes more widely. Erck proposes policies limiting individuals and corporations to owning a maximum number of properties, with violations resulting in compulsory purchase.

While Erck's analysis represents important progress in connecting POD theory to housing specifically, it retains POD's basic framework: the goal remains democratizing homeownership, merely with upper limits to prevent hoarding. This approach does not engage with deeper tensions we identify. Even with perfect distribution of homeownership at appropriate scales, housing's positional character means that location-based inequalities persist. The non-fungibility of housing means that owning property in declining regions offers fundamentally different benefits from ownership in prosperous ones. And the financialization of housing creates political economies where homeowner majorities resist precisely the policies (increased supply, price stabilization) that justice might require.

### 1.4 Defenses of Welfare-State Capitalism

Not all political philosophers embrace POD. Von Platz (2020) offers the most systematic recent defense of welfare-state capitalism against POD advocates. Von Platz argues that POD proponents exaggerate the differences between the two regimes and understate welfare-state capitalism's egalitarian potential. He claims that robust progressive taxation combined with generous social insurance can achieve distributive justice without requiring the extensive predistributive apparatus POD demands.

Von Platz's key argument concerns political economy: POD assumes that predistributive institutions can be maintained through democratic politics, but he questions whether dispersed asset ownership genuinely prevents wealth from translating into political power. If anything, von Platz suggests, welfare-state capitalism's greater transparency about redistribution may be more compatible with democratic accountability than POD's complex predistributive mechanisms. His argument gains force when applied to housing specifically. The political economy of homeowner democracies (discussed in Section 3) suggests that dispersed housing ownership creates powerful constituencies resisting affordable housing policy—exactly the opposite of POD's intended effect.

This debate between POD advocates and welfare-state defenders remains substantially philosophical, with limited engagement with empirical political economy. The housing case offers a crucial test: if POD institutions work anywhere, housing—the largest asset for most families—should be a central success story. Yet as subsequent sections demonstrate, countries with high homeownership rates exhibit political economies systematically resistant to egalitarian housing policy. This suggests either that actual "property-owning democracies" have not implemented POD correctly (a theoretical move that makes POD unfalsifiable) or that something about housing breaks POD's logic.

### 1.5 Critical Assessment: What POD Theory Assumes About Assets

The philosophical POD literature shares several assumptions that prove problematic for housing. First, it tends to treat assets as generally fungible—ownership of productive property provides economic security and independence regardless of which specific assets one owns. But housing is irreducibly location-specific. Owning a home in Detroit provides fundamentally different economic benefits from owning one in San Francisco. POD theory lacks conceptual resources for addressing systematic spatial inequalities that ownership itself cannot overcome.

Second, POD literature assumes that broader ownership of productive assets increases overall productivity or at least does not reduce it. Wide dispersion of capital ownership might promote competition, innovation, and efficient allocation. But housing supply is substantially inelastic, particularly in desirable locations. Democratizing homeownership does not proportionally increase housing stock; instead, it changes who captures the value of existing positional goods. POD theory needs an account of justice for inherently scarce positional goods that its productive-asset framework cannot provide.

Third, POD theory focuses primarily on preventing domination and protecting political equality. It is less concerned with absolute living standards except as they affect relative standing and political participation. But housing affects welfare directly through consumption value. A person may own their home outright (satisfying POD ideals of economic independence) while living in a dangerous neighborhood with poor schools and limited job access. POD's focus on ownership relations obscures questions about spatial inequality and access to location-specific public goods.

Fourth, the POD literature undertheorizes intergenerational dynamics. Most discussions focus on institutions that maintain asset dispersion within a generation, treating inheritance and intergenerational transfers as secondary concerns. But housing wealth concentrates across generations precisely through homeownership. Parents who bought homes decades ago in now-valuable locations can transfer enormous wealth to their children, while those whose parents rented transfer nothing. Even perfect intragenerational homeownership equality generates intergenerational inequality if housing values appreciate differentially across space.

Finally, POD theory assumes that widely dispersed ownership creates constituencies for policies that maintain egalitarian distributions. Freeman (2013) argues that when most citizens own productive assets, they will support institutions preventing wealth concentration. But housing provides a counterexample: broad homeownership creates powerful constituencies opposing precisely the policies (abundant supply, price stabilization) that would maintain affordability for non-owners. The political economy of homeowner democracy contradicts POD's assumptions about how ownership shapes political preferences.

These limitations are not merely empirical complications that ideal theory can bracket. They reflect fundamental tensions between POD's conceptual framework and housing's distinctive economic and social features. Property-owning democracy theory developed to think about productive assets, where broader ownership can enhance efficiency and democratic inclusion. Housing, as a positional consumption good transformed into a financial asset, breaks this logic in ways that demand different normative frameworks.

The next section turns to political economy, examining how asset-based welfare regimes have actually developed and the contradictions they generate. This empirical literature confirms that the tensions identified philosophically are not merely theoretical but manifest in systematic policy failures across developed democracies.

## Section 2: The Rise of Asset-Based Welfare

### 2.1 From Social Insurance to Asset-Based Security

The past four decades have witnessed a fundamental transformation in how advanced capitalist democracies structure welfare provision. Where post-war welfare states emphasized social insurance—collective risk-pooling through taxation and public provision—contemporary policy increasingly emphasizes individual asset ownership as the foundation for economic security (Doling and Ronald 2010). Housing stands at the center of this transformation. Homeownership has evolved from a consumption choice into a central pillar of household welfare strategy, expected to provide not merely shelter but retirement security, healthcare funding, and intergenerational wealth transfer.

Doling and Ronald (2010) identify asset-based welfare as a distinct policy paradigm emerging from the retrenchment of traditional welfare states. Rather than expanding public pensions, unemployment insurance, or social housing, governments increasingly promote homeownership as the primary mechanism through which households build economic security. The logic appears straightforward: property ownership provides both use value (shelter) and exchange value (appreciating asset), allowing households to accumulate wealth that can be accessed through sale, remortgaging, or bequest. Asset-based welfare thus promises to reduce public expenditure while enhancing individual responsibility and economic participation.

The concept connects to broader shifts in political economy. Where Keynesian welfare states managed demand through fiscal policy and social spending, neoliberal governance emphasizes supply-side reforms and privatization. Asset-based welfare fits this template by shifting responsibility for social reproduction from collective institutions to individual households. Citizens are reconstituted as investor-subjects whose welfare depends on successful asset accumulation and management (Adkins, Cooper, and Konings 2020). Housing becomes the paradigmatic asset for this new welfare logic—widely accessible (through mortgage finance), politically popular (homeownership as achievement), and apparently self-sustaining (appreciation funds future security).

### 2.2 The Homeownership-Welfare Tradeoff

Jim Kemeny's comparative research (1981, 1995, 2001, 2005) establishes a foundational insight: countries with high homeownership rates typically have less generous welfare states. This "really big tradeoff" operates through several mechanisms. First, homeownership reduces political support for collective welfare provision. Homeowners have material interests in low property taxes and limited public spending on social housing. Their welfare depends on housing appreciation rather than public services, creating constituencies opposing redistributive policies.

Second, housing debt crowds out welfare spending. In high-homeownership countries, substantial household income flows to mortgage payments rather than taxation. This reduces fiscal capacity for public welfare while creating political resistance to tax increases—heavily mortgaged households cannot afford additional burdens. Third, homeownership shapes attitudes about economic security. Where welfare states socialize risk through collective insurance, homeownership individualizes it. Households sink savings into property and depend on price appreciation for future security, fostering ideological commitments to market solutions and individual responsibility.

Kemeny (1995, 2001) distinguishes "unitary" rental markets (where social and private rental compete, promoting tenure neutrality) from "dualist" systems (where social housing serves residual populations while homeownership and private rental dominate). Dualist systems correlate with high homeownership rates and thinner welfare provision. The causal direction runs both ways: weak welfare states promote homeownership as alternative security mechanism, while high homeownership rates erode political support for welfare expansion. This creates path dependence—once established, high-homeownership regimes resist movement toward either tenure neutrality or expanded welfare provision.

Schwartz (2012) extends this analysis through the 2008 financial crisis, examining how housing-based welfare models contributed to the crash and shaped post-crisis politics. Countries with high household debt and homeownership-centered welfare (US, UK, Ireland, Spain) experienced severe crises when housing bubbles collapsed. Yet rather than prompting fundamental reform, the crisis reinforced homeownership ideology. Governments prioritized restoring housing markets and access to mortgage credit, treating the crisis as a financial aberration rather than a systemic failure of asset-based welfare. This response reflects homeowner constituencies' political power—governments cannot allow widespread foreclosure without risking electoral backlash.

### 2.3 Privatized Keynesianism and the Debt Solution

Crouch (2009) introduces the concept of "privatized Keynesianism" to explain how governments maintained demand amid welfare retrenchment and wage stagnation. Where Keynesian welfare states managed demand through public spending, privatized Keynesianism operates through household debt, particularly mortgage borrowing. As real wages stagnated from the 1970s onward, household consumption increasingly relied on credit rather than income growth. Housing equity extraction—remortgaging to access appreciation—became a key mechanism for funding consumption, education, and healthcare.

This model depends critically on sustained house price appreciation. If prices rise, households can borrow against equity to maintain living standards despite stagnant wages. Financial innovation—subprime mortgages, interest-only loans, cash-out refinancing—expanded access to housing debt, effectively privatizing the counter-cyclical spending traditionally performed by government. The result was consumption-driven growth without fiscal expansion, politically appealing to neoliberal governments committed to low taxation and welfare retrenchment.

But privatized Keynesianism contains fundamental contradictions. It requires permanently rising house prices, which means housing must become increasingly unaffordable for new entrants. The system creates intergenerational inequity: early homebuyers accumulate wealth through appreciation while later cohorts face escalating prices and debt burdens (Forrest and Hirayama 2017). Eventually, prices outpace incomes to the point where even generous mortgage terms cannot sustain demand. The model is inherently unstable, depending on continually inflating a bubble that must eventually burst.

Fuller (2020) documents Britain's evolution toward an "asset-shaped welfare state" where housing equity replaced public provision as the primary source of economic security. Fuller shows how governments explicitly promoted mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) as a substitute for welfare spending. Housing appreciation effectively provided private unemployment insurance (households could remortgage during jobless spells), retirement income (downsizing or equity release), and healthcare funding. The state withdrew from direct provision while subsidizing mortgage lending through tax policy and financial regulation.

The 2008 crisis exposed this model's fragility. When prices fell, households lost not merely wealth but their primary welfare safety net. Negative equity trapped homeowners in properties they could not sell. Mortgage defaults threatened the financial system. Governments responded with massive bailouts—socializing losses while maintaining privatized welfare structures. The crisis revealed that asset-based welfare had not reduced public expenditure but merely shifted it to emergency bank rescues and housing market supports.

### 2.4 The Asset Economy and New Forms of Inequality

Adkins, Cooper, and Konings (2020) argue that contemporary capitalism has transitioned from an industrial wage economy to an "asset economy" where wealth derives primarily from ownership of appreciating assets rather than labor income. Housing stands as the paradigmatic asset, with property ownership increasingly determining economic life chances. The authors identify a fundamental shift in inequality structure: the salient divide is no longer between labor and capital but between asset-owners and non-owners.

This transformation restructures inequality in several ways. First, it is intergenerational: younger cohorts face escalating asset prices and depend on parental wealth transfers to access ownership. Second, it is temporal: the timing of asset purchase matters enormously, with those who bought property decades ago accumulating wealth through appreciation unavailable to current buyers paying inflated prices. Third, it is spatial: asset value depends on location, with property in global cities appreciating far more than identical houses in declining regions.

The asset economy creates new forms of stratification that traditional class analysis struggles to capture. A teacher who inherited a London flat may have greater lifetime wealth than a well-paid professional buying property now. Siblings who purchased homes in different cities face divergent economic trajectories despite similar initial advantages. Timing and geography matter as much as income or occupation. These forms of inequality resist traditional redistributive policies focused on income taxation—the wealth accumulates through appreciation captured by ownership rather than taxable income.

Forrest and Hirayama (2017) examine these dynamics in East Asian context, documenting how housing wealth inequality compounds intergenerational divides. In Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, earlier cohorts achieved homeownership when prices were moderate, accumulating substantial equity. Later cohorts face prices that require both high incomes and parental support. The result is "asset-based stratification" where family wealth determines housing access more than individual achievement. This violates meritocratic principles and creates dynasties of advantage based on property ownership timing.

Ronald and Kadi (2018) analyze Britain's emergence as a "post-homeownership society" where declining ownership rates among younger cohorts coincide with the rise of private landlordism. Unable to afford homeownership, younger households rent from landlords who are often older property owners leveraging accumulated equity to buy additional properties. This creates a rentier dynamic: wealth transfers from asset-poor renters to asset-rich landlords, amplifying inequality over time. The "generation rent" phenomenon reflects not merely housing affordability problems but a systematic transfer of wealth from young to old, from asset-poor to asset-rich.

### 2.5 The Double Bind of Asset-Based Welfare

The asset-based welfare literature reveals a fundamental contradiction: the state needs housing prices to be both low (for affordability and access) and high (for asset-based security to function). This double bind pervades housing policy in high-homeownership countries. Governments must maintain homeowner wealth while ensuring new entrants can access ownership. They must prevent price crashes (protecting existing owners) while preventing excessive appreciation (preserving affordability). They must subsidize mortgage lending (facilitating access) while preventing dangerous leverage (ensuring financial stability).

This tension admits no stable resolution. Policies that enhance affordability—increasing supply, restricting mortgage lending, removing tax subsidies—threaten homeowner wealth and provoke political resistance. Policies that protect homeowner wealth—restricting supply, supporting prices, subsidizing mortgages—worsen affordability for non-owners. Governments oscillate between these imperatives, typically prioritizing homeowner interests (larger, more politically active constituency) while offering marginal programs for first-time buyers that do not fundamentally address the problem.

The double bind reflects housing's simultaneous roles as consumption good and investment asset. No other major welfare domain faces this contradiction. Health insurance need not appreciate to provide security. Pension funds ideally grow but need not if funded through taxation. But asset-based housing welfare requires appreciation to function—without it, homeownership provides shelter but not wealth accumulation, retirement funding, or intergenerational transfers. Yet appreciation necessarily means unaffordability for those not yet owning.

Fuller (2019) examines this tension comparatively, showing how different countries navigate the contradiction through distinct institutional arrangements. Some (Denmark, Netherlands) use rental sector policies to buffer conflicts between homeowner wealth and affordability. Others (Australia, Canada) accept escalating prices while offering targeted support for first-time buyers. Still others (Germany, Switzerland) maintain lower homeownership rates and more robust rental sectors. But no high-homeownership country has resolved the fundamental tension—all exhibit some combination of affordability crises, intergenerational inequality, household debt burdens, and political conflict over housing policy.

### 2.6 Critical Assessment: Asset-Based Welfare's Contradictions

The asset-based welfare literature establishes several key findings relevant to housing justice and POD. First, homeownership-centered welfare systems generate systematic political economy effects resisting egalitarian reform. Broad homeownership creates constituencies opposing policies (supply expansion, price stabilization) that justice might require. This contradicts POD's assumption that dispersed ownership creates support for equality-preserving institutions.

Second, asset-based welfare transforms housing from a consumption good meeting needs into a financial asset requiring appreciation. This financialization (examined in detail in Section 3) creates dependencies on price growth that conflict with affordability and access. Housing cannot simultaneously be an affordable consumption good and a wealth-accumulating asset—yet asset-based welfare requires both.

Third, housing wealth inequality compounds intergenerationally in ways that resist standard redistributive policies. The value accumulates through appreciation rather than taxable income. Wealth transfers through inheritance and family support. Geographic disparities mean identical properties yield different returns. These features make housing wealth inequality particularly persistent and difficult to address through conventional welfare policies.

Fourth, the empirical literature documents that high homeownership rates correlate with less generous welfare states, greater inequality, and higher household debt. This suggests that democratizing homeownership does not advance egalitarian aims but instead shifts inequality to new domains while weakening collective provision. POD's aspiration to widely disperse property ownership may achieve the former while undermining broader egalitarian goals.

Finally, the asset-based welfare literature highlights the instability of systems depending on sustained asset appreciation. These models require permanent bubbles—housing prices growing faster than incomes indefinitely. When bubbles burst, as in 2008, the welfare consequences are severe. Asset-based welfare privatizes security during booms but socializes risk during crashes, combining the worst features of market and state provision.

These findings pose serious challenges for POD applied to housing. If democratizing homeownership creates political economies resistant to egalitarian policy, undermines collective welfare provision, requires unsustainable price appreciation, and generates new forms of inequality, then widespread housing ownership fails to advance POD's aims. The next section examines housing financialization in detail, showing how the transformation of housing into financial assets creates systematic obstacles to housing justice.

## Section 3: Housing Financialization and Political Economy

### 3.1 The Transformation of Housing into Financial Assets

The past four decades have witnessed housing's transformation from primarily a use-value consumption good into a financial asset class integrated with global capital markets. Aalbers (2016) defines housing financialization as "the increasing dominance of financial actors, markets, practices, measurements and narratives, at various scales, resulting in a structural transformation of economies, firms (including financial institutions), states and households." For housing, this means that investment returns increasingly drive decisions about production, allocation, and consumption, displacing traditional concerns with shelter provision and community stability.

Christophers (2020) situates housing financialization within the broader rise of "rentier capitalism"—economic systems where wealth accumulation occurs primarily through rent extraction rather than productive investment. Housing represents the paradigmatic rentier asset: it generates income streams (rents or imputed rents) while appreciating in value, with minimal productive contribution. Land scarcity and planning restrictions create artificial supply constraints that enable sustained rent extraction. Financial innovation allows these income streams to be securitized, creating investment vehicles that attract global capital seeking stable returns.

The transformation involves several interconnected processes. First, housing increasingly serves as a store of value and inflation hedge rather than merely providing shelter. Investors—from individual landlords to institutional funds—view property as a financial asset comparable to stocks or bonds, evaluating returns through yield calculations rather than use value. Second, mortgage markets have become integrated with global capital markets through securitization. Mortgages are no longer held by local banks but packaged into securities traded globally, connecting housing finance to worldwide capital flows. Third, new actors—private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds—have entered housing markets, treating residential property as an asset class within diversified portfolios (Christophers 2023).

Rolnik (2019) examines these dynamics from a global perspective, documenting how financialization has transformed housing in both Global North and South. She argues that housing has become a "frontier" for financial accumulation, with capital seeking returns from rent extraction on a planetary scale. Rolnik connects financialization to human rights, showing how the transformation of housing into financial assets systematically undermines housing as a social right. When investment returns drive housing provision, affordability and access become secondary concerns subordinated to yield optimization.

### 3.2 Tax Subsidies and the Hidden Homeownership Welfare State

Housing financialization did not emerge spontaneously from market dynamics but was actively constructed through state policy, particularly taxation. Kholodilin et al. (2022) provide comprehensive documentation of the "hidden homeownership welfare state"—the extensive tax subsidies that privilege owner-occupation across OECD countries. These subsidies take multiple forms: mortgage interest deductions, exemptions from capital gains taxation, non-taxation of imputed rental income, and property tax rates below market levels.

The scale of these subsidies rivals explicit social spending. In many countries, foregone revenue from homeownership tax preferences exceeds spending on social housing and rental assistance combined. Yet unlike direct welfare spending, these subsidies remain largely invisible in public budgets, presented as normal tax treatment rather than government expenditure. This fiscal illusion allows homeownership subsidies to escape the political scrutiny applied to explicit welfare programs.

Poterba (1984) established that tax subsidies capitalize into house prices rather than increasing homeownership rates—they make buying more expensive rather than more accessible. The incidence falls on sellers (who capture subsidy value through higher prices) rather than buyers (who pay inflated prices even with tax benefits). Hilber and Turner (2014) confirm this empirically for mortgage interest deductions, finding that subsidies increase prices in supply-constrained markets without significantly affecting ownership rates. The policy succeeds in channeling wealth to existing homeowners but fails to expand access.

The political economy of these subsidies reveals housing financialization's power. Mortgage interest deductions are among the most regressive tax expenditures—benefits flow disproportionately to high-income households with large mortgages and high marginal tax rates. Yet reform proposals consistently fail politically. Ambrose et al. (2022) examine the 2017 US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which capped mortgage interest deductions. Even this modest reform (which increased the standard deduction, making itemization less attractive) provoked substantial opposition and applied only to new mortgages, protecting existing homeowners.

### 3.3 The Political Economy of Homeowner Democracies

Financialized housing creates distinctive political economies that resist egalitarian reform. When homeownership becomes the primary asset for median households, and when housing wealth depends on sustained appreciation, homeowners become a formidable political constituency opposing policies that might stabilize or reduce prices. This dynamic transforms democratic politics in ways POD theory does not anticipate.

Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) document how land-use regulations serve homeowner interests by restricting supply and maintaining scarcity rents. In supply-constrained markets, the "regulatory tax"—the gap between construction costs and prices—can exceed 50% of property values. These artificial constraints benefit existing owners at the expense of potential entrants.

The political economy extends beyond local land-use politics. Homeowner constituencies shape national policy across multiple domains. They oppose policies that might increase supply (planning reform, social housing construction) or stabilize prices (macroprudential regulation of mortgage lending, changes to tax treatment). They support policies that inflate prices (mortgage subsidies, first-time buyer programs that increase demand without addressing supply). The result is a systematic bias toward policies that worsen affordability while protecting existing owner wealth.

Ryan-Collins (2018) analyzes how mortgage credit expansion drives price appreciation by allowing buyers to bid more for limited housing stock. In a supply-constrained market, easier credit translates into higher prices rather than increased ownership. Yet governments consistently loosen mortgage lending standards to maintain homebuyer demand, even after experiencing crises triggered by excessive leverage. This reflects homeowner political economy: governments fear price corrections more than affordability crises because homeowners vote and organize while aspiring buyers are diffuse and politically weak.

### 3.4 Institutional Investors and the New Rental Economy

Recent years have seen the emergence of corporate landlordism as institutional investors purchase single-family homes and apartment buildings at scale. Christophers (2023) documents how asset managers now control substantial residential property portfolios, treating housing as a financial asset within diversified investment funds. Fields (2022) examines how digital technologies enable "automated landlords" to manage large portfolios efficiently, using algorithms to optimize rents and minimize costs.

This development represents a qualitative shift in housing provision. Where traditional landlords were often individuals managing a few properties, institutional investors operate at scale with sophisticated financial engineering. They use leverage to amplify returns, securitize rental income streams, and optimize portfolios through data-driven management. Gabor and Kohl (2022) examine European cases, showing how "my home has become an asset class" for pension funds and insurance companies seeking stable returns in low-interest environments.

Institutional landlordism challenges traditional narratives about homeownership and inequality. If housing serves primarily as a financial asset, then the relevant question is not ownership per se but who captures the returns on housing investment. Institutional ownership might actually distribute returns more broadly than individual ownership if pension funds and insurance companies hold housing assets. Yet the empirical record suggests institutional landlordism concentrates wealth while reducing tenant security. Corporate landlords are more likely to evict, less responsive to maintenance requests, and more aggressive in rent increases than individual landlords.

Moreover, institutional ownership transforms housing's political economy. Corporate landlords are organized economic actors with resources to lobby effectively. They oppose rent regulation, tenant protections, and policies that might reduce returns. Compared to diffuse individual homeowners, institutional investors may actually be more effective at blocking egalitarian housing reform while extracting larger portions of household income as rent.

### 3.5 The Double Bind Revisited: Asset Appreciation vs. Affordability

Financialized housing makes the double bind identified in Section 2 even more acute. When housing serves primarily as a financial asset, stakeholders depend on appreciation not merely for household welfare but for pension fund returns, bank balance sheets, and macroeconomic stability. This creates systematic resistance to policies that would stabilize prices or increase affordability.

Ryan-Collins et al. (2017) analyze this tension through land economics, showing how credit-fueled demand for fixed land supply drives prices above construction costs. The result is escalating land values that represent neither productive investment nor improved housing stock—purely positional rent. In their framework, housing affordability crises reflect the capture of location-specific rents by private landowners rather than market failures that policy might correct. This means that addressing affordability requires confronting the interests of those capturing rent, which financialization makes increasingly difficult.

Ryan-Collins (2021) proposes "breaking the housing-finance cycle" through macroprudential regulation that limits mortgage lending relative to incomes. By constraining credit, such policies could moderate price appreciation and improve affordability. But implementing this faces the double bind: credit restrictions would reduce housing demand, lowering prices and undermining asset-based welfare for existing owners. Governments face a political impossible—sustaining the system requires inflating bubbles, but bubbles eventually burst with severe welfare consequences.

Madden and Marcuse (2016) argue for de-commodification as the solution—removing housing from market allocation entirely through expanded social housing. If housing is a social right rather than a commodity, then appreciation becomes irrelevant and the double bind dissolves. But achieving de-commodification faces overwhelming political obstacles in contexts where homeowners are the median voter and housing wealth constitutes most household assets. Financialization creates entrenched interests defending commodified housing regardless of welfare costs.

### 3.6 Critical Assessment: Financialization and Housing Justice

The financialization literature reveals how housing has been actively transformed from a consumption good into a financial asset through state policy, particularly taxation and financial regulation. This transformation was not inevitable but reflected political choices that privileged homeowner wealth accumulation over affordability and access. The result is a political economy where homeowner and investor interests systematically block egalitarian reform.

Several implications for POD emerge. First, democratizing homeownership in a financialized context does not disperse power but creates a constituency defending financialized housing against reform. Broad ownership produces "homevoter" politics that prioritizes property values over housing access. Second, tax subsidies that capitalize into prices transfer wealth to existing owners rather than expanding ownership, contradicting POD's aims. Third, institutional investors demonstrate that ownership form matters less than market structure—housing organized as financial assets generates inequality regardless of whether individuals or institutions own.

Fourth, the double bind between asset appreciation and affordability admits no resolution within market frameworks. Asset-based welfare requires appreciation; affordability requires price stability or decline. These goals are incompatible, yet financialized systems depend on both. POD offers no mechanism for escaping this contradiction—dispersed ownership does not resolve the underlying tension between housing as consumption good and investment asset.

Finally, financialization creates path dependencies that resist institutional change. Once housing wealth becomes central to household welfare, pension fund returns, and financial system stability, governments cannot permit significant price corrections without severe economic and political consequences. This locks in a system whose internal logic contradicts egalitarian aims. The next section examines tax policy in detail, showing how fiscal structures entrench homeownership bias and resist reform despite recognized inefficiencies.

## Section 4: Fiscal Neutrality and Tax Policy

### 4.1 The Fiscal Bias Toward Homeownership

Jim Kemeny's early work (1981) introduced "fiscal neutrality" as a normative principle: tax and subsidy systems should not favor one housing tenure over others. Neutral treatment would allow households to choose between owning and renting based on genuine preferences and circumstances rather than artificial incentives. Yet virtually all OECD countries violate fiscal neutrality, providing substantial advantages to homeownership through tax treatment.

The OECD (2022) comprehensively documents these biases across member countries. The most common distortions include: (1) non-taxation of imputed rental income (the implicit rent homeowners pay themselves), (2) mortgage interest deductibility, (3) exemption of primary residences from capital gains taxation, and (4) property taxes below the capitalized value of public services. Individually, each distortion provides modest advantages; collectively, they create powerful incentives toward ownership regardless of household circumstances or market conditions.

The economic case against these subsidies is straightforward. First, they misallocate capital by channeling investment toward housing rather than productive sectors. Second, they capitalize into prices, making housing more expensive without increasing supply. Third, they are regressive, providing largest benefits to high-income households. Fourth, they reduce labor mobility by increasing ownership's transaction costs. Fifth, they complicate macroeconomic management by tying household wealth to housing markets prone to boom-bust cycles.

Yet despite consensus among economists that these subsidies are inefficient and inequitable, reform proves extraordinarily difficult politically. This puzzle reveals housing's distinctive political economy. The subsidies create constituencies—homeowners—who oppose reform even though it would improve aggregate welfare. Politicians fear homeowner backlash more than they value economic efficiency or equity. The result is policy persistence despite recognized failures.

### 4.2 Imputed Rent and the Fundamental Tax Distortion

The non-taxation of imputed rental income represents the largest and least visible homeownership subsidy. Economic logic treats homeownership as self-rental: owners provide housing services to themselves and should be taxed on this income just as landlords are taxed on rental receipts. Failure to tax imputed rent creates a substantial advantage for ownership over renting, since renters pay rent from after-tax income while implicit owner-rent escapes taxation.

Figari et al. (2017) analyze the distributional effects of including imputed rent in taxable income across European countries. They find that current tax treatment benefits high-income homeowners dramatically, with subsidy values reaching tens of thousands of euros annually for expensive properties. Including imputed rent in taxation would make tax systems substantially more progressive while removing distortions favoring ownership.

Yet no OECD country currently taxes imputed rent (though several did historically). The practical challenges are real: valuing imputed rent requires assessment of market rents for owner-occupied properties, which is administratively complex. Owners might face liquidity constraints if taxed on imputed income they do not receive in cash. These implementation challenges, however, cannot fully explain policy resistance—countries successfully administer complex tax systems in other domains.

The political explanation is more compelling: taxing imputed rent would significantly reduce homeowner wealth by lowering the after-tax return on housing investment. In financialized housing systems where median household wealth depends on property appreciation, such reform threatens middle-class welfare. Politicians view the policy as politically suicidal regardless of economic merits. This illustrates how financialization creates lock-in: once housing becomes the primary household asset, reforms that reduce returns become infeasible politically even when they serve broader egalitarian goals.

### 4.3 Mortgage Interest Deductibility and Price Capitalization

Mortgage interest deductions represent the most visible homeownership subsidy, allowing owners to deduct interest payments from taxable income. The stated rationale is enhancing affordability by reducing ownership costs. But economic analysis demonstrates that in supply-constrained markets, subsidies capitalize into prices—they make buying more expensive rather than more accessible.

Hilber and Turner (2014) provide rigorous empirical confirmation. They exploit geographic variation in subsidy value (which depends on state/local tax deductibility and price levels) combined with differences in housing supply elasticity. In areas with elastic supply (where construction can readily expand), mortgage interest deductions modestly increase homeownership rates without much affecting prices—additional buyers trigger additional construction. But in supply-constrained areas (where geography or regulation limits construction), subsidies increase prices without expanding ownership. The incidence falls entirely on sellers through higher prices.

This finding has profound implications. Mortgage interest deductions transfer wealth from buyers to sellers without expanding access—precisely the opposite of stated policy goals. The subsidy amounts to a massive wealth transfer to existing homeowners financed through foregone tax revenue. Yet reform remains politically difficult because current owners benefit from capitalized subsidy values. Removing deductions would reduce the prices new buyers pay but also reduce the selling prices existing owners receive.

The 2017 US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped mortgage interest deductions at $750,000 (down from $1 million) and increased the standard deduction, making itemization less attractive. Ambrose et al. (2022) analyze these reforms' effects, finding modest price impacts concentrated in high-cost areas where itemization remained valuable. The reforms faced significant opposition despite affecting primarily affluent households. That even marginal reforms targeting the wealthy provoke resistance illustrates homeownership subsidies' political entrenchment.

### 4.4 Capital Gains Exemptions and Intergenerational Inequality

Most countries exempt primary residences from capital gains taxation when sold, or provide large exemptions ($250,000-$500,000 in the US). The rationale combines several claims: avoiding taxation of inflation-driven gains, reducing mobility barriers from transaction taxes, and protecting middle-class wealth from erosion. But these exemptions create substantial inequities and inefficiencies.

First, gains exemptions encourage housing investment over other asset classes. A household can accumulate hundreds of thousands in untaxed housing wealth but faces taxation on equivalent stock market gains. This tilts portfolios toward housing, reducing capital available for productive investment. Second, exemptions disproportionately benefit those who purchased property when prices were moderate, accumulating large untaxed gains. Late buyers in expensive markets face high prices but limited appreciation potential, creating intergenerational inequity. Third, exemptions encourage over-investment in housing—households pour resources into home improvements because returns escape taxation.

From a justice perspective, capital gains exemptions violate horizontal equity: they tax labor income while exempting capital income from housing appreciation. A doctor earning $300,000 annually pays substantial income tax; a retiree with modest pension but $500,000 in housing appreciation pays nothing on that gain. The exemption transforms housing into a tax-advantaged wealth accumulation vehicle unavailable to renters, amplifying inequality between owners and non-owners.

Yet eliminating exemptions faces fierce resistance. Homeowners view untaxed appreciation as an earned benefit, not a subsidy. Politicians cannot easily explain why someone selling their long-time home should pay taxes on gains they perceive as life savings rather than investment returns. The political challenge reveals again how financialization changes housing's political economy: treating appreciation as taxable investment income contradicts popular understanding of homeownership as shelter provision rather than financial investment.

### 4.5 Property Taxation and the Under-Taxation of Land

Property taxes represent the primary ongoing taxation of housing wealth, but rates generally fall well below the capitalized value of location-specific public goods. Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) document "regulatory taxes"—gaps between construction costs and prices arising from supply constraints—that often exceed 50% in high-demand areas. These gaps represent location rents that public investment and agglomeration economies create, yet property taxes capture only a fraction of this value.

The under-taxation reflects political economy. Property taxes are visible, salient, and painful for households on fixed incomes even if they are wealthy in housing equity. Tax revolts (like California's Proposition 13) have capped property tax rates and increases in many jurisdictions. The result is systematic under-taxation of property wealth compared to income or consumption, creating horizontal inequity between those whose wealth is in housing vs. other forms.

Moreover, property taxes typically do not distinguish land value from structure value, taxing both at the same rate. This creates inefficiencies: land is fixed in supply, so taxing it cannot reduce quantity (making land taxes efficient). Structures represent productive investment that responds to incentives—taxing structures discourages development. Optimal tax policy would heavily tax land while exempting or lightly taxing structures, but few jurisdictions implement such "split-rate" taxation (Yang and Hawley 2022).

The under-taxation and poor design of property taxes entrench homeownership advantages. Owners pay taxes well below the value they receive from location-specific public goods (schools, infrastructure, public safety). This subsidy capitalizes into prices, making homeownership even more attractive and expensive. Reform faces obstacles from homeowner resistance to tax increases and political challenges of explaining economically efficient but counterintuitive policies like exempting structures while raising land taxes.

### 4.6 Critical Assessment: Tax Policy and Housing Justice

The tax policy literature establishes that housing receives uniquely favorable treatment that violates both economic efficiency and horizontal equity. These subsidies are regressive, capitalize into prices rather than expanding access, and misallocate capital away from productive investment. Yet reform proves extraordinarily resistant to political efforts, persisting despite economic consensus that subsidies fail to achieve stated goals.

For POD theory, this creates deep problems. If democratizing homeownership means extending tax-subsidized ownership to broader populations, then POD amplifies inefficiencies and inequities rather than correcting them. Wider homeownership creates larger constituencies defending inefficient subsidies, making reform even more difficult. The political economy moves away from efficiency and justice rather than toward them.

Moreover, tax subsidies reveal the mechanisms through which housing wealth concentrates. Non-taxation of imputed rent and capital gains allows homeowners to accumulate wealth tax-free. These accumulated advantages compound across generations through inheritance. The tax system actively constructs housing inequality rather than merely failing to correct market-generated disparities. POD has no answer to how widely dispersed ownership could overcome these tax-driven dynamics when dispersed ownership itself creates constituencies defending tax advantages.

The fiscal neutrality literature also highlights an alternative framework: rather than subsidizing ownership, policy could aim for tenure neutrality, ensuring that neither owning nor renting receives tax preference. This would require taxing imputed rent and capital gains while expanding rental affordability assistance. Such reforms would promote genuine choice based on household circumstances rather than artificial incentives. But achieving fiscal neutrality requires overcoming entrenched homeowner opposition—a political challenge that suggests limits on democratic reform of housing policy.

The next section examines land value theory, connecting housing's fiscal treatment to fundamental questions about the social creation of value and justice in capturing returns on public investment.

---

## Section 5: Land Value and the Social Creation of Rent

### 5.1 Classical Political Economy and the Land Question

Classical political economists—from Smith and Ricardo through Mill and George—recognized land as a distinctive factor of production requiring separate analytical treatment. Unlike capital (which can be produced) or labor (which responds to incentives), land is fixed in supply. This means that increased demand for land does not call forth additional supply but merely increases land rents—payments to landowners for access to fixed locations. Land rent thus represents a pure transfer from users to owners rather than compensation for productive contribution.

Henry George (1879) advanced this insight into a comprehensive theory of distributive justice. For George, land value arises entirely from social progress—population growth, public investment in infrastructure, and agglomeration economies. Individual landowners contribute nothing to creating land value yet capture these returns through ownership. This represents systematic injustice: private parties capturing socially created value without compensation to the public that created it. George argued for land value taxation (the "single tax") as both efficient (not distorting economic activity since land is fixed) and just (capturing for the public what the public created).

Georgist analysis applies with particular force to housing. House prices in desirable locations reflect land value far more than structure value—the building itself might cost $200,000 to construct, but location in San Francisco vs. Detroit creates million-dollar price differences. These locational premiums arise from public investments (transit, schools, amenities) and agglomeration economies (job access, cultural vitality), not from anything landowners or homeowners contribute. Yet private ownership allows individuals to capture these socially created returns.

### 5.2 The Henry George Theorem and Optimal City Size

Modern urban economics formalized Georgist insights through the "Henry George Theorem." Arnott and Stiglitz (1979) demonstrated that in optimally sized cities, aggregate land rents exactly equal the efficient level of public goods provision. This remarkable result suggests that land value taxation could fund optimal public investment without additional taxation—the increase in land values from public goods would generate revenue precisely sufficient to fund them.

The theorem's implications for housing justice are profound. It implies that current land values substantially reflect past and ongoing public investment rather than private contribution. Allowing private landowners to capture these returns means they receive windfalls from public spending while governments must tax productive activity (labor and capital) to fund the public goods that create land value. This system is both inefficient (distorting labor and capital markets through taxation) and unjust (transferring socially created value to private hands).

For housing, the Henry George Theorem suggests that price appreciation in well-served locations represents primarily capitalization of public investment. Homeowners who bought property decades ago in neighborhoods that subsequently benefited from transit expansion, school improvements, or economic development capture value created by public spending and agglomeration effects. This accumulated "unearned increment" (in George's term) transfers wealth to those fortunate in timing and location rather than rewarding productive contribution.

Foldvary (2007) argues that land value taxation represents "the ultimate tax reform" because it captures socially created value, provides efficient public finance, and reduces land speculation. By taxing away location premiums, LVT would dramatically reduce housing prices in desirable areas while maintaining incentives for productive investment in structures. The revenue could fund public goods or redistributive programs, creating a self-financing system where public investment generates revenue through increased land values that taxation captures.

### 5.3 Land Speculation and Economic Instability

Gaffney (2009) argues that land speculation—buying land not for use but for anticipated appreciation—plays central roles in economic crises. Because land is fixed in supply, speculation can drive prices far above use values without triggering supply responses that correct bubbles in other markets. Credit-fueled land speculation creates boom-bust cycles that destabilize financial systems and broader economies.

The 2000s housing bubble illustrates these dynamics. Mortgage credit expansion allowed buyers to bid up prices for limited land, with appreciation expectations fueling further borrowing and purchase. Because housing supply in desirable locations is inelastic, this credit-driven demand translated into price inflation rather than construction booms. When expectations reversed and credit tightened, prices collapsed, triggering the global financial crisis. Gaffney argues that land's distinctive features—fixed supply, speculation-prone, credit-financed—make land markets especially unstable and dangerous for financial systems.

Ryan-Collins et al. (2017) connect these dynamics to housing's dual role as consumption good and financial asset. They argue that modern housing crises reflect the housing-finance cycle: credit expansion drives land price appreciation, which enables further borrowing through home equity, fueling continued price growth until debt burdens become unsustainable. Breaking this cycle requires either constraining mortgage credit (politically difficult given homeowner opposition) or capturing land value through taxation (preventing speculative appreciation).

Land value taxation could stabilize housing markets by removing speculative returns. If appreciation merely increases tax liability rather than owner wealth, speculation becomes unprofitable. LVT forces land to be used productively rather than held for appreciation, increasing effective supply and reducing prices. Yang and Hawley (2022) provide empirical evidence from Pennsylvania jurisdictions with split-rate taxation, finding that higher land tax rates relative to structure taxes increase development intensity and moderate price appreciation.

### 5.4 Land Value Capture and Justice

The normative case for land value taxation connects economic efficiency to distributive justice. Efficiency: land is fixed in supply, so taxing it does not distort economic activity the way income or capital taxes do. Justice: land value arises from social investment and agglomeration economies, so private capture represents unjust appropriation of socially created value. Combining these insights suggests LVT as both economically optimal and distributively just.

For housing justice specifically, LVT offers a way to break the double bind between affordability and asset-based welfare. If land value taxation captures location premiums, then housing prices would fall dramatically while maintaining incentives for structure investment. Homeownership could provide secure shelter without requiring appreciation for wealth accumulation. The revenue from LVT could fund public housing, rental assistance, or universal basic income—creating alternative foundations for economic security not dependent on housing wealth.

Moreover, LVT addresses intergenerational equity concerns. Current systems allow early buyers to capture enormous untaxed gains from land appreciation, creating dynasties of advantage. LVT would prevent this accumulation, ensuring that each generation faces similar opportunities rather than increasingly unequal starting points determined by parental homeownership timing.

Kerr (2019) explicitly connects land value taxation to property-owning democracy, arguing that LVT provides a mechanism for preventing wealth concentration while maintaining private property in structures and productive capital. By taxing away location premiums—the socially created component of property value—LVT ensures that ownership reflects productive contribution rather than positional advantage. This aligns property ownership with POD's egalitarian aims in ways that undifferentiated homeownership promotion does not.

### 5.5 Political Economy of Land Value Taxation Reform

Despite strong theoretical arguments for LVT, implementation remains rare and politically challenging. The Lincoln Institute (2023) surveys global experience, finding scattered examples (Pennsylvania municipalities, some jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand) but no large-scale national implementation. Duke and Gao (2023) use experimental methods to understand why, finding that even when LVT would benefit most participants, political support remains limited and fragile.

The political obstacles reflect the same dynamics identified throughout this review: entrenched interests defending current property values. Transitioning to LVT would reduce land values (though not structure values) as the tax capitalizes into prices. Current landowners would bear transitional losses, creating fierce opposition even though future owners would benefit from lower purchase prices. The political economy problem is distributional conflict between current and future generations—those currently owning land oppose reforms that would benefit those not yet owning.

Moreover, LVT requires sophisticated assessment capabilities to separate land value from structure value and update assessments regularly to reflect changing location premiums. These administrative challenges are manageable technically but provide political cover for opponents to claim impracticality. Homeowners lobby against regular reassessment (as seen in property tax revolts) because it would increase tax liability as property appreciates. The result is outdated assessments that understate actual values, further entrenching advantages for long-term owners.

Finally, LVT challenges ideological commitments to homeownership as wealth-building mechanism. If housing should provide secure shelter but not appreciation-driven wealth accumulation, this contradicts decades of policy rhetoric about homeownership as path to middle-class prosperity. Constituencies that have been told homeownership is their primary wealth-building strategy resist policies that would eliminate appreciation-driven returns even if affordability would improve.

### 5.6 Critical Assessment: Land Value and Housing Justice

The land economics literature provides crucial insights for housing justice and POD theory. First, it demonstrates that housing price appreciation in desirable locations reflects primarily social value creation—public investment and agglomeration economies—rather than individual contribution. Private capture of this socially created value represents systemic injustice that homeownership promotion amplifies rather than corrects.

Second, land value taxation offers a theoretically attractive solution: capture socially created value for public purposes while maintaining incentives for productive investment. LVT could simultaneously address affordability (by removing speculative returns), intergenerational equity (by preventing accumulation of unearned increments), and public finance (by taxing location rents rather than productive activity). This suggests a coherent alternative to asset-based welfare centered on homeownership appreciation.

Third, the political economy of LVT reform reveals the obstacles facing any fundamental housing reform. Entrenched homeowner interests defend current property values against policies that would benefit non-owners and future generations. This political economy problem reflects housing's intergenerational distributive conflicts—current owners benefit from high prices and appreciation; future buyers need affordability and stability. Democratic politics struggles to resolve such conflicts when current owners are the median voter.

For POD theory, land value analysis reveals why dispersing homeownership fails to achieve egalitarian aims. If housing wealth accumulates primarily through capture of socially created location value, then broader ownership merely spreads the injustice more widely. It does not prevent some locations from appreciating far more than others, creating spatial inequality. It does not address intergenerational transfers of accumulated appreciation. And it creates political constituencies defending private capture of social value rather than supporting public recapture through taxation.

The next section synthesizes findings across all five domains to demonstrate systematically why housing breaks the property-owning democracy framework and what this implies for housing justice.

## Section 6: Synthesis - Why Housing Breaks Property-Owning Democracy

### 6.1 The Distinctive Economic and Social Features of Housing

This review has examined five interconnected literatures: political philosophy's property-owning democracy ideal, political economy's asset-based welfare regimes, housing financialization and political economy, tax policy and fiscal neutrality, and land value theory. Synthesizing across these domains reveals that housing possesses a distinctive combination of economic and social features that break the POD framework:

**Non-fungibility**: Unlike productive capital or financial assets, housing is irreducibly location-specific. Owning a home in Detroit provides fundamentally different economic benefits from owning one in San Francisco. POD theory assumes assets are generally fungible—ownership provides economic security regardless of which specific assets one owns. But housing's non-fungibility means that even perfectly equal ownership rates generate massive inequality based on geography and timing. Early buyers in appreciating locations accumulate wealth unavailable to identical households buying elsewhere or later.

**Positional scarcity**: Housing in desirable locations is inherently scarce—locational advantages cannot be replicated the way productive capital can be expanded. This means housing is a positional good: its value depends on relative position in spatial hierarchies that broader ownership cannot flatten. POD assumes that dispersing productive asset ownership increases overall productivity or at least does not reduce it. But housing supply in desirable locations is inelastic. Democratizing homeownership changes who owns positional goods but does not reduce positional inequality.

**Dual use/exchange value**: Housing simultaneously provides consumption value (shelter) and exchange value (financial asset). This creates the double bind: the state needs housing to be affordable (low prices for access) and appreciating (high prices for asset-based welfare). No other major asset faces this contradiction—productive capital can appreciate without becoming unaffordable to new workers, and consumption goods need not appreciate to provide value. Housing's dual role creates systematic tensions that POD cannot resolve.

**Socially created value**: Land values arise primarily from public investment and agglomeration economies rather than individual contribution. Yet private ownership allows individuals to capture these socially created returns. POD theory focuses on preventing private appropriation of productive returns, but it lacks frameworks for addressing systematic private capture of social value. Homeownership promotion amplifies rather than addresses this injustice.

**Financial transformation**: Housing has been actively transformed from consumption good into financial asset through state policy, creating constituencies defending financialized housing against reform. Broad homeownership creates "homevoter" politics prioritizing property values over housing access. This contradicts POD's assumption that dispersed ownership creates support for equality-preserving institutions.

### 6.2 How POD Assumptions Fail for Housing

POD theory rests on several key assumptions that prove false when applied to housing:

**Assumption 1: Asset fungibility enables equal distribution**. POD assumes that distributing ownership of productive assets can achieve genuine equality because assets are roughly fungible—different forms of capital provide similar economic security. But housing is irreducibly spatial, and location determines value far more than structure characteristics. Even perfect homeownership equality would leave enormous inequality based on geography and purchase timing.

**Assumption 2: Broader ownership supports egalitarian politics**. POD assumes that when most citizens own productive assets, they support institutions maintaining egalitarian distributions. Freeman (2013) argues that widespread ownership creates constituencies for preventing concentration. But housing provides a counterexample: broad homeownership creates powerful constituencies opposing precisely the policies (supply expansion, price stabilization, fiscal neutrality) that justice requires. Homeowners vote to restrict supply, defend tax subsidies, and oppose rental tenant protections. Democratizing ownership produces anti-egalitarian political economy.

**Assumption 3: Ownership provides economic security**. POD aims to ensure economic independence through asset ownership, protecting citizens from domination and enabling political participation as equals. But homeownership provides highly unequal security depending on location, timing, and market conditions. Owners in declining regions see wealth erode while owners in appreciating areas accumulate windfalls. Ownership does not protect against spatial inequality or market volatility—it exposes households to these forces.

**Assumption 4: Predistribution can prevent inequality**. POD emphasizes predistributive institutions that shape primary distributions rather than merely redistributing after markets operate. But housing wealth accumulates primarily through appreciation—capital gains on fixed assets—which reflects social value creation and market dynamics beyond individual control. Predistributive institutions cannot prevent appreciation-driven inequality without fundamentally restricting property rights or capturing appreciation through taxation (which POD theory does not adequately address).

**Assumption 5: Markets coordinate efficiently when ownership distributes widely**. POD assumes that with appropriate background institutions ensuring dispersed ownership, markets can coordinate economic activity efficiently and justly. But housing markets with dispersed ownership exhibit systematic failures: they under-supply in high-demand areas (zoning restrictions protecting homeowner wealth), over-leverage households (mortgage debt funding consumption), and generate boom-bust cycles destabilizing financial systems. Dispersed ownership worsens rather than corrects these failures.

### 6.3 The Political Economy of Homeowner Democracy

Synthesizing the political economy insights from sections 2-5 reveals a coherent logic of homeowner democracy that contradicts POD aspirations:

When homeownership becomes the primary asset for median households, homeowners become a powerful political constituency with interests systematically opposed to egalitarian housing policy. They support policies that inflate property values: restricting supply through zoning, subsidizing mortgage credit, providing tax preferences, and opposing rental tenant protections. They oppose policies that might moderate prices or improve affordability for non-owners: planning reform, social housing construction, fiscal neutrality, or land value taxation.

This political economy is not accidental or contingent but emerges systematically from housing's characteristics. Because housing is a positional good with inelastic supply in desirable locations, homeowners benefit from scarcity. Because housing appreciation provides wealth accumulation and retirement security in asset-based welfare systems, homeowners depend on price growth. Because location premiums reflect public investment, homeowners have incentives to support public goods that increase property values while opposing taxation that captures these gains.

The result is a systematic bias in democratic politics toward policies that worsen affordability while protecting homeowner wealth. This is not policy failure but successful responsiveness to homeowner constituencies. Governments do what democratic publics want—but when those publics are dominated by homeowners, they want protection of property values over housing access. POD's aspiration to create equality-supporting politics through dispersed ownership founders on this reality.

Moreover, the political economy exhibits path dependence and lock-in effects. Once housing wealth becomes central to household welfare and financial system stability, governments cannot permit significant price corrections without severe consequences. This creates ratchets: prices can only go up, never down, because political economy and financial stability depend on sustained appreciation. The system requires permanent bubbles, which are inherently unstable and eventually crash with devastating welfare effects.

### 6.4 Intergenerational and Spatial Inequality

Housing generates distinctive forms of inequality that POD theory cannot address. Intergenerational inequality arises because housing wealth accumulates through appreciation that depends on purchase timing. Early buyers in locations that subsequently appreciated capture enormous untaxed gains. Later buyers face inflated prices with limited appreciation potential. This creates generational wealth divides independent of income or effort—advantage transmits through property ownership timing and family transfers.

Spatial inequality arises because housing is irreducibly location-specific, and locations provide fundamentally different access to economic opportunities and public goods. Owning property in thriving cities provides wealth accumulation and access to jobs, schools, and services unavailable in declining regions. Even perfect homeownership equality would leave enormous spatial inequalities that ownership itself cannot overcome.

These forms of inequality resist traditional redistributive policies. The wealth accumulates through appreciation rather than taxable income. It transfers through inheritance and family support rather than market transactions subject to taxation. And it compounds across generations as housing wealth enables better education, business investment, and subsequent property purchases. POD has no answer to these dynamics—dispersing ownership does not prevent them but spreads them more widely.

### 6.5 The Impossibility of Tenure Neutrality Under POD

The fiscal neutrality literature (Section 4) reveals another fundamental tension. Achieving genuine tenure neutrality—treating ownership and renting equally in tax and subsidy systems—would require taxing imputed rental income and capital gains while eliminating mortgage interest deductions. But these reforms would dramatically reduce homeownership's financial attractiveness, lowering property values and undermining asset-based welfare.

This creates a dilemma: either maintain tax advantages for homeownership (violating neutrality and entrenching inequality) or eliminate them (crashing values and destroying household wealth). POD theory offers no way to navigate this choice. If POD requires widespread homeownership but homeownership depends on tax subsidies that violate equity and efficiency, then POD institutionalizes injustice rather than correcting it.

Moreover, achieving fiscal neutrality faces overwhelming political obstacles from homeowner constituencies defending tax advantages. The political economy of democratized homeownership makes reform impossible—exactly the opposite of POD's claim that dispersed ownership supports equality-preserving institutions. Housing reveals that POD's political economy assumptions reverse when assets are positional goods with inelastic supply.

### 6.6 Alternative Frameworks: Beyond Homeownership

The literature points toward alternative frameworks that break from homeownership-centered approaches:

**Decommodification**: Madden and Marcuse (2016) argue for removing housing from market allocation entirely through expanded social housing. If housing is a social right rather than commodity, appreciation becomes irrelevant and the double bind dissolves. Decommodification allows policy to focus on providing secure, affordable shelter without requiring asset appreciation for welfare purposes.

**Land value capture**: Georgist approaches suggest capturing socially created location value through taxation while maintaining private ownership of structures. This could break housing-finance cycles by removing speculative returns while maintaining incentives for productive investment. Revenue from land value taxation could fund public housing, rental assistance, or universal basic income—alternatives to asset-based welfare.

**Tenure neutrality**: Achieving genuine neutrality between owning and renting would require eliminating homeownership tax advantages while strengthening rental sector protections and affordability assistance. This would allow households to choose tenures based on circumstances rather than artificial incentives, while addressing affordability directly through income-based assistance rather than asset-based welfare.

**Spatial equity**: Rather than democratizing homeownership, policy could focus on ensuring that all locations provide adequate access to employment, education, services, and amenities. This would address the underlying spatial inequalities that make location premiums so valuable, reducing the stakes of who owns where.

These alternatives share common features: they decouple welfare provision from housing wealth accumulation, they address spatial and intergenerational inequalities that ownership cannot overcome, and they recognize housing's distinctive features requiring different treatment from productive capital. None of them fit neatly within POD frameworks because all require moving beyond ownership-centered approaches to housing justice.

## Conclusion: Research Gaps and Work Package 4's Contribution

### 7.1 Synthesizing the Gaps

This literature review has examined five interconnected domains of scholarship bearing on housing justice and property-owning democracy. Each literature provides valuable insights, but systematic gaps exist at their intersections:

**Gap 1: Political philosophers have not engaged with housing's economic specificity**. POD theory treats assets as roughly fungible and assumes dispersed ownership creates egalitarian politics. But housing is non-fungible, positional, and politically generates anti-egalitarian constituencies. Philosophers advancing POD cite housing as a natural application of POD principles (Erck 2024) without grappling with the empirical political economy showing that homeowner democracies systematically resist egalitarian housing policy. The philosophical literature needs engagement with housing's distinctive economic and political features.

**Gap 2: Housing economists document homeownership failures without normative frameworks**. The empirical literature comprehensively shows that homeownership-centered systems generate affordability crises, intergenerational inequality, financial instability, and regressive tax subsidies. Yet this literature rarely connects these findings to theories of distributive justice or evaluates them against normative ideals. Housing economics needs engagement with political philosophy to develop justice-based evaluations of housing systems.

**Gap 3: Political economy analyzes asset-based welfare without connecting to POD debates**. The asset-based welfare literature shows how homeownership-centered systems transform politics and create path dependencies. But this literature does not engage with political philosophers promoting POD as an egalitarian ideal or evaluate whether these political economy dynamics contradict POD's theoretical aims. Political economy needs dialogue with political philosophy to assess whether POD's aspirations are achievable or systematically undermined by the political economy dispersed ownership creates.

**Gap 4: Tax policy identifies inefficiencies without explaining political persistence**. Economists have consensus that homeownership tax subsidies are inefficient, regressive, and counterproductive. Yet these subsidies persist across democracies despite recognized failures. Tax policy literature documents subsidies but does not adequately explain why reform proves impossible or connect this to broader questions about housing's political economy and justice. Understanding tax policy requires political economy analysis of homeowner constituencies and their resistance to reform.

**Gap 5: Land value theory provides justice frameworks but lacks implementation strategies**. Georgian economics offers compelling normative arguments that land value taxation is both efficient and just, capturing socially created value for public purposes. But implementation remains rare, and the literature does not adequately address the political economy obstacles: entrenched landowner opposition, intergenerational distributive conflicts, and ideological commitments to homeownership as wealth-building. Land value theory needs realistic political economy to move from theoretical ideal to feasible reform.

**Gap 6: No synthesis shows why housing breaks POD systematically**. While individual literatures identify specific problems—political economy shows homeowner resistance, housing economics documents inequality, tax policy reveals inefficiency—no existing work synthesizes across these domains to demonstrate that housing's distinctive features systematically contradict POD's core logic. The gaps are not merely empirical complications that ideal theory can bracket but fundamental tensions between POD's assumptions and housing's economic and social reality.

### 7.2 Work Package 4's Specific Contributions

Work Package 4 addresses these gaps through several integrated contributions:

**Contribution 1: Demonstrates that housing is not a fungible asset**. Unlike productive capital, housing is irreducibly location-specific and positional. This means that even perfectly equal homeownership rates generate massive inequality based on geography and timing. WP4 shows that POD theory's assumption of asset fungibility fails for housing in ways that are not merely empirical complications but conceptual problems demanding different normative frameworks.

**Contribution 2: Reveals the political economy contradiction**. POD assumes dispersed ownership creates constituencies supporting egalitarian institutions. WP4 demonstrates that for housing, the opposite occurs: homeowner democracies systematically resist policies required for housing justice. This is not policy failure but successful responsiveness to homeowner constituencies whose material interests oppose affordability, supply expansion, and fiscal neutrality. The contribution is showing this contradicts POD's core political economy assumptions.

**Contribution 3: Analyzes the double bind of asset-based housing welfare**. The state needs housing to be affordable (low prices) and appreciating (high prices). This contradiction has no stable resolution within market frameworks. WP4 shows this is not merely a policy challenge but a systematic feature of treating housing as both consumption good and investment asset. POD's promotion of homeownership amplifies rather than resolves this tension.

**Contribution 4: Connects housing injustice to social value creation**. Land values arise from public investment and agglomeration economies, yet private ownership allows individuals to capture these socially created returns. WP4 demonstrates that homeownership promotion entrenches rather than corrects this injustice. The contribution connects Georgian land value theory to contemporary housing justice debates, showing that private capture of social value violates POD's own principles about preventing unearned advantages.

**Contribution 5: Explains intergenerational and spatial inequality persistence**. Housing wealth accumulates through appreciation that depends on timing and location rather than individual contribution. WP4 shows these forms of inequality resist traditional redistributive policies and compound across generations. The contribution is demonstrating that ownership-centered approaches cannot overcome these inequalities—different normative and policy frameworks are required.

**Contribution 6: Proposes decoupling welfare from housing markets**. Rather than pursuing housing justice through democratized homeownership, WP4 argues for decoupling welfare provision from housing wealth. This means expanding social housing, implementing land value taxation, achieving fiscal neutrality, and developing welfare systems not dependent on asset appreciation. The contribution is not merely identifying homeownership's limits but showing systematically why these limits demand moving beyond POD for housing.

### 7.3 Methodological Contributions

Beyond substantive claims, WP4 contributes methodologically by demonstrating the necessity of interdisciplinary synthesis for evaluating housing justice proposals. Political philosophy alone cannot assess POD's housing applications without understanding housing's economic specificity, political economy, and policy implementation challenges. Housing economics alone cannot evaluate justice without normative frameworks. Political economy alone cannot assess whether observed politics contradicts or confirms POD ideals without engaging philosophical claims.

WP4 shows that normative and positive questions cannot be separated when evaluating institutional feasibility. POD is not merely an ideal that empirical complications might prevent from being realized—the empirical complications reveal conceptual problems with applying POD to housing. The political economy of homeowner democracy does not merely make POD difficult to implement for housing; it shows that POD's core assumptions about how ownership shapes politics fail for positional goods with inelastic supply.

This methodological point generalizes beyond housing. POD theory developed primarily to think about productive capital—assets that can be expanded and whose broader ownership might enhance efficiency and equality. The theory cannot be straightforwardly applied to other asset types without examining their economic and social specificity. Housing provides a crucial test case revealing POD's limits and the necessity of tailored normative frameworks for different economic domains.

### 7.4 Forward-Looking Research Agenda

This review identifies several priority areas for future research:

**Priority 1: Develop political theory of non-fungible positional goods**. What principles of justice apply to inherently scarce, location-specific goods that cannot be expanded to meet demand? Housing, urban land, and environmental amenities share features that POD's fungible-asset framework cannot address. Political philosophy needs conceptual tools for thinking about justice for positional goods where allocation inevitably creates relative advantages.

**Priority 2: Analyze political economy of tenure transitions**. How might democracies with high homeownership rates transition toward alternative systems (expanded social housing, stronger rental sectors, land value taxation)? What compensation or transition mechanisms might overcome homeowner opposition? Understanding barriers to reform is necessary for developing feasible paths toward housing justice.

**Priority 3: Design welfare systems independent of housing wealth**. What alternative foundations for economic security could replace asset-based housing welfare? Universal basic income, expanded social insurance, or public housing provision represent possibilities, but their political economy and distributional implications require analysis. Housing justice requires not merely critique of homeownership-centered systems but viable alternatives.

**Priority 4: Connect housing justice to spatial justice**. Housing's non-fungibility means location determines access to opportunities and quality of life. Housing justice requires addressing spatial inequalities—ensuring all locations provide adequate employment, education, services, and amenities. Research should connect housing policy to regional development, public investment allocation, and spatial equity.

**Priority 5: Examine intergenerational justice in housing**. Housing wealth concentrates across generations through appreciation and inheritance. What principles of justice apply to intergenerational transfers of location-specific advantages? How should policy address intergenerational inequalities that compound over time? Housing provides a crucial case for developing theories of dynamic, multigenerational justice.

**Priority 6: Develop comparative analysis of alternative housing systems**. How do countries with lower homeownership rates (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) achieve housing security and spatial equity through rental tenure? What institutional arrangements enable robust rental sectors with security and affordability? Comparative research can identify feasible alternatives to homeownership-centered systems.

### 7.5 Policy Implications

While this review focuses on scholarly gaps rather than direct policy prescription, several implications emerge:

**Implication 1: Promoting homeownership is not a housing justice strategy**. Democratizing homeownership does not address and may worsen housing inequality, affordability, and intergenerational equity. Policymakers should shift from homeownership promotion to ensuring secure, affordable housing across tenures.

**Implication 2: Land value capture should be central to housing policy**. Since location value arises from public investment and agglomeration economies, capturing these returns through taxation is both efficient and just. Land value taxation could simultaneously address affordability (removing speculative returns), finance public investment, and reduce intergenerational inequality.

**Implication 3: Achieving fiscal neutrality requires confronting homeowner politics**. Tax subsidies for homeownership entrench inequality and resist reform because of homeowner political power. Achieving neutrality requires either political strategies to overcome this opposition or compensation mechanisms to make reform acceptable to current owners.

**Implication 4: Rental sector strengthening matters for housing justice**. Strong, secure rental sectors provide alternatives to ownership-based welfare. Policies ensuring long-term tenure security, rent stabilization, and quality standards can provide housing security without requiring wealth accumulation through appreciation.

**Implication 5: Spatial equity must complement housing policy**. Because housing is location-specific, ensuring justice requires addressing spatial inequalities in access to employment, education, and services. Housing policy alone cannot overcome injustices rooted in uneven spatial development.

### 7.6 Final Synthesis

This review has examined five interconnected literatures to demonstrate that housing's distinctive economic and social features systematically contradict property-owning democracy's core logic. Housing is non-fungible and positional, making equal ownership insufficient for equality. Housing's dual role as consumption good and investment asset creates irresolvable double binds. Housing's transformation into financial assets generates political economies resistant to egalitarian reform. Housing wealth reflects social value creation that private ownership unjustly captures. And housing's intergenerational and spatial inequality dynamics resist ownership-centered solutions.

The gaps identified across literatures reflect disciplinary boundaries preventing adequate synthesis. Political philosophers advance POD without engaging housing's economic specificity. Housing economists document failures without normative frameworks. Political economists analyze asset-based welfare without connecting to justice theories. Tax policy analysts identify inefficiencies without explaining political persistence. Land theorists provide justice arguments without realistic political economy.

Work Package 4 synthesizes across these domains to show that housing justice requires moving beyond property-owning democracy. The contribution is not merely empirical documentation of homeownership's failures (well-established) but systematic demonstration that these failures reflect fundamental tensions between POD's conceptual framework and housing's economic and social reality. Housing does not merely challenge POD's implementation but reveals limits in its core logic when applied to non-fungible positional goods.

The path forward requires decoupling welfare provision from housing wealth accumulation, capturing socially created land value for public purposes, achieving genuine fiscal neutrality between tenures, and ensuring spatial equity across regions. These goals demand institutional innovations beyond POD's ownership-centered approach. Housing justice, it turns out, requires moving beyond property-owning democracy—not because the ideal is too ambitious, but because housing breaks the framework on which the ideal depends.
