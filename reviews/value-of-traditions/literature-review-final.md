## Introduction

Traditions are ubiquitous in political and cultural life—constitutional frameworks, democratic practices, religious observances, professional standards, cultural identities. Yet their normative status remains deeply contested. When should we defer to inherited wisdom versus subject traditions to critical scrutiny? This question is fundamentally normative, concerning not what traditions *are* conceptually but when and why they are *valuable*—or not. Contemporary philosophy reveals three major positions structuring debate: conservative epistemic arguments claiming tradition embodies accumulated practical wisdom (Robson 2025; Levy 2017); communitarian constitutive arguments that traditions constitute rationality and identity (MacIntyre 1988; Taylor 1989); and liberal-critical positions asserting tradition's value is conditional, constrained by autonomy, justice, and equality (Scheffler 2010; Okin 1999).

The central tension emerges sharply: traditions simultaneously enable meaningful political life while potentially perpetuating domination. MacIntyre's *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988) articulates the strongest philosophical case that all rationality is tradition-constituted—different traditions embody incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical reason, making tradition not optional but necessary for intelligible moral inquiry. Yet Okin's feminist critique asks pointedly "Is multiculturalism bad for women?" (1999), demonstrating how cultural traditions systematically subordinate women while claiming authenticity. How do we distinguish valuable from oppressive traditions when both fulfill constitutive roles in identity and community?

Recent work complicates simple dichotomies. Beckstein's concept of "living traditions" (2017) distinguishes traditions exhibiting continuity, active practice, internal contestation, and critical reflection from ossified or defunct ones—only living traditions generate special normative force. Scheffler's "conditional value" thesis (2010) argues traditions have genuine but defeasible normative significance through their identity-constituting role, requiring neither uncritical preservation nor wholesale rejection. Yet conditions for distinguishing living from dead traditions, or valuable from harmful ones, remain systematically underspecified.

This review examines how philosophy analyzes and explains tradition's value across four major domains. Section 1 establishes theoretical foundations—the meta-ethical frameworks (intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive value), authority structures, and MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality that provide conceptual architecture. Section 2 examines three major defenses: conservative epistemic arguments about tradition's accumulated wisdom, communitarian virtue ethics emphasizing constitutive role in identity and practical wisdom, and liberal multiculturalism's attempted reconciliation with autonomy. Section 3 analyzes critical objections—feminist and liberal autonomy-based critiques, structural domination analyses, and normative criteria for abandoning traditions. Section 4 synthesizes findings, identifying research gaps and proposing an integrative framework balancing epistemic, constitutive, and justice dimensions.

The review strategy emphasizes normative arguments and conditions of value rather than comprehensive coverage. It focuses on major philosophical debates and critical tensions, particularly the productive but unresolved conflict between universal moral standards (needed to critique harmful traditions) and cultural particularity (needed to avoid imperialism). This tension may be inherent in the question of tradition's value rather than a solvable problem.


## Section 1: Theoretical Foundations of Tradition's Value

Before examining specific philosophical defenses of tradition's value, we must establish the meta-level frameworks for understanding *how* traditions generate normative force. The literature reveals three distinct approaches: value-theoretic analyses distinguishing what types of value traditions possess, accounts emphasizing temporality and authority, and MacIntyre's radical thesis that traditions constitute rationality itself. These frameworks provide essential conceptual tools for evaluating competing positions.

### Meta-Ethical Frameworks: Intrinsic, Instrumental, and Constitutive Value

Standard value theory distinguishes intrinsic value (valuable in itself), instrumental value (valuable as means to ends), and final value (valuable as end) (Schroeder 2021). Yet tradition resists these categories. Conservative arguments frequently slide between claiming tradition has intrinsic value—that mere antiquity or continuity matters independently of content—and epistemic instrumental value, where traditions are valuable as reliable guides to truth or practical wisdom (Hamilton 2015). This equivocation generates confusion. Is tradition valuable *because it is tradition*, or because traditions tend to preserve wisdom?

Scheffler (2010) develops the most influential liberal response through his "conditional value" thesis: traditions have genuine but defeasible normative force through their identity-constituting role. Traditions shape personal and collective identity in ways that give them non-instrumental significance—they are not mere means to independent ends but partly constitute what makes lives meaningful. Yet this value remains conditional: traditions matter because of their role in human flourishing, not as independent sources of authority. When traditions conflict with more fundamental moral considerations, their value can be outweighed. This position attempts to navigate between dismissing tradition entirely and granting it absolute authority.

Kumar (2019) argues that Scheffler's framework underestimates tradition's constitutive role by treating it as merely conditionally valuable. Kumar proposes that traditions possess "framework value"—they structure the evaluative space within which other goods are pursued without themselves being ends-in-themselves. This moves beyond the simple intrinsic/instrumental dichotomy by showing how traditions can be normatively significant as background conditions for meaningful choice and evaluation. The concept parallels Rawls's account of primary goods as all-purpose means, but applies to cultural-evaluative frameworks rather than material resources.

Wall (2016) offers a more systematic tripartite analysis distinguishing among epistemic authority (traditions as reliable guides to truth), practical authority (traditions as sources of obligations), and expressive authority (traditions as vehicles for identity). This taxonomy helps disambiguate tradition's value-types, showing that traditions may simultaneously possess multiple forms of authority grounded in different considerations. Epistemic authority depends on reliability of tradition's causal history; practical authority requires that traditions generate genuine reasons for action; expressive authority emerges from traditions' role in constituting valuable identities. Wall's framework reveals that debates about tradition's value often involve competing assessments of which authority-type predominates.

Casal (2020) extends the conditional value approach through case studies of controversial practices like whaling and bullfighting. She argues that traditions contribute to social cohesion and cultural meaning, providing prima facie reasons to maintain them. However, these contributions cannot override weightier moral considerations, especially harm to sentient beings. Tradition provides reasons for action but not decisive or exclusionary reasons. Casal's analysis shows how conditional value works in practice: tradition's weight varies with both its contributions to identity and its costs measured against independent moral standards.

The value-theoretic literature thus reveals fundamental disagreement about whether tradition possesses intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive, or framework value. This disagreement is not merely terminological but reflects deeper conflicts about tradition's normative foundations. The question "what kind of value do traditions have?" remains contested because different philosophical frameworks employ incompatible evaluative structures.

### Authority, Temporality, and Living Traditions

Authority claims are central to tradition's normative force, yet what grounds such authority? Historical pedigree alone cannot justify normative claims without vicious circularity—the past cannot bind the present merely by being past. Christiano (2021) distinguishes de facto authority (actual power to command) from legitimate authority (moral right to command), noting that legitimate authority requires justification through consent, fair procedures, or service to recognizable goods. Traditional authority, considered as one possible basis for legitimacy, must meet these standards rather than claiming self-justification through antiquity.

Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition and authority in hermeneutic philosophy offers an alternative approach. Dostal (2016) explicates how Gadamer challenges the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice," arguing that all understanding requires pre-judgments inherited from tradition. These prejudices are not obstacles to knowledge but its condition—we cannot understand without interpretive frameworks received from our cultural-historical situation. Authority can be rational when grounded in genuine expertise: we rationally submit to epistemic authority when experts know more than we do. Similarly, tradition's authority need not involve blind submission but can be rational acknowledgment of its epistemic resources. This view reframes tradition from dogmatic constraint to enabling condition for understanding.

Allan (1986) develops a complementary phenomenological account of how the past acquires normative significance. He distinguishes types of importance: inherited (given through tradition), imagined (projected through ideal), and created (achieved through action). Tradition's authority emerges from the recursive relationship between inherited meanings and present interpretation—neither purely given nor purely constructed but dialogically achieved. The past imposes constraints (we cannot choose our inheritance) yet remains open to reinterpretation (we choose what to emphasize and develop). This dynamic conception avoids both conservative reification of tradition as fixed and liberal voluntarism that treats tradition as optional.

Beckstein's (2017) concept of "living tradition" provides crucial criteria for distinguishing valuable traditions from ossified or defunct ones. Living traditions are characterized by: (1) continuity over time, (2) active practice and transmission, (3) internal contestation and development, (4) critical reflection by participants, and (5) capacity for adaptation. This account bridges conservative and liberal perspectives by showing that genuine traditions combine stability with change. Dead traditions are mere historical artifacts lacking present practitioners; dying traditions are ossifying through loss of internal vitality; only living traditions generate special normative force through their ongoing character as arguments embodying practical rationality.

Beckstein's framework addresses a fundamental problem: if all traditions possessed equal authority by virtue of being traditions, we would have no basis for distinguishing valuable from harmful ones. The "living tradition" concept provides normative criteria: traditions merit respect when they remain living arguments capable of self-criticism and development, not when they become fossilized dogmas. This distinction is essential for any account claiming traditions matter normatively—it shows *which* traditions matter and why.

Yet operationalizing "living" versus "dead" traditions proves difficult. How much internal contestation is required? What degree of adaptation is permissible before tradition loses identity? Beckstein provides conceptual framework but limited guidance for applying it to particular cases. The criteria remain underspecified, creating ambiguity in evaluating specific traditions. This gap between conceptual clarity and practical application recurs throughout the literature.

### MacIntyre's Tradition-Constituted Rationality

MacIntyre's work represents the most philosophically ambitious account of tradition's constitutive value. Across *After Virtue* (1981), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990), MacIntyre develops the thesis that all rationality is tradition-constituted. Different philosophical traditions—Aristotelian, Augustinian, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal—embody incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical reason. No tradition-independent standpoint exists from which to adjudicate between them. Rationality itself depends on the narrative and conceptual resources of particular traditions.

This is *not* relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions are "living arguments" capable of rational progress through dialectical engagement. Traditions develop by resolving internal epistemic crises—situations where their inherited resources prove inadequate to address new problems. A tradition demonstrates rationality by explaining its own history of development, understanding rival traditions better than those rivals understand themselves, and showing how its framework can resolve problems that defeated rivals. Rational superiority emerges from superior explanatory and problem-solving capacity, not correspondence to tradition-neutral standards.

D'Andrea (2006) clarifies that MacIntyre's position differs fundamentally from both conservative reverence for tradition-as-such and postmodern relativism. Conservative traditionalism treats tradition as authority demanding deference; MacIntyre treats traditions as ongoing inquiries requiring critical participation. Postmodern relativism denies rational progress across paradigms; MacIntyre shows how traditions can be evaluated through their capacity to resolve crises and comprehend rivals. Traditions are bearers of methodological as well as substantive commitments, enabling truth-seeking rather than merely preserving inherited beliefs.

MacIntyre's account operates at three levels showing tradition's pervasive constitutive role. At the individual level, virtues are excellences developed through participation in practices—coherent social activities with internal goods (standards of excellence) and external goods (social rewards). At the communal level, practices are embedded in traditions that provide the narrative and conceptual frameworks within which practices make sense. At the epistemic level, traditions constitute the standards of rational justification themselves. This three-level architecture shows how tradition shapes moral life from individual character through shared practices to the very structure of rationality.

The claim that traditions possess neither intrinsic value (independent of rational content) nor merely instrumental value (means to independent ends), but *constitutive* value as conditions for rational inquiry itself, represents MacIntyre's distinctive contribution. Traditions are not valuable because they are old, nor because they reliably produce good outcomes, but because they constitute the frameworks within which "old," "good," and "valuable" acquire determinate meaning. This meta-level argument, if successful, transforms the debate: the question becomes not whether to value tradition but which tradition provides the most adequate framework for inquiry.

Yet MacIntyre's framework faces significant challenges. If rationality is tradition-constituted, how do we evaluate traditions' rationality without vicious circularity? MacIntyre appeals to traditions' capacity for self-criticism and understanding rivals, but critics question whether this escapes the circle. If each tradition defines what counts as "understanding" and "rational progress," how can we adjudicate genuine disagreement? The framework risks collapsing into sophisticated relativism despite MacIntyre's protests. Moreover, by emphasizing rational inquiry, MacIntyre may understate traditions that constitute identity through emotional, ritual, or aesthetic resources beyond discursive argument. Not all valuable traditions are "living arguments" in MacIntyre's intellectualist sense.

Beadle and Moore (2011) extend MacIntyre's framework to organizational contexts, showing how institutions embody practices with internal goods while pursuing external goods. This application demonstrates tradition's constitutive role at institutional levels, but also reveals tensions: when institutional pressures conflict with practice-embedded traditions, practitioners experience moral distress. The MacIntyrean account explains why such conflicts are fundamental—they represent incompatible rationalities, not merely competing interests. Yet the framework provides limited guidance for resolving them beyond appealing to the superiority of practice-based rationality.

---

The theoretical foundations reveal three distinct frameworks for understanding tradition's value. Value-theoretic analyses distinguish types of value traditions may possess—intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive, or framework value—but fail to reach consensus on which applies. Accounts emphasizing temporality and authority show how tradition's normative force emerges through historical continuity and living development, but struggle to operationalize criteria for distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions. MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality provides the strongest philosophical articulation of tradition's constitutive value, yet faces challenges regarding circularity and intellectualism.

These frameworks are not mutually exclusive but highlight different aspects of tradition's normative significance. The question "what kind of value do traditions have?" resists simple answers because traditions simultaneously function as epistemic resources, identity-constituting frameworks, and conditions for rationality. Subsequent sections examine how specific philosophical traditions—conservative, communitarian, liberal—employ these foundational concepts to defend or critique tradition's value.

## Major Philosophical Defenses of Tradition's Value

Conservative epistemic arguments, communitarian virtue ethics, and liberal multiculturalism represent three major philosophical defenses of tradition's value. Each offers distinct logics for why traditions merit respect: tradition as repository of accumulated wisdom, tradition as constitutive of identity and rationality, and tradition as context enabling meaningful choice. Yet all three approaches face similar difficulties distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions—a tension that reveals deep unresolved problems in tradition theory.

### Conservative Epistemic Arguments—The Wisdom of Tradition

The Burkean core of conservative tradition defense holds that traditions embody accumulated practical wisdom tested by experience that abstract reason cannot fully grasp (Robson 2025). Epistemic humility counsels deference to inherited practices over rationalist blueprints. Robson's contemporary articulation distinguishes an "A Priori Theorizing Thesis" (abstract theories about justice merit low credence) and a "Non-substitution Thesis" (theorists shouldn't substitute their judgment for traditional wisdom). This develops Burke's original insight: what survives long historical testing likely contains wisdom exceeding any individual's theoretical constructions.

Oakeshott's sophisticated epistemology distinguishes technical knowledge (explicit principles) from practical knowledge (implicit understanding gained through participation in tradition). Political life depends on practical knowledge embedded in traditions, not rationalist abstractions (Wendland 2023). Even ostensibly rationalist theories like Rawls's depend on inherited practical understanding from Western constitutional tradition. Oakeshott's distinction between "knowing how" and "knowing that" shows tradition preserves forms of practical wisdom that cannot be fully articulated in theoretical principles (Marsh 2010, Franco 1990). This challenges not just radical rationalism but any attempt to reduce political wisdom to explicit doctrines.

The Hayekian spontaneous order framework extends this epistemic argument through information theory: traditions encode dispersed tacit knowledge no central planner can possess (Reimers 2021, Hamowy 1987). Market and legal traditions solve information problems through evolutionary selection that deliberate design cannot replicate. Hayek's critical rationalism—accepting institutional evolution through decentralized knowledge rather than comprehensive planning—provides philosophical foundation for preferring evolved traditions over rationalist construction (Angeli 2024). The Scottish Enlightenment genealogy shows this is not mere reactionary conservatism but draws on Enlightenment recognition of reason's limits (Hamowy 1987).

Yet critical objections expose fundamental problems with conservative epistemic arguments. Levy (2017) argues that deference to tradition is rational only when traditions result from selection processes that track truth or goodness—but many social traditions lack such reliability-producing pedigrees, shaped instead by power and historical accident. How do we distinguish traditions embodying genuine wisdom from those merely perpetuating contingent arrangements? Goodin and Spiekermann (2018) demonstrate that wisdom-of-crowds arguments fail: complete deference to tradition risks informational cascades where everyone ignores private information to follow precedent, undermining rather than enhancing collective intelligence. The key tension remains unresolved: conservative accounts offer insufficient criteria for distinguishing wisdom-preserving from accident-preserving traditions.

### Communitarian and Virtue Ethics Approaches—Traditions Constitute Identity and Practical Wisdom

Communitarian positions differ crucially from conservative: traditions don't merely preserve wisdom but *constitute* the conditions for identity and practical reasoning. MacIntyre's neo-Aristotelian synthesis and Taylor's expressivist communitarianism provide complementary accounts of tradition's constitutive role.

MacIntyre's central claim—that all rationality is tradition-constituted—challenges both liberal neutrality and conservative reverence (MacIntyre 1988). Different traditions (Aristotelian, Augustinian, liberal) embody incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical reason. Yet this is not relativism: traditions are "living arguments" capable of resolving internal epistemic crises and understanding rivals better than rivals understand themselves. Traditions possess neither intrinsic value independent of rational content nor merely instrumental value as means to independent ends, but *constitutive* value as conditions for rational inquiry itself. MacIntyre's three-level account shows tradition's role at individual, communal, and epistemic levels: virtues are excellences of practices; practices are embedded in traditions; traditions provide narrative unity and *telos* for individual lives (MacIntyre 1981, 1990). This articulates the strongest philosophical case for why traditions are necessary rather than optional frameworks.

Taylor's expressivist communitarianism emphasizes identity formation through recognition within moral communities that provide "horizons of significance" (Taylor 1989, 1994). Modern identity emerged through historical transformations of moral sources embedded in traditions. Traditions provide frameworks for "strong evaluations"—not mere preferences but discriminations of worth requiring cultural-linguistic resources only traditions supply. Authenticity requires tradition rather than opposition to it: genuine self-expression depends on communal frameworks that make certain forms of life recognizable as valuable. The "politics of recognition" extends this framework to multicultural contexts, arguing that identity-constituting traditions merit respect because they enable meaningful self-interpretation.

Phronesis (practical wisdom) exemplifies tradition-embedded virtue formation. Recent empirical work demonstrates this concretely: Darnell et al. (2019) and Kristjánsson et al. (2021) show phronesis integrates moral perception, reasoning, emotion, and motivation in context-sensitive ways developed only through habituation within practices. Conroy et al.'s (2021) study of 131 doctors reveals "collective practical wisdom" emerging through 15 virtue continua, developed via community-based narrative sharing and reflective practice rather than abstract principle-learning. This demonstrates tradition's formative role: practical wisdom cannot be reduced to competency checklists but requires apprenticeship in communities embodying professional excellence (Kim et al. 2023). Medical ethics, professional identity formation, and moral education all depend on tradition-embedded practices that cultivate characteristic virtues through exemplars, habituation, and community participation.

The key tension communitarian accounts face: while MacIntyre and Taylor articulate *how* traditions constitute identity and practical wisdom, they provide limited criteria for distinguishing valuable from harmful constitutive traditions. Not all identity-constituting traditions merit preservation—caste identity, white supremacist traditions, and patriarchal frameworks also constitute identities and enable "practical reasoning" within their terms. The constitutive role itself doesn't determine value.

### Liberal Accommodation and Social Epistemology

Liberal multiculturalism attempts reconciling tradition with autonomy by arguing traditions provide "contexts of choice" essential for meaningful freedom (Kymlicka 1995). Cultural membership is valuable because it enables rather than constrains individual autonomy. Kymlicka distinguishes "external protections" (legitimate defenses of culture against external pressures) from "internal restrictions" (problematic constraints on members' autonomy). This framework suggests traditions are valuable when they support autonomy.

Yet Parekh (1997, 2001) pushes further: cultural diversity may have *intrinsic* value as distinct forms of human flourishing, not merely instrumental value for autonomy. Traditions embody different ways of being human deserving respect on their own terms. Carens (1997) argues liberalism need not be culturally neutral—traditions valuable as frameworks enabling meaningful choice require active support, not mere toleration.

The tension becomes clear: liberal accommodation works only for traditions that actually support autonomy. What about traditions that constrain choice? The framework risks incoherence when traditions' constitutive role conflicts with liberal autonomy values. Carens and Parekh attempt navigating this by distinguishing core liberal commitments from cultural neutrality, but the boundary remains contested.

Social epistemology provides distinct defense of tradition's epistemic value. Coady's (1992) anti-reductionist position establishes testimony as basic knowledge source on par with perception. We have presumptive right to trust testimony without independent verification—extending this to traditional knowledge suggests default entitlement to trust inherited wisdom. Simion's (2020) "testimonial contractarianism" develops this: implicit social contracts whereby speakers comply with knowledge norms and hearers presume compliance. Applied to tradition, if traditional practices operate under norms requiring fidelity to inherited wisdom, participants are rationally entitled to trust by default.

Palermos (2020) advances "distributed virtue reliabilism": epistemic collaborations produce beliefs with positive epistemic standing irreducible to individual members. Traditional practices constitute distributed cognitive systems where knowledge emerges from mutual interactions across generations. The collective cognitive abilities embodied in traditions may exceed what any individual possesses. Müller (2024) analyzes "cumulative cultural knowledge"—traditions paradigmatically preserve knowledge refined over generations through cultural learning (observation, imitation, participation), not just testimonial transmission. Agents deserve epistemic credit for transmitting such knowledge efficiently and safely.

Longino (2022) critiques "thin" sociality in mainstream epistemology, arguing traditions require "thick" social analysis: evidence standards emerge through communal discursive interactions across time, not individual epistemic judgments. This social-processual understanding captures how traditions function as collective epistemic systems.

Yet social epistemology's defense of tradition faces its own limitation: it shows tradition *can* have epistemic value but doesn't address epistemic pathologies—bias, exclusion, credibility deficits for marginalized groups. Fricker's (2007) epistemic injustice framework reveals how traditions perpetuate testimonial injustice (prejudice causes credibility deficits) and hermeneutical injustice (gaps in collective interpretive resources disadvantage marginalized groups). Traditions lacking epistemic legitimacy are those systematically silencing certain voices.

### Political Legitimacy and Democratic Traditions

Constitutional traditions play contested roles in democratic legitimacy. How can inherited constitutional frameworks be legitimate if current citizens had no say in their creation? Rawlsian political liberalism answers through ongoing public justification: constitutional traditions are legitimate not through historical pedigree alone but through continued acceptability to free and equal citizens reasoning with public reason (Langvatn 2024, Michelman 2015).

Michelman (2024) develops sophisticated account requiring citizens to adopt dual perspective—"internal" attitude of bonding to legal tradition combined with "external" critical evaluation of its justifiability. This reflexive stance reconciles inherited constraints with democratic autonomy. Constitutional traditions gain legitimacy through citizens' reflective equilibrium between acceptance of inherited framework and reasoned judgment of its justifiability.

Yet Ferrara (2024) identifies destabilizing problem: extending reasonable pluralism to political conceptions themselves (not just comprehensive doctrines) undermines constitutional stability. If citizens reasonably disagree about liberal principles themselves, constitutional traditions cannot provide stable legitimation. The question deepens: can tradition-based legitimacy withstand pluralism about traditions themselves?

Bellamy's (2007) political constitutionalism offers republican alternative: democratic institutions themselves—elections, legislative deliberation, party competition—provide legitimacy without requiring entrenched constitutional traditions enforced by courts. Democracy is self-legitimating; republican tradition shows democratic processes are sufficient constitutional safeguards. This challenges liberal constitutionalism's assumption that inherited constitutional frameworks are necessary for legitimate democracy.

Christiano (2004) defends democracy's intrinsic value: democratic procedures don't merely produce legitimate outcomes; democracy itself expresses and realizes fundamental equality. Democratic traditions are valuable because they publicly manifest equal respect. This contrasts with purely instrumental justifications—the value lies in what democratic practices *are* (public realization of equality), not merely what they produce.

The tension remains unresolved: political legitimacy theories oscillate between tradition-based (constitutional frameworks) and procedure-based (democratic participation) accounts without consensus on whether democratic traditions have intrinsic or instrumental value.

### Section Summary

Three major philosophical defenses emerge with distinct logics but similar difficulties. Conservative epistemic arguments defend tradition as repository of wisdom but struggle to distinguish wisdom from power and accident. Communitarian virtue ethics articulates tradition's constitutive role in identity and rationality but cannot explain which identity-constituting traditions merit preservation. Liberal accommodation attempts selective endorsement of traditions supporting autonomy but faces incoherence when traditions constrain autonomy. Social epistemology demonstrates tradition's epistemic value through distributed cognition and testimonial reliability but doesn't adequately address epistemic pathologies of exclusion and bias.

All three positions require supplementation by critical analysis distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions. The shared failure suggests that identifying tradition's value requires not choosing between these frameworks but examining how epistemic, constitutive, and justice considerations interact. No single approach captures when traditions are valuable because traditions possess multiple simultaneous value-types that can conflict. This points toward the need for multidimensional analysis—the subject of subsequent critical examination.


## Section 3: Critical Tensions and Objections

If conservative and communitarian defenses of tradition establish *when* traditions may be valuable, feminist, liberal, and postcolonial critiques establish equally clearly *when* they are not. These critical perspectives converge on a fundamental challenge: traditions can function as mechanisms of domination, systematically subordinating vulnerable members while claiming cultural authenticity. The debate reveals an unresolved tension between universal moral standards (required to critique harmful traditions) and respect for cultural particularity (required to avoid imperialism). Neither pure universalism nor relativism succeeds, yet the question of tradition's value cannot avoid this tension.

### The Tradition-Autonomy Tension: Feminist and Liberal Critiques

Susan Okin's "Is multiculturalism bad for women?" articulates the core liberal feminist objection to traditional practices. Most cultures, Okin observes, are patriarchal, and multicultural policies protecting group rights often "come at the expense of women within those groups" (Okin 1999, 25). Forced marriage, polygamy, unequal inheritance, and restricted mobility—practices defended as cultural tradition—systematically subordinate women while the liberal multiculturalist discourse implicitly takes the male perspective as representing "the group," thereby obscuring women's distinct interests. When traditions violate women's autonomy and perpetuate gender inequality, liberal principles should override cultural preservation claims. This establishes a clear boundary condition: traditions lack value when they systematically restrict members' capacity for self-determination, particularly along gender lines.

Yet Okin's framework faces internal difficulties. Lépinard (2011) identifies a dilemma: the autonomous feminist subject capable of rejecting oppressive traditions is itself a culturally-specific liberal construction. Either feminists respect women's choices within cultural contexts—risking endorsement of subordination—or impose external feminist norms, thereby denying agency and reproducing colonial dynamics. The very concept of autonomy presupposed by liberal critique may not adequately capture how women exercise agency within traditional frameworks. Narayan and Harding (2000) extend this postcolonial feminist challenge, arguing that liberal feminist critiques of "Third World" traditions can serve orientalist agendas, essentializing non-Western women as passive victims. Women within traditional communities resist and renegotiate practices through culturally-grounded means, not merely through liberal autonomy.

Godman (2025) offers a recent rebuttal to Okin, arguing that multiculturalism is actually good for women in three ways: alternative frameworks (cosmopolitanism, liberal nationalism) also harm women; much feminist advocacy by minority women occurs *through* their cultural membership, not against it; and cultural diversity has epistemic value for feminist problem-solving. This challenges the simple opposition between tradition and women's interests, suggesting that cultural contexts can provide resources for gender emancipation, not only constraints.

The liberal education debates sharpen this autonomy tension. Franklin-Hall (2021) defends education for rational autonomy against charges that it privileges Enlightenment values over faith. He argues that critical rational reflection is not sectarian but a universal feature of reasoning—teaching children to reason well respects them as reasoning beings. Marples (2005) goes further, contending that faith schools violate children's rights to an "open future" and autonomous development by prioritizing religious tradition over children's developing capacity for independent moral reasoning. Yet Schouten (2018) identifies a problem: political liberalism cannot justify full autonomy education solely on citizenship grounds without perfectionist claims about autonomy's intrinsic value. Such perfectionism conflicts with neutrality among comprehensive doctrines, including religious traditions. If liberalism must embrace perfectionism to critique tradition-based education, it abandons neutrality and imposes contested values.

The tradition-autonomy tension appears intractable. Pure autonomy-maximization ignores how agency operates within cultural contexts and risks cultural imperialism. But accommodation of traditions that constrain autonomy seems to contradict liberal commitments to individual freedom. Neither pole resolves the tension—revealing deep value conflicts rather than philosophical confusion.

### Structural Domination and Oppressive Traditions

Where liberal critiques focus on autonomy, critical theory analyzes how traditions function as systems of structural domination. Iris Marion Young's *Justice and the Politics of Difference* (1990) provides the most influential framework through her "five faces of oppression": exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and systematic violence. Crucially, oppression operates through social structures and cultural meanings embedded in institutions, not merely through individual acts or resource distribution. Traditions become oppressive by institutionalizing these faces of oppression within "normal" social practices that appear natural to dominant groups.

This framework reveals tradition-as-oppression often remains invisible precisely because it is embedded in taken-for-granted cultural meanings. The gendered division of labor, for instance, exploits women's unpaid care work, marginalizes them from public sphere participation, renders them powerless in household decision-making, imposes dominant gender norms as universal (cultural imperialism), and exposes them to domestic violence legitimized by patriarchal authority. Vedder (2023) demonstrates how even Rawls's political liberalism provides resources for critiquing such traditions: gendered care traditions violate fair distribution of primary goods necessary for citizenship. Liberal political tradition's own principles ground transformation of oppressive gendered traditions without requiring comprehensive feminist doctrines.

Alexander's (2006) transnational feminist work exposes a further dimension: colonial powers actively *constructed* new oppressive "traditions" while claiming to preserve authentic culture. Heteronormative regulation of sexuality, often presented as "traditional," frequently represents recent colonial imposition rather than indigenous practice. This challenges simplistic tradition-modernity binaries—critique must recognize how domination *creates* traditions serving power, not merely how it perpetuates ancient customs. Ratele (2013) extends this analysis to African masculinities, showing how invocations of "tradition" to enforce hetero-patriarchy and reject queer sexualities reify static, tribalized notions of culture. African traditions were always dynamic and contested, not monolithic sources of hetero-masculine authority. "Tradition" functions as rhetorical weapon enforcing contemporary oppression while claiming ancient legitimacy.

Ambedkar's approach to caste, as analyzed by George (2024), demonstrates tradition-internal grounds for rejecting oppressive practices. Rather than choosing between tradition and modernity—the false choice that postcolonial scholarship often presents—Ambedkar synthesized modernity's emancipatory potential (individual liberation) with cultural continuity. Wholesale rejection of either tradition or modernity forecloses emancipation. This suggests that traditions possess value when they can incorporate emancipatory elements while maintaining identity, not when preserved unchanged or entirely rejected.

Radhakrishnan's (2025) meta-critique adds methodological complexity: even progressive critical methods like Frankfurt School immanent critique can perpetuate colonial domination by assuming universal validity of particular frameworks. Immanent critique—judging traditions by internal norms—risks inattentiveness to constitutive exclusions of who counts in the community, places asymmetrical burdens on marginalized critics to work within frameworks that marginalize them, and replicates colonial mechanisms through the practice of critique itself. Critique must attend to power relations governing critique, not only criticized practices. This challenges any simple external critique of traditions while acknowledging that tradition-internal critique may reproduce exclusions.

Even liberalism's "progressive" traditions embed structural domination. Rollo (2020) identifies "domination contracts" within social contract theory that exclude those deemed incapable of speech and reason—particularly children and people with intellectual disabilities. The liberal veneration of voice is itself an exclusionary tradition requiring reconceptualization. This exposes how philosophy's canonical traditions contain mechanisms of subordination while claiming universality, complicating any straightforward progressive-traditional binary.

### When Should Traditions Be Abandoned? Normative Criteria

If traditions can be oppressive, under what conditions should they be reformed versus abandoned entirely? Several normative frameworks converge on criteria for tradition-abandonment, though they differ in justificatory basis.

Casal's (2020) "conditional value" thesis, applied to controversial practices like whaling and bullfighting, holds that traditions possess value through contributions to social cohesion and cultural meaning, but these cannot override weightier moral considerations. Tradition provides *prima facie* reasons, not decisive ones. When practices cause unjustified harm to sentient beings or perpetuate injustice, traditional status does not immunize them from moral criticism.

Earp (2016) develops a consistency principle for evaluating traditional practices across cultures. Western debates on female genital cutting/mutilation fall into either relativism (all cultural practices equal) or hypocrisy (condemning African practices while accepting comparable Western procedures like cosmetic genital surgery and routine male circumcision). Consistent ethical principles—harm, consent, autonomy—must apply cross-culturally. Practices should be evaluated by universal standards while acknowledging that application requires cultural sensitivity and without selective condemnation of "other" cultures.

Letourneau and Pigeon (2023) apply an "acceptability test" to culinary traditions: practices involving unnecessary suffering or environmental damage fail ethical justification regardless of traditional status. Cultural practices causing cruelty or ecological harm—they examine dog meat industry in South Korea—cannot be defended by appeals to cultural embeddedness. This demonstrates that tradition-as-justification has limits; traditional pedigree does not exempt practices from ethical evaluation by standards of harm and sustainability.

Fricker's (2007) epistemic injustice framework extends critique to epistemic traditions. Traditions become problematic when they perpetuate testimonial injustice (prejudice causes credibility deficits for certain groups) or hermeneutical injustice (gaps in collective interpretive resources systematically disadvantage marginalized groups). Epistemic traditions that silence certain voices lack epistemic legitimacy. Vaditya (2018) develops this into "methodology of the oppressed"—traditions of knowledge production perpetuate subordination by treating dominant groups' knowledge as objective. Critique requires centering marginalized epistemic standpoints.

Naudts (2024) demonstrates how Young's oppression framework applies to emerging digital traditions. Algorithmic governance and data-driven decision-making systems introduce new faces of oppression—marginalizing users, rendering them powerless, perpetuating existing subordination through automated processes. This shows that tradition-critique must be dynamic, addressing emergent as well as ancient forms of domination. Even nascent technological "traditions" may require abandonment if their trajectory leads to structural subordination.

From these analyses, several normative criteria for tradition-abandonment emerge:

1. **Harm principle**: Traditions causing unnecessary suffering to humans or sentient beings without compensating moral value warrant abandonment when less harmful alternatives exist.

2. **Autonomy constraint**: Traditions systematically restricting members' capacity for self-determination—particularly when exit is costly or impossible—violate conditions of legitimate authority.

3. **Justice requirement**: Traditions perpetuating unfair distribution of social goods or institutionalizing group subordination through any of Young's five faces of oppression fail justice conditions.

4. **Epistemic legitimacy**: Traditions systematically excluding or silencing certain voices through testimonial or hermeneutical injustice lack epistemic standing.

5. **Consistency principle**: Evaluative standards must apply cross-culturally without hypocrisy or selective condemnation based on cultural origin.

Yet application of these criteria raises the unresolved tension: How do we apply universal principles without cultural imperialism? Postcolonial critiques (Narayan and Harding 2000; Radhakrishnan 2025; Alexander 2006) demonstrate that even ostensibly universal standards can serve domination. Liberal feminist critiques of non-Western traditions have served orientalist agendas. Immanent critique reproduces colonial frameworks. The very distinction between "universal" and "particular" may encode Western assumptions.

Nor can we retreat to pure relativism. As Earp demonstrates, relativism about harmful practices becomes morally intolerable—it would forbid criticism of any traditional subordination. The debate exposes a productive but unresolved tension: universal moral standards are necessary to critique harmful traditions, but their application always occurs within power relations that may reproduce domination. Neither pure universalism nor relativism succeeds. This may be a permanent feature of tradition-evaluation rather than a solvable problem—requiring phronetic judgment attending to particular contexts, power relations, and insider perspectives rather than algorithmic application of principles.

The critical literature establishes clearly that traditions *can* lack value—when they perpetuate structural domination, violate autonomy without sufficient justification, cause unjustified harm, or systematically exclude voices. But *how* to distinguish valuable from harmful traditions without reproducing domination through the very act of critique remains philosophically and practically contested. The research question "when are traditions valuable?" cannot be answered without confronting this tension between universal standards and cultural particularity, between external critique and internal reform, between respecting agency and preventing subordination.


## Research Gaps and Synthesis

The preceding review has traced the philosophical landscape of tradition's value across conservative, communitarian, liberal, and critical frameworks. Each position captures essential but partial truths about when and why traditions matter. This section identifies systematic gaps in the literature and develops an integrative synthesis answering the project's central question: when are traditions valuable?

### Systematic Research Gaps

**Gap 1: Operationalizing "Living" vs. "Dead" Traditions**

Beckstein (2017) provides the most systematic conceptual distinction between living traditions (characterized by continuity, active practice, internal contestation, critical reflection, and adaptive capacity) and dead or ossified traditions. Yet the literature lacks methodological frameworks for empirically assessing these criteria in specific traditions. Conservative and communitarian defenses often assume the traditions they defend are "living" without demonstration—Burke's appeal to British constitutional tradition, MacIntyre's privileging of Aristotelian-Thomistic virtue ethics, Taylor's embrace of expressivist authenticity all take for granted that these traditions exhibit vitality rather than merely historical persistence. Conversely, liberal critics may dismiss traditions as "ossified" without examining their internal dynamics or capacity for self-correction.

The gap is particularly acute because the distinction matters normatively. If only living traditions generate special normative force, we need rigorous criteria for assessment. What counts as "internal contestation"—does it require formal institutional mechanisms for debate, or can informal resistance suffice? How do we measure "adaptive capacity" without simply equating it with conformity to liberal values? When does continuity become mere inertia? The literature provides conceptual categories but insufficient guidance for applying them to actual traditions, whether political constitutions, religious practices, professional standards, or cultural customs.

**Gap 2: Conditions for Tradition-Internal vs. Tradition-External Critique**

Radhakrishnan (2025) identifies a fundamental methodological problem: immanent critique (judging traditions by their internal standards) risks reproducing the very exclusions being criticized, while external critique risks cultural imperialism and epistemological domination. The literature oscillates between these positions without principled frameworks for navigation. MacIntyre's criterion that rational traditions must understand rival traditions better than those rivals understand themselves remains underdeveloped—how do we know when a tradition achieves such superior understanding versus merely asserting it? When does outsider critique constitute legitimate exposure of contradictions versus imposition of alien standards?

This gap has profound practical implications. Feminist critiques of patriarchal traditions (Okin 1999) claim to expose internal contradictions—that traditions professing human dignity simultaneously subordinate women—but traditionalists reject this as external liberal imposition. Postcolonial critics (Narayan and Harding 2000, Alexander 2006) note that "internal" critique can reproduce colonial dynamics when critics adopt Western frameworks. The Ambedkar synthesis (George 2024) suggests partial resolution through critical appropriation of both tradition and modernity, but the literature lacks systematic theory of when cross-tradition criticism is legitimate.

What principles govern the boundary between legitimate external critique and illegitimate cultural imperialism? Must critics demonstrate insider status, and if so, how is such status established? Can traditions be criticized for failing to live up to standards they themselves don't recognize? The debate between liberal universalism and cultural relativism remains unresolved because these underlying methodological questions receive insufficient attention.

**Gap 3: Pluralism About Tradition's Value-Types**

The literature treats traditions as possessing single value-types—epistemic (conservative arguments), constitutive (MacIntyrean virtue ethics), or instrumental (liberal multiculturalism)—but actual traditions likely possess multiple simultaneous value-types that can conflict. Constitutional traditions illustrate the complexity: they may have epistemic value (accumulated legal wisdom about institutional design), constitutive value (structuring political identity and shared frameworks of meaning), instrumental value (coordinating citizen expectations and enabling stable governance), and potentially intrinsic value (embodying justice ideals worthy of preservation regardless of consequences). When these value-dimensions pull in opposite directions—when constitutional wisdom conflicts with democratic inclusion, or when identity-constitution requires practices that violate autonomy—how should we adjudicate?

Wall (2016) distinguishes epistemic, practical, and expressive authority, and Kumar (2019) proposes "framework value" to capture how traditions structure evaluative space. Yet the literature lacks systematic frameworks for analyzing value-pluralism within single traditions. Scheffler's (2010) "conditional value" thesis suggests traditions' worth depends on their effects, but this collapses multiple value-types into instrumental calculation. The conservative epistemic defense, communitarian constitutive argument, and liberal conditional thesis each emphasize different values without acknowledging that traditions simultaneously instantiate multiple goods.

This gap matters because value-conflicts cannot be resolved without understanding which values are at stake. When does tradition's epistemic reliability outweigh its constraints on autonomy? When should identity-constituting traditions be reformed despite the disruption to communal meaning? The literature's tendency to reduce tradition to single value-types prevents nuanced analysis of such tradeoffs.

**Gap 4: Tradition's Temporal Dynamics and Historical Change**

Most literature analyzes traditions synchronically—examining their structure and value at a particular time—rather than diachronically across developmental trajectories. But tradition is inherently temporal; it *is* transmission and transformation across time. How does tradition's value change as social conditions evolve? When does continuity become ossification? When does adaptive change become dissolution? MacIntyre's concept of "epistemic crises" hints at dynamic analysis—living traditions successfully navigate crises by developing new conceptual resources while maintaining narrative continuity—but this remains underdeveloped.

The gap affects both theoretical understanding and practical judgment. Theoretically, we lack accounts of tradition-transformation distinguishing evolution from abandonment. What makes a reformed practice still "the same tradition" rather than replacement? Practically, the gap leaves us unable to assess when traditions successfully adapt versus when they stagnate or collapse. Bellamy's (2007) political constitutionalism assumes democratic traditions are self-correcting, but provides limited analysis of correction mechanisms. Jones (2020) critiques constitutional traditions for encouraging passivity, but doesn't examine whether some constitutional traditions exhibit more vitality than others.

Recent work on professional medical ethics (Conroy et al. 2021, Kristjánsson 2022) shows how phronesis develops through apprenticeship within evolving practices, suggesting traditions maintain identity through continuity of aims despite changing methods. Yet systematic theory of tradition-temporality remains absent. We need accounts explaining how traditions preserve wisdom across changing circumstances, how they incorporate new members while maintaining standards, and how they balance stability with responsiveness.

**Gap 5: Non-Western Traditions and Cross-Cultural Comparison**

Despite scattered examples—Ubuntu ethics (Dreyer 2015), Confucian meritocracy (Li 2020), African palaver (Ingiyimbere 2022), Yoruba epistemology (Janvid 2021), Islamic intellectual heritage (Faruque 2024), Bantu cosmology (Chirindo and Mutua 2024)—the literature remains predominantly Western-centric in both traditions studied and conceptual frameworks employed. MacIntyre's paradigm is Aristotelian-Thomistic virtue ethics; Taylor's is modern Western expressivism; even critics like Okin and Young work primarily within Western liberal-democratic contexts. Cross-cultural work often remains comparative (examining "Rawls and African palaver," "Confucianism and democracy") rather than genuinely pluralistic, analyzing non-Western traditions through Western conceptual lenses.

This gap matters epistemically and politically. Epistemically, Western-centrism limits our understanding of tradition's diverse forms and functions. Do non-Western traditions exhibit different relationships between continuity and change, authority and critique, individual and community? Politically, the gap risks reproducing colonial dynamics where Western philosophical frameworks become universal standards for evaluating all traditions. Radhakrishnan's (2025) critique of Frankfurt School methods' potential coloniality applies more broadly: even progressive Western frameworks may perpetuate domination when treated as universal.

Recent postcolonial and decolonial work (Narayan and Harding 2000, Alexander 2006, George 2024) challenges Western-centric assumptions, but remains reactive rather than constructive. We need expanded engagement with non-Western philosophical traditions on their own terms—not merely as comparison cases for Western theory but as alternative frameworks for understanding tradition's value. What would theory of tradition look like developed from Ubuntu, Confucian, or Islamic starting points rather than Aristotelian or liberal foundations?

**Gap 6: Digital/Technological Change and Tradition**

Minimal systematic engagement exists with how digital culture affects traditional practices, despite profound transformations in how communities form, knowledge transmits, and authority functions. Chambers (2020) examines fake news threatening deliberative traditions, Naudts (2024) extends Young's oppression framework to algorithmic systems, and Sparrow (2023) analyzes how AI creates novel forms of domination. Yet these remain isolated interventions rather than systematic treatment of tradition in technologically-mediated societies.

The gap encompasses several questions. Can traditions survive digitalization of social life? Traditional practices often depend on embodied co-presence, apprenticeship through participation, and slow intergenerational transmission—all threatened by digital mediation, algorithmic curation, and accelerated cultural change. Do new technologies create new "traditions" rapidly enough to generate normative force? If tradition requires temporal depth and tested experience, can emerging technological practices (open-source development, online community norms) constitute genuine traditions or merely novel conventions? How does algorithmic mediation affect tradition-transmission when content curation shapes what knowledge is preserved and transmitted?

These questions matter because digital transformation is not optional—it fundamentally restructures the conditions under which traditions operate. The literature's focus on pre-digital traditions may miss how technology enables new forms of collective memory, distributed cognition, and cultural learning (Müller 2024, Palermos 2020). Conversely, it may underestimate how digitalization disrupts the embodied, place-based, temporally-extended character essential to tradition's normative force.

### Integrative Synthesis: When Are Traditions Valuable?

The literature review reveals that tradition's value is irreducibly *conditional* and *plural*. No single framework—conservative epistemic, communitarian constitutive, or liberal critical—adequately captures when traditions are valuable because traditions possess multiple value-types operating simultaneously and their worth depends on contextual factors. The question "when are traditions valuable?" cannot receive algorithmic answers but requires phronetic judgment attending to particular circumstances.

**Proposed Integrative Framework**

Traditions are valuable when they satisfy conditions across three dimensions simultaneously:

**I. Epistemic Conditions (Conservative Insight)**

Traditions have epistemic value when they:
1. Result from reliability-conferring selection processes rather than mere historical accident or power consolidation (Levy 2017)
2. Encode distributed tacit knowledge unavailable to individuals through Hayekian spontaneous order (Reimers 2021, Hamowy 1987) or Oakeshottian practical wisdom (Wendland 2023, Marsh 2010)
3. Preserve cumulative cultural knowledge refined across generations through observation, imitation, and participation, not merely testimonial transmission (Müller 2024)
4. Maintain epistemic practices that don't systematically exclude voices through testimonial or hermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007)
5. Exhibit "living" rather than "dead" character through ongoing critical reflection and internal contestation (Beckstein 2017)

*Critical constraint*: Epistemic deference to tradition is warranted only with evidence of reliability-producing causal histories. Longevity alone insufficient—many oppressive traditions persist through power rather than wisdom (Young 1990, Alexander 2006). As Goodin and Spiekermann (2018) demonstrate, complete deference risks informational cascades where everyone ignores private information to follow precedent, undermining the very wisdom-aggregation conservatives celebrate.

**II. Constitutive Conditions (Communitarian Insight)**

Traditions have constitutive value when they:
1. Provide frameworks for meaningful identity formation without foreclosing autonomy—enabling rather than constraining agency (Taylor 1989, Kymlicka 1995)
2. Enable development of practical wisdom (phronesis) through participation in practices that cultivate moral perception, reasoning, emotion, and motivation in integrated ways (MacIntyre 1981, Darnell et al. 2019, Kristjánsson et al. 2021)
3. Structure the "space of reasons" for rational discourse, establishing what counts as reason, what requires justification, and what can be taken for granted (Giovagnoli 2019)
4. Constitute communities of inquiry capable of self-criticism and development through dialectical engagement with rivals (MacIntyre 1988, D'Andrea 2006)
5. Transmit not merely propositional knowledge but experiential understanding through apprenticeship, habituation, and shared participation (Conroy et al. 2021, Kim et al. 2023)

*Critical constraint*: Constitutive role doesn't immunize traditions from moral criticism. Not all identity-constituting traditions merit preservation—traditions constituting white supremacist identity, patriarchal gender roles, or caste hierarchy are valuable to participants yet morally problematic (Okin 1999, George 2024, Ratele 2013). The fact that practices constitute identity explains their psychological power and resistance to change but doesn't establish their value.

**III. Justice Conditions (Liberal-Critical Insight)**

Traditions are valuable only when they:
1. Don't perpetuate structural domination via Young's (1990) five faces of oppression—exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and systematic violence
2. Respect autonomy sufficiently to allow meaningful exit and internal voice, enabling members to contest practices without abandoning community membership (Song 2007)
3. Distribute social goods fairly without systematic group subordination based on gender, race, caste, disability, or other morally arbitrary characteristics (Vedder 2023, Rollo 2020)
4. Remain compatible with democratic equality and inclusion, not requiring "domination contracts" that exclude certain groups from full participation (Gowder 2019, Christiano 2004)
5. Subject practices causing suffering to justification by consistent ethical principles applied cross-culturally, avoiding both relativism (all cultural practices equal) and hypocrisy (condemning others' practices while accepting comparable harms) (Earp 2016, Letourneau and Pigeon 2023)

*Critical constraint*: Tradition's epistemic or constitutive value cannot override justice requirements. When traditions violate these conditions, they should be reformed or abandoned regardless of their wisdom-preserving or identity-constituting functions. As Casal (2020) argues regarding whaling and bullfighting, tradition provides *prima facie* reasons for preservation but these are defeasible—outweighed by weightier moral considerations including harm to sentient beings and perpetuation of injustice.

**Synthesis of Major Positions**

This framework integrates rather than replaces existing positions:

*Conservative epistemic arguments* (Robson 2025, Levy 2017, Oakeshott via Wendland 2023, Hayek via Reimers 2021) are *partially correct*: traditions can preserve distributed wisdom and solve information problems through spontaneous order. But this is conditional on reliability-producing causal histories. Many traditions lack such pedigrees, shaped instead by power, accident, or processes unrelated to truth-tracking (Honderich 2018, Bourke 2018). The Burkean case succeeds only for traditions demonstrably selected for epistemic reliability, not tradition-as-such.

*Communitarian constitutive arguments* (MacIntyre 1981, 1988, Taylor 1989, 1994) are *partially correct*: traditions structure identity, rationality, and practical wisdom development in ways that cannot be reduced to individual choice or instrumental calculation. Traditions aren't merely means to independent ends but conditions for meaningful agency itself. However, constitutive role doesn't determine value. Oppressive traditions also constitute identity—caste constitutes Brahmin and Dalit identities, patriarchy constitutes gendered subjectivities, racism constitutes racial consciousness. That traditions are constitutive explains their power but doesn't justify preservation (George 2024).

*Liberal conditional value arguments* (Scheffler 2010, Casal 2020, Kymlicka 1995) are *partially correct*: tradition's value depends on compatibility with autonomy, justice, and human flourishing. Traditions should be evaluated by their effects on members' wellbeing and capacity for self-determination. But pure autonomy-maximization ignores how agency operates within cultural contexts (Lépinard 2011). As Godman (2025) demonstrates responding to Okin, cultural traditions can support rather than merely constrain women's equality—feminist advocacy often happens through cultural membership, and cultural diversity has epistemic value for feminism. The liberal framework succeeds in establishing necessary conditions (justice, autonomy-respect) but insufficient for complete account of value.

**The Ambedkar Synthesis**

George's (2024) analysis of Ambedkar provides productive resolution: rather than choosing between tradition and modernity, engage in critical appropriation of both. Traditions are valuable when they incorporate emancipatory elements (individual liberation, rational critique, equality) while maintaining cultural continuity and communal identity. This avoids both uncritical preservation (conservative traditionalism) and wholesale rejection (liberal modernism).

Applied to the framework: valuable traditions satisfy all three dimensions—epistemically reliable, constitutively meaningful, and compatible with justice. When traditions fail justice conditions, they require transformation incorporating emancipatory principles rather than mere preservation or complete abandonment. The caste system illustrates the point: Ambedkar rejected caste tradition as fundamentally unjust despite its constitutive role in Indian identity and claimed ancient wisdom, yet he sought transformation through critical appropriation of both Buddhist tradition and modern constitutional equality rather than simple Westernization.

**Unresolved Productive Tension**

The literature cannot fully resolve the tension between universal moral standards (needed to critique harmful traditions) and cultural particularity (needed to avoid imperialism). This may be *productive* tension rather than solvable problem. Liberal universalists insist on universal human rights standards applicable cross-culturally (Okin 1999, Earp 2016), while postcolonial theorists expose how universalism serves Western hegemony (Narayan and Harding 2000, Radhakrishnan 2025, Alexander 2006). Neither pure universalism nor pure relativism succeeds.

The framework acknowledges this tension rather than resolving it algorithmically. Justice conditions establish universal constraints (no domination, respect autonomy, fair distribution), but their application requires contextual judgment attending to power relations, insider perspectives, and cultural meanings. As Radhakrishnan demonstrates, even progressive critical methods can perpetuate colonial domination if they claim universal validity without examining their own cultural situatedness. Practical wisdom (phronesis) is required for case-by-case navigation—no universal algorithm suffices for determining when traditions are valuable.

This productive tension explains persistent disagreement: Okin and Godman, Levy and Robson, MacIntyre and Scheffler aren't simply confused about facts but emphasize different values (autonomy vs. community, universal justice vs. cultural particularity, individual rights vs. collective goods). The question "when are traditions valuable?" inherently involves value-tradeoffs that reasonable people weigh differently.

### Implications for Future Research

**Methodological Implications**

Tradition evaluation requires mixed methods combining:
1. Philosophical analysis of normative value-claims and conceptual distinctions
2. Historical investigation of causal genealogies to assess reliability-producing versus power-serving origins
3. Ethnographic engagement with insider perspectives to understand constitutive meanings
4. Critical attention to structural power relations and whose interests traditions serve

Single-perspective approaches prove insufficient. Pure philosophy risks abstraction from actual traditions' messy reality; pure history describes development without normative evaluation; pure ethnography risks uncritical insider capture; pure critique risks external imposition. Integrated methods respect tradition as simultaneously normative (having value-claims), historical (developed over time), social (constituting communities), and political (embedded in power relations).

**Theoretical Priorities**

Six priorities emerge from identified gaps:

1. Develop rigorous criteria for assessing tradition vitality (living vs. dead), including empirical indicators of internal contestation, adaptive capacity, critical reflection, and responsiveness to epistemic crises

2. Articulate systematic theory of legitimate cross-tradition criticism, specifying when external critique constitutes exposure of contradictions versus cultural imperialism, and what insider/outsider status means for critique's legitimacy

3. Analyze value-pluralism within traditions, developing frameworks for adjudicating when different value-types (epistemic, constitutive, instrumental, intrinsic) conflict and how to weigh competing goods

4. Examine tradition's temporal dynamics diachronically, explaining conditions for successful adaptation versus ossification, and distinguishing evolution from dissolution

5. Expand engagement with non-Western traditions philosophically, treating diverse cultural frameworks as alternative starting points for theorizing rather than merely comparison cases for Western theories

6. Address tradition in technologically-mediated contexts, examining how digitalization affects transmission, whether new technological practices constitute traditions, and how algorithmic mediation shapes cultural learning

**Practical Applications**

The framework provides resources for adjudicating real disputes about specific traditions:

*Constitutional reform*: Evaluate inherited constitutional frameworks by all three dimensions. Do they preserve accumulated institutional wisdom (epistemic)? Do they constitute shared political identity (constitutive)? Do they ensure democratic equality and inclusion (justice)? Michelman's (2024) dual perspective—internal bonding combined with external critical judgment—operationalizes this approach.

*Cultural heritage preservation*: Distinguish practices worth preserving (satisfy all three conditions) from those requiring transformation (fail justice conditions despite epistemic or constitutive value) versus abandonment (fail all conditions or cause severe harm). Casal's (2020) conditional value analysis models this reasoning.

*Multicultural education*: Balance transmission of cultural traditions (constitutive value) with development of critical autonomy (justice condition) and epistemic reliability (avoiding perpetuation of falsehoods). Franklin-Hall's (2021) defense of rational autonomy education shows how critical reflection respects children as reasoning beings while Schouten (2018) reveals tensions requiring explicit value-judgments.

*Professional ethics formation*: Recognize that phronesis develops through practice-embedded apprenticeship (constitutive dimension) while ensuring professional traditions don't perpetuate exclusion or epistemic injustice (justice dimension). Medical ethics literature (Conroy et al. 2021, Kotzee et al. 2017) demonstrates this integration.

*Democratic institutional design*: Assess whether inherited democratic practices genuinely support equality (Christiano 2004) or constitute "democratic silence" excluding marginalized voices (Rollo 2020). Political constitutionalism (Bellamy 2007) versus judicial review (Freeman 1990) debate illustrates competing assessments of which institutional traditions best serve democratic values.

The framework doesn't provide determinate answers—practical wisdom remains necessary—but it clarifies what questions to ask and what considerations matter. Tradition evaluation requires examining epistemic reliability, constitutive meaning, and justice simultaneously rather than reducing value to single dimension.

### Conclusion

Tradition's value is conditional on satisfying epistemic, constitutive, and justice requirements simultaneously. Major philosophical positions each capture partial truth: conservatives rightly emphasize epistemic benefits of accumulated wisdom but overlook how power shapes traditions; communitarians rightly recognize constitutive importance for identity and rationality but can't explain which identity-constituting traditions merit preservation; liberals rightly insist on autonomy and justice but risk cultural imperialism and underestimate communal dimensions of agency.

No algorithmic solution exists to "when are traditions valuable?"—this is itself a significant philosophical finding. Traditions simultaneously embody wisdom and domination, enable identity and constrain autonomy, provide epistemic resources and perpetuate injustice. Their evaluation requires practical wisdom attending to particular contexts, historical genealogies, power relations, and multiple value-dimensions.

The unresolved tension between universal moral standards and cultural particularity is productive rather than problematic—it reflects genuine value-conflicts requiring case-by-case judgment rather than general rules. Future research should develop more sophisticated tools for such judgments: operationalizing living/dead distinctions, theorizing legitimate cross-tradition critique, analyzing value-pluralism, examining temporal dynamics, engaging non-Western frameworks, and addressing technological mediation. By synthesizing epistemic, constitutive, and justice dimensions, philosophy can move beyond sterile debates between tradition-defenders and tradition-critics toward nuanced analysis of which traditions, under what conditions, possess which kinds of value.


## Conclusion

The philosophical literature on tradition's value reveals a complex dialectic that resists simple resolution. Traditions are simultaneously repositories of accumulated wisdom (Robson 2025; Oakeshott via Wendland 2023; Hayek via Reimers 2021), constitutive frameworks enabling identity and practical rationality (MacIntyre 1988; Taylor 1989), and potential mechanisms of domination perpetuating structural injustice (Young 1990; Okin 1999; Alexander 2006). The central finding of this review is that tradition's value is irreducibly **conditional** and **plural**—no single theoretical framework adequately answers "when are traditions valuable?" because traditions possess multiple simultaneous value-types whose significance varies contextually.

**Main Finding: Three-Dimensional Conditionality**

Conservative epistemic arguments reveal that traditions can preserve distributed practical wisdom exceeding individual reason (Robson 2025), but only when traditions result from reliability-producing selection processes rather than mere historical accident or entrenched power (Levy 2017). The Burkean case for epistemic deference thus holds **conditionally**: Oakeshott's practical knowledge embedded in traditions (Wendland 2023) and Hayek's spontaneous order encoding dispersed tacit knowledge (Reimers 2021) generate epistemic value when—and only when—traditions have causal histories that track truth or goodness. Goodin and Spiekermann's (2018) demonstration that complete deference risks informational cascades reveals the epistemic limits of traditionalism. Epistemic value is real but bounded.

Communitarian constitutive arguments establish that traditions structure identity formation (Taylor 1989) and enable development of phronesis—practical wisdom integrating perception, reasoning, emotion, and motivation in context-sensitive ways (Darnell et al. 2019; Kristjánsson et al. 2021). MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality shows how all inquiry operates within inherited frameworks providing the conceptual resources for rational discourse itself (MacIntyre 1988; D'Andrea 2006). Conroy et al.'s (2021) empirical study of 131 doctors demonstrates "collective practical wisdom" emerging through tradition-embedded professional communities, confirming that traditions cultivate capacities no individual could develop in isolation. Yet communitarian arguments face a critical limitation: **constitutive role does not determine value**. Not all identity-constituting traditions merit preservation—traditions constituting white supremacist identity or caste-based subordination (George 2024) demonstrate that constitutive function is insufficient for legitimacy.

Liberal-critical positions reveal traditions' dark side: systematic subordination of women (Okin 1999; Lépinard 2011), perpetuation of structural oppression through Young's (1990) five faces (exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, violence), and epistemic injustice silencing marginalized voices (Fricker 2007; Vaditya 2018). Feminist critiques demonstrate that tradition-talk often masks patriarchal power while claiming cultural authenticity (Okin 1999). Postcolonial analyses reveal how colonial powers actively constructed new "traditions" serving domination while presenting them as ancient customs (Alexander 2006; Ratele 2013). The liberal case establishes that traditions are valuable **only when** they respect autonomy sufficiently to allow meaningful exit and internal voice (Song 2007), distribute primary goods fairly without systematic group subordination (Vedder 2023), and remain compatible with democratic equality (Christiano 2004; Gowder 2019). Tradition's epistemic or constitutive value cannot override justice requirements.

**Proposed Integrative Framework**

Traditions are valuable when they satisfy conditions across three dimensions simultaneously:

**I. Epistemic Conditions** (Conservative Insight): Traditions have epistemic value when they (1) result from reliability-conferring selection processes, not mere longevity (Levy 2017); (2) encode distributed tacit knowledge through cultural learning across generations (Müller 2024; Palermos 2020); (3) maintain epistemic practices avoiding systematic exclusion (Fricker 2007; Longino 2022). Epistemic deference is warranted only with evidence of reliability-producing causal histories.

**II. Constitutive Conditions** (Communitarian Insight): Traditions have constitutive value when they (1) provide frameworks for meaningful identity formation without foreclosing autonomy (Taylor 1989; Kymlicka 1995); (2) enable development of practical wisdom through participation in practices embodying excellence (MacIntyre 1981; Jagannathan 2024); (3) constitute communities of inquiry capable of self-criticism—Beckstein's (2017) "living traditions" combining continuity with internal contestation and adaptive capacity. Constitutive role does not immunize from moral criticism.

**III. Justice Conditions** (Liberal-Critical Insight): Traditions are valuable **only when** they (1) do not perpetuate structural domination via Young's (1990) oppression framework; (2) respect autonomy through exit rights and internal voice (Song 2007; Franklin-Hall 2021); (3) distribute social goods fairly without systematic group subordination (Vedder 2023; Casal 2020); (4) remain compatible with democratic equality and inclusion (Christiano 2004; Gowder 2019; Langvatn 2024). Justice conditions constrain epistemic and constitutive value—no tradition is valuable when it violates these requirements.

**The Ambedkar Synthesis**

Rather than choosing between tradition and modernity, George's (2024) analysis of Ambedkar reveals a third path: **critical appropriation of both**. Traditions are valuable when they incorporate emancipatory elements while maintaining cultural continuity, avoiding both uncritical preservation and wholesale rejection. This synthesis challenges the sterile binary between tradition-defenders and tradition-critics. Ambedkar's caste critique demonstrates that grounds for rejecting oppressive traditions can emerge from within affected communities, not merely external imposition. Godman's (2025) recent defense shows that multiculturalism can be good for women because feminist advocacy often works *through* cultural membership, not merely against it. These interventions suggest tradition's value lies in **dynamic transformation** rather than static preservation.

**Unresolved Productive Tension**

The literature cannot fully resolve the tension between universal moral standards (necessary to critique harmful traditions like caste, gender subordination, or slavery) and cultural particularity (necessary to avoid imperialism and respect diverse forms of human flourishing). Radhakrishnan's (2025) decolonial critique reveals that even immanent critical methods can perpetuate colonial domination by assuming universal validity of particular frameworks. This tension may be a **productive feature** rather than a solvable problem. Practical wisdom (phronesis) developed through tradition-embedded experience enables case-by-case navigation that no abstract algorithm can replicate (Darnell et al. 2019; Kristjánsson et al. 2021). The question "when are traditions valuable?" cannot receive a simple algorithmic answer—this is itself a significant philosophical finding.

**Critical Research Gaps**

Six systematic gaps constrain current understanding: (1) **Operationalizing vitality**: Beckstein's (2017) conceptual distinction between living and dead traditions needs empirical criteria for assessing continuity, active practice, internal contestation, critical reflection, and adaptive capacity; (2) **Cross-tradition criticism**: No principled framework exists for determining when tradition-external critique is legitimate versus when it becomes domination (Radhakrishnan 2025); (3) **Value pluralism**: Literature treats traditions as having single value-types, but traditions simultaneously possess epistemic, constitutive, instrumental, and possibly intrinsic value that can conflict—mechanisms for adjudication remain under-theorized; (4) **Temporal dynamics**: Most analyses are synchronic rather than diachronic, yet tradition *is* transmission across time—how traditions successfully navigate social change while maintaining identity requires systematic treatment; (5) **Non-Western engagement**: Despite scattered examples (Ubuntu, Confucianism, African palaver, Islamic adab), literature remains Western-centric in both traditions studied and frameworks employed; (6) **Digital transformation**: Minimal engagement with how digital culture and algorithmic mediation affect traditional practices and transmission (though Naudts 2024 begins addressing algorithmic oppression).

**Expected Contribution**

By synthesizing epistemic, constitutive, and justice dimensions, this integrative framework moves beyond sterile debates between tradition-defenders and tradition-critics toward nuanced analysis of *which* traditions, under *what* conditions, possess *which kinds* of value. The framework reveals that answering "when are traditions valuable?" requires multidimensional analysis combining philosophical clarity about value-types, historical understanding of causal genealogies, ethnographic engagement with insider perspectives, and critical attention to structural power relations. No single disciplinary approach—pure philosophy, pure history, pure sociology—suffices to evaluate traditions adequately.

The question itself proves more complex than it initially appears. Tradition-evaluation cannot be algorithmic but requires phronetic judgment attending to particular contexts while remaining accountable to universal justice requirements. This complexity is not a failure of philosophical analysis but reflects the genuine difficulty of balancing universal moral standards with cultural particularity, epistemic humility with critical scrutiny, respect for inherited wisdom with openness to emancipatory transformation. Traditions matter—but how they matter, and when, demands careful case-by-case analysis rather than wholesale endorsement or rejection.
