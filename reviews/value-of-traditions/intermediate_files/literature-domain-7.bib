DOMAIN: Critical Limitations and Pathologies of Traditions
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-08
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 (High: 6, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain represents the critical counter-tradition to valorizations of tradition,
examining when and how traditions become oppressive, unjust, or harmful. The literature
spans feminist philosophy's critique of patriarchal traditions (particularly Okin's
seminal work on multiculturalism and women's rights), postcolonial theory's analysis
of colonial cultural domination (including debates between tradition and modernity in
postcolonial contexts), and critical race theory's exposure of how traditions perpetuate
racial subordination. Three central debates structure this field: (1) the tension between
cultural relativism and universal human rights, particularly regarding gender oppression;
(2) the mechanisms by which traditions function as systems of domination (Iris Marion
Young's "five faces of oppression" framework has been highly influential); and (3) the
conditions under which traditions should be reformed or abandoned entirely. Recent work
(2020-2025) extends these critiques to digital capitalism, algorithmic domination, and
contemporary forms of epistemic violence, showing how traditional forms of subordination
adapt to new technological contexts.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential for answering the research project's central question of WHEN
traditions are valuable by establishing the negative cases—when they are not. It provides
the normative criteria for distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions: traditions
become problematic when they perpetuate domination, subordination, epistemic marginalization,
or restrict autonomy without sufficient justification. The feminist and postcolonial
critiques particularly illuminate how traditions can function as mechanisms of power that
entrench inequality while claiming cultural authenticity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the domain is rich in critiques of Western colonial traditions and patriarchal
traditions, there is less systematic treatment of when non-Western traditions may be
harmful from within their own cultural contexts. The debate often remains at the level
of universalism vs. relativism rather than developing more nuanced frameworks for
tradition-internal critique. Also, the conditions for successful tradition transformation
(rather than abandonment) receive less attention than the critique itself.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should position this domain in dialectical relationship with domains
emphasizing tradition's value. Key questions: What makes some traditions oppressive while
others enhance flourishing? Can traditions be reformed from within or must they be
abandoned? How do power relations within traditions differ from those between traditions?
The Okin debate and Young's oppression framework provide particularly useful analytical
tools for this synthesis.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Feminist critique (8 papers): Traditions often encode patriarchal domination; women's
  autonomy requires critical examination of cultural practices
- Postcolonial critique (5 papers): Colonial traditions imposed domination while
  indigenous traditions were dismissed; but postcolonial nationalism can also reinscribe
  oppressive traditions
- Critical race theory (3 papers): Traditions function as "domination contracts" that
  exclude racialized groups
- Structural domination (4 papers): Oppression operates through social structures, not
  just individual acts; traditions perpetuate these structures

@incollection{okin1999multiculturalism,
  author = {Okin, Susan Moller},
  title = {Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?},
  booktitle = {Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?},
  year = {1999},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  doi = {10.1515/9781400840991-002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Okin argues that many cultural practices protected under multicultural policies are patriarchal and harmful to women within minority communities. Group rights for cultural minorities can conflict with gender equality when those cultures have internal practices that subordinate women. Liberal multiculturalism often implicitly assumes the male perspective as representing the group, thereby obscuring women's distinct interests.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for feminist critique of harmful traditions in contemporary philosophy. Essential for the project's question of WHEN traditions lack value: when they systematically subordinate members (particularly women) and restrict autonomy. Okin's framework directly addresses the conditions under which cultural traditions should be reformed or rejected rather than preserved. Her work sparked extensive debate on balancing cultural respect with universal human rights.

  POSITION: Represents liberal feminist universalism critiquing cultural relativism; argues that gender justice has priority over cultural preservation when traditions are oppressive.

@book{young1990justice,
  author = {Young, Iris Marion},
  title = {Justice and the Politics of Difference},
  year = {1990},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Young develops a framework of "five faces of oppression" (exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, violence) to analyze structural injustice beyond distributive paradigms. She argues that oppression operates through social structures and cultural meanings, not merely through individual acts or resource distribution. Traditional approaches to justice fail to address these structural forms of domination embedded in social practices and institutions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most influential analytical framework for understanding how traditions function as systems of domination. The "five faces" model allows precise diagnosis of different mechanisms through which traditions perpetuate injustice. Crucial for the project's inquiry into harmful traditions: traditions become problematic when they instantiate any of these faces of oppression, particularly through cultural imperialism (imposing dominant group's norms as universal) and systematic violence.

  POSITION: Critical theory approach to social justice; emphasizes group-based structural oppression over individual rights violations.

  journal = {Ethnicities},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1177/14687968251362252},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Godman challenges Okin's critique by arguing that while multiculturalist policies can harm women, alternative frameworks (cosmopolitanism, liberal nationalism) also have problematic implications for women. Crucially, much gender emancipation by minority women is identified and advocated through their cultural membership, not against it. Cultural diversity has epistemic value for feminist problem-solving by expanding the imagination about gender possibilities.

  RELEVANCE: Provides essential counter-perspective to simple rejection of harmful traditions, showing that tradition-internal reform and cultural membership can be resources for women's emancipation, not only constraints. Important for the project's nuanced approach to when traditions are valuable: cultural frameworks provide conceptual resources even while requiring feminist transformation. Demonstrates complexity of abandonment vs. reform question.

  POSITION: Pluralist feminism; critiques both uncritical multiculturalism and feminist universalism; argues for culturally-grounded emancipation.

  year = {2006},
  publisher = {Duke University Press},
  doi = {10.1515/9780822386988},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Alexander develops transnational feminist theory that critiques both Northern feminism's universalism and the heteronormative regulation of modern state formations, including in postcolonial contexts. She examines how colonial Christianity and neocolonial modernity invented new oppressive "traditions" while criminalizing queer communities in both the US and Caribbean. Transgenerational memory and spiritual practice function as resistance to multiple forms of colonial and patriarchal domination.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how traditions of oppression are actively constructed by colonial and neocolonial powers, not simply "ancient customs." Demonstrates that critique of harmful traditions must account for how domination creates and invents traditions that serve power. Particularly important for the project's postcolonial dimension: shows how both "Western" and "indigenous" traditions can be heteronormative regulatory mechanisms.

  POSITION: Transnational feminism with postcolonial and queer theory; critiques both Western imperialism and patriarchal nationalisms.

@article{george2024tradition,
  author = {George, Noel Mariam},
  title = {Are Tradition and Modernity Antagonistic? Ambedkar in and Against the Postcolonial Project},
  journal = {Postcolonial Studies},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {27},
  pages = {248--266},
  doi = {10.1080/13688790.2024.2304472},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: George challenges Ashis Nandy's postcolonial rejection of modernity by examining B.R. Ambedkar's approach to tradition and emancipation. While Nandy sees modernity as colonial domination, Ambedkar synthesized modernity's emancipatory potential (individual liberation) without dismissing communal collective identity. Postcolonial scholarship's conflation of modernity with coloniality creates a problematic choice between oppressive Western modernity and oppressive indigenous traditions, missing possibilities for critical appropriation of both.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for the project's question of abandoning vs. reforming traditions. Shows that wholesale rejection of either tradition or modernity forecloses emancipatory possibilities. Particularly important for understanding conditions of tradition's value: traditions have value when they can incorporate modernity's emancipatory elements while maintaining cultural continuity, not when they are preserved unchanged or entirely rejected. Ambedkar's caste critique demonstrates tradition-internal grounds for abandoning harmful traditions.

  POSITION: Critical postcolonial theory; argues for selective appropriation of both tradition and modernity against cultural essentialism.

  journal = {Constellations},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.12790},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Radhakrishnan challenges Frankfurt School immanent critique methodology from decolonial perspectives (Quijano, Dussel, Lugones, Oyěwùmí). Immanent critique—judging practices by their internal norms—risks: (1) inattentiveness to constitutive exclusions of who counts in the community; (2) placing asymmetrical burdens on marginalized critics to work within frameworks that marginalize them; (3) replicating colonial mechanisms of domination through the practice of critique itself. Critique must attend to power relations governing critique, not just criticized practices.

  RELEVANCE: Provides meta-critical perspective essential for the project: how do we critique harmful traditions without reproducing colonial dynamics? Addresses the methodological problem of when tradition-external critique is legitimate. Shows that even progressive critical methods (Frankfurt School) can perpetuate domination if they assume universal validity of particular cultural frameworks. Essential for navigating universalism vs. relativism debate in the project.

  POSITION: Decolonial epistemology; argues for pluralistic rather than immanent-only methods of critique; centers coloniality of power.

  number = {1},
  pages = {133--156},
  doi = {10.1080/02589346.2013.765680},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ratele critiques how both traditionalist defenses of hetero-patriarchy and progressive critiques of "traditional masculinity" essentialize and homogenize African tradition. The moment critics invoke "tradition" to reject queer sexualities, they reify a static, tribalized notion of culture. Yet anti-traditionalist critiques also risk cultural imperialism. African traditions have always been dynamic and contested, not monolithic sources of hetero-masculine authority. Recognition of queer desires requires deconstructing false traditionalism without abandoning cultural particularity.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how "tradition" functions as rhetorical weapon to enforce contemporary oppression while claiming ancient authority. Essential for the project's question of distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions: harmful traditions are often recently invented or selectively interpreted to serve current power interests, not genuinely ancient practices. Shows that tradition-critique must be historically informed about what traditions actually were vs. what current authorities claim they were.

  POSITION: Postcolonial queer theory; critiques both traditionalist hetero-patriarchy and Western universalist anti-traditionalism.

@article{rollo2020silence,

  journal = {Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {24},
  number = {3},
  pages = {316--329},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2020.1796330},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rollo identifies how liberal social contract tradition contains "domination contracts" excluding those deemed incapable of speech and reason (particularly children and people with intellectual disabilities). There are two forms: (1) contingent domination contracts (potentially disputed by proving speech/reason capacity—how women and racialized peoples gained inclusion); (2) structural domination contracts (cannot be resolved for those deemed permanently "silent"). The liberal veneration of voice is itself an exclusionary tradition requiring reconceptualization of democratic inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Exposes how core liberal-democratic traditions embed exclusionary domination while claiming universality. Crucial for the project's question of harmful traditions: some of philosophy's most "progressive" traditions (social contract theory, democratic voice) contain exclusionary mechanisms. Challenges simple progressive/traditional binary. Shows conditions for abandoning traditions: when their central concepts (voice as prerequisite for inclusion) structurally exclude legitimate participants.

  POSITION: Radical democratic theory; critiques liberal tradition from disability and childhood studies perspectives.

@article{lepinard2011autonomy,

  volume = {18},
  number = {2},
  pages = {205--221},
  doi = {10.1111/J.1467-8675.2011.00634.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lépinard examines the tension in Okin's work between universal feminist norms and women's cultural agency. Okin's critique of harmful cultural practices risks denying agency to women who participate in those practices. The feminist subject capable of autonomous choice is itself a culturally-specific construction. This creates a dilemma: either respect women's choices within cultural contexts (risking endorsement of oppressive practices) or impose external feminist norms (denying agency and reproducing colonial dynamics).

  RELEVANCE: Central to the project's question of when to abandon traditions. Shows that conditions for tradition-abandonment cannot be determined purely externally—must account for insider perspectives and agency. Important corrective to overly-simple feminist universalism: respecting autonomy may mean respecting culturally-embedded choices, even ones that seem to perpetuate subordination. Suggests tradition-value depends partly on whether insiders experience traditions as constraining or enabling.

  POSITION: Poststructuralist feminism; critiques both liberal feminist universalism and uncritical cultural relativism.

@article{vedder2023gendered,
  author = {Vedder, Ophelia},
  title = {Eliminating the Gendered Division of Labor: The Argument from Primary Goods},
  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {24},
  number = {2},
  pages = {335--356},
  doi = {10.1177/14748851231200147},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vedder argues that Rawls's political liberalism (not just his earlier justice as fairness) provides resources for feminist critique of gendered division of labor. The gendered division of labor distributes primary goods (resources all citizens need as citizens) unfairly to women. She advocates for "Gender Egalitarian Daddy Quota" parental leave policy on grounds that fair distribution of primary goods requires eliminating gendered care traditions. This shows political liberalism can ground feminist transformation without relying on comprehensive doctrines.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how liberal political tradition's own principles can ground critique and transformation of gendered traditions, answering Okin's worry about political liberalism's feminist potential. Relevant to project's question of tradition-reform vs. abandonment: deeply entrenched gendered care traditions can be transformed through policy that realigns incentives and opportunities. Shows conditions under which traditions should be abandoned: when they violate fair distribution of social primary goods necessary for citizenship.

  POSITION: Political liberal feminism; uses Rawlsian framework for gender justice without relying on comprehensive feminism.

  volume = {26},
  number = {2},
  pages = {105--144},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2016.0009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Earp argues that Western debates on female genital cutting/mutilation (FGM) often fall into either problematic relativism (all cultural practices are equal) or hypocrisy (condemning African practices while accepting comparable Western practices like cosmetic genital surgery and routine male circumcision). He develops a framework for evaluating genital cutting practices that avoids both relativism and double standards, focusing on consent, harm, and medical necessity rather than cultural origin.

  RELEVANCE: Exemplifies the methodological challenge central to the project: how to critique harmful traditional practices without cultural imperialism. Demonstrates that critique of harmful traditions requires consistent principles applied across cultures, not selective condemnation of "other" cultures' practices. Essential for the project's conditions of tradition-abandonment: practices should be evaluated by universal ethical standards (harm, consent, autonomy) while acknowledging that application requires cultural sensitivity and consistency.

  POSITION: Bioethical universalism with attention to cultural context; critiques both relativism and ethnocentrism.

  volume = {8},
  pages = {1--17},
  doi = {10.1007/s41055-022-00116-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Letourneau and Pigeon argue against ethical relativism regarding culinary traditions, developing an "acceptability test" for food practices involving animal cruelty or environmental harm. They contend that moral progress is possible and that some traditional practices (using dog meat industry in South Korea as case study) can be objectively judged problematic despite cultural embeddedness. Cultural practices involving cruelty or environmental damage fail ethical justification regardless of their traditional status.

  RELEVANCE: Applies tradition-critique to concrete case (food practices), showing how philosophical principles translate to specific traditions. Relevant to project's question of when traditions lack value: when they cause unnecessary suffering or environmental damage not justified by cultural meaning. Demonstrates that tradition-as-justification has limits—traditional status does not immunize practices from ethical evaluation. Provides model for balancing cultural respect with ethical standards.

  POSITION: Objectivist ethics regarding harm; argues against cultural relativism about cruelty and environmental damage.

  number = {4},
  pages = {272--285},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2018.1444111},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vaditya argues that social domination produces epistemic marginalization—the systematic exclusion of subordinated groups' knowledge and perspectives from dominant epistemic frameworks. Traditional epistemology reinforces this marginalization by treating dominant groups' knowledge as objective and universal. He advocates for a "methodology of the oppressed" that centers marginalized epistemic standpoints as resources for more adequate understanding of social reality.

  RELEVANCE: Extends domination-critique to epistemology itself, showing how traditions of knowledge production perpetuate subordination. Essential for the project's meta-level question: what epistemic practices should guide evaluation of traditions? Suggests that determining when traditions are harmful requires centering perspectives of those subordinated within those traditions, not only external or dominant perspectives. Epistemic traditions themselves can be oppressive and require transformation.

  POSITION: Standpoint epistemology and social epistemology; argues for centering marginalized knowledge in critique of domination.

  year = {2024},
  pages = {1598--1610},
  doi = {10.1145/3630106.3658934},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Naudts transposes Iris Marion Young's "five faces of oppression" framework to digital contexts, arguing that data-driven decision-making systems introduce new forms of oppression and domination. Algorithmic systems marginalize users, render them powerless, and perpetuate existing social structures of subordination through automated processes. Digital justice requires understanding how socio-technical systems co-shape social structures and relationships, not just individual rights violations.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how oppression frameworks apply to emerging technological practices, showing that traditions of domination adapt to new forms. Important for the project's contemporary relevance: while traditional forms of cultural domination continue, new technological "traditions" (algorithmic governance, surveillance capitalism) create novel pathologies. Shows that critique of harmful traditions must be dynamic, addressing emergent as well as ancient forms of subordination.

  POSITION: Applies critical theory (Young) to technology ethics; argues for structural rather than individualist analysis of digital injustice.

  number = {2},
  pages = {253--276},
  doi = {10.1080/02680930903460740},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gillborn uses critical race theory to expose how statistical methods and quantitative research traditions encode racist assumptions about educational inequality. Statisticians' choices about what counts as "real" inequality and how to "explain" racial disparities often reflect majoritarian assumptions that obscure material reality of racism. The more statisticians manipulate data, the more likely majoritarian assumptions become embedded in calculations themselves. Traditional quantitative methods perpetuate rather than reveal racial domination.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how academic and methodological traditions themselves can be oppressive, not only cultural practices. Essential for the project's methodological self-awareness: traditions of inquiry (quantitative methods, deficit-thinking frameworks) can perpetuate the very domination they purport to study. Shows that critique of harmful traditions must extend to scholarly traditions, not only folk practices. Relevant to conditions for abandoning traditions: when methodological traditions systematically obscure injustice.

  POSITION: Critical race theory applied to research methods; argues against value-neutrality of quantitative traditions.

  number = {3},
  pages = {220--233},
  doi = {10.1177/09667350211000614},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Brazal critiques how Catholic social teaching in Laudato Si' reinforces patriarchal associations of women with nature, fragility, and care despite its progressive ecological message. The encyclical's "family of creation" metaphor with nature as nurturing mother/vulnerable sister perpetuates traditional gender roles. While advocating care ethics, it inadvertently undermines women's agency and maintains hierarchical headship by "all-powerful Father," thus reifying women-nature-care connection and logic of male domination.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how even progressive religious traditions attempting reform can perpetuate oppressive gender norms through metaphors and theological language. Important for project's question of tradition-reform vs. abandonment: shows difficulty of reforming deeply-encoded patriarchal traditions even when explicit intention is liberatory. Relevant to conditions under which traditions resist reform: when core metaphors and theological structures continue gender subordination despite surface-level progressive claims.

  number = {3},
  pages = {333--351},
  doi = {10.1111/phil.12378},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Faruque argues that contemporary Muslim intellectual crisis stems from "epistemic colonialism"—mental subjugation to Eurocentric knowledge systems since the Renaissance. Decolonization requires deconstructing Western episteme and retrieving Islamic intellectual heritage for thinking with indigenous categories. However, postcolonial severance from tradition means many Muslim intellectuals lack linguistic and conceptual connection to their heritage. Without grounding self-identity in Islamic tradition, Muslims remain captive to epistemic colonialism despite maintaining religious practice.

  RELEVANCE: Provides non-Western perspective on tradition-loss as form of oppression, contrasting with Western feminist/liberal emphasis on tradition-as-oppression. Shows that abandoning traditions can itself be effect of colonial domination, not only liberation. Important for project's nuanced approach: tradition-loss and tradition-maintenance can both be pathological depending on context. Relevant to conditions of tradition-value: traditions have value as resources for epistemic decolonization and autonomous self-identity formation.

  pages = {390--406},
  doi = {10.1080/10510974.2024.2345517},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Chirindo and Mutua develop African critical theory grounded in Bantu cosmology as alternative to Frankfurt School and Chicago School critical traditions. They argue that Western critical theory's narrow focus on power and domination affecting individuals reflects liberal assumptions. Bantu worldview prioritizes relatedness and community wellbeing, offering broader basis for critique than Western emphasis on individual liberation from domination. African orientation shows that traditions can provide resources for critical intervention, not only objects of critique.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges project's potentially Western-centric framing of traditions as primarily sources of oppression vs. value. Shows that traditions provide conceptual resources for critique itself, not only objects requiring critique. Important for methodological pluralism: conditions for abandoning vs. maintaining traditions depend partly on which critical frameworks are employed. Suggests traditions have value as bases for culturally-grounded critical work, not only as potential impediments to justice.

  number = {6},
  pages = {2439--2444},
  doi = {10.1007/s00146-023-01698-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sparrow argues that even "friendly" superintelligent AI would render humans unfree through domination in the neo-republican sense (Pettit). Benevolence is insufficient for freedom, which requires equality and non-interference. As long as AI has power to interfere in humanity's choices without reference to our interests, it dominates us. The comparison to well-treated pets is apt: kind treatment doesn't eliminate subordinate status. If superintelligence emergence is plausible, AI research itself should be reconsidered, not merely safety protocols.

  RELEVANCE: Extends domination-critique to emerging technological traditions and research programs, showing that harmful traditions can be prospective, not only inherited from past. Relevant to project's question of abandoning traditions: even new technological "traditions" (AI research paradigms) may need abandonment if they lead to domination, not merely reform. Important for showing that tradition-critique must be forward-looking—some practices should not become traditional because their trajectory leads to subordination.

  POSITION: Neo-republican political philosophy applied to AI ethics; argues for abandoning AI research trajectory on domination grounds.
