## Section 1: Theoretical Foundations of Tradition's Value

Before examining specific philosophical defenses of tradition's value, we must establish the meta-level frameworks for understanding *how* traditions generate normative force. The literature reveals three distinct approaches: value-theoretic analyses distinguishing what types of value traditions possess, accounts emphasizing temporality and authority, and MacIntyre's radical thesis that traditions constitute rationality itself. These frameworks provide essential conceptual tools for evaluating competing positions.

### Meta-Ethical Frameworks: Intrinsic, Instrumental, and Constitutive Value

Standard value theory distinguishes intrinsic value (valuable in itself), instrumental value (valuable as means to ends), and final value (valuable as end) (Schroeder 2021). Yet tradition resists these categories. Conservative arguments frequently slide between claiming tradition has intrinsic value—that mere antiquity or continuity matters independently of content—and epistemic instrumental value, where traditions are valuable as reliable guides to truth or practical wisdom (Hamilton 2015). This equivocation generates confusion. Is tradition valuable *because it is tradition*, or because traditions tend to preserve wisdom?

Scheffler (2010) develops the most influential liberal response through his "conditional value" thesis: traditions have genuine but defeasible normative force through their identity-constituting role. Traditions shape personal and collective identity in ways that give them non-instrumental significance—they are not mere means to independent ends but partly constitute what makes lives meaningful. Yet this value remains conditional: traditions matter because of their role in human flourishing, not as independent sources of authority. When traditions conflict with more fundamental moral considerations, their value can be outweighed. This position attempts to navigate between dismissing tradition entirely and granting it absolute authority.

Kumar (2019) argues that Scheffler's framework underestimates tradition's constitutive role by treating it as merely conditionally valuable. Kumar proposes that traditions possess "framework value"—they structure the evaluative space within which other goods are pursued without themselves being ends-in-themselves. This moves beyond the simple intrinsic/instrumental dichotomy by showing how traditions can be normatively significant as background conditions for meaningful choice and evaluation. The concept parallels Rawls's account of primary goods as all-purpose means, but applies to cultural-evaluative frameworks rather than material resources.

Wall (2016) offers a more systematic tripartite analysis distinguishing among epistemic authority (traditions as reliable guides to truth), practical authority (traditions as sources of obligations), and expressive authority (traditions as vehicles for identity). This taxonomy helps disambiguate tradition's value-types, showing that traditions may simultaneously possess multiple forms of authority grounded in different considerations. Epistemic authority depends on reliability of tradition's causal history; practical authority requires that traditions generate genuine reasons for action; expressive authority emerges from traditions' role in constituting valuable identities. Wall's framework reveals that debates about tradition's value often involve competing assessments of which authority-type predominates.

Casal (2020) extends the conditional value approach through case studies of controversial practices like whaling and bullfighting. She argues that traditions contribute to social cohesion and cultural meaning, providing prima facie reasons to maintain them. However, these contributions cannot override weightier moral considerations, especially harm to sentient beings. Tradition provides reasons for action but not decisive or exclusionary reasons. Casal's analysis shows how conditional value works in practice: tradition's weight varies with both its contributions to identity and its costs measured against independent moral standards.

The value-theoretic literature thus reveals fundamental disagreement about whether tradition possesses intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive, or framework value. This disagreement is not merely terminological but reflects deeper conflicts about tradition's normative foundations. The question "what kind of value do traditions have?" remains contested because different philosophical frameworks employ incompatible evaluative structures.

### Authority, Temporality, and Living Traditions

Authority claims are central to tradition's normative force, yet what grounds such authority? Historical pedigree alone cannot justify normative claims without vicious circularity—the past cannot bind the present merely by being past. Christiano (2021) distinguishes de facto authority (actual power to command) from legitimate authority (moral right to command), noting that legitimate authority requires justification through consent, fair procedures, or service to recognizable goods. Traditional authority, considered as one possible basis for legitimacy, must meet these standards rather than claiming self-justification through antiquity.

Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition and authority in hermeneutic philosophy offers an alternative approach. Dostal (2016) explicates how Gadamer challenges the Enlightenment's "prejudice against prejudice," arguing that all understanding requires pre-judgments inherited from tradition. These prejudices are not obstacles to knowledge but its condition—we cannot understand without interpretive frameworks received from our cultural-historical situation. Authority can be rational when grounded in genuine expertise: we rationally submit to epistemic authority when experts know more than we do. Similarly, tradition's authority need not involve blind submission but can be rational acknowledgment of its epistemic resources. This view reframes tradition from dogmatic constraint to enabling condition for understanding.

Allan (1986) develops a complementary phenomenological account of how the past acquires normative significance. He distinguishes types of importance: inherited (given through tradition), imagined (projected through ideal), and created (achieved through action). Tradition's authority emerges from the recursive relationship between inherited meanings and present interpretation—neither purely given nor purely constructed but dialogically achieved. The past imposes constraints (we cannot choose our inheritance) yet remains open to reinterpretation (we choose what to emphasize and develop). This dynamic conception avoids both conservative reification of tradition as fixed and liberal voluntarism that treats tradition as optional.

Beckstein's (2017) concept of "living tradition" provides crucial criteria for distinguishing valuable traditions from ossified or defunct ones. Living traditions are characterized by: (1) continuity over time, (2) active practice and transmission, (3) internal contestation and development, (4) critical reflection by participants, and (5) capacity for adaptation. This account bridges conservative and liberal perspectives by showing that genuine traditions combine stability with change. Dead traditions are mere historical artifacts lacking present practitioners; dying traditions are ossifying through loss of internal vitality; only living traditions generate special normative force through their ongoing character as arguments embodying practical rationality.

Beckstein's framework addresses a fundamental problem: if all traditions possessed equal authority by virtue of being traditions, we would have no basis for distinguishing valuable from harmful ones. The "living tradition" concept provides normative criteria: traditions merit respect when they remain living arguments capable of self-criticism and development, not when they become fossilized dogmas. This distinction is essential for any account claiming traditions matter normatively—it shows *which* traditions matter and why.

Yet operationalizing "living" versus "dead" traditions proves difficult. How much internal contestation is required? What degree of adaptation is permissible before tradition loses identity? Beckstein provides conceptual framework but limited guidance for applying it to particular cases. The criteria remain underspecified, creating ambiguity in evaluating specific traditions. This gap between conceptual clarity and practical application recurs throughout the literature.

### MacIntyre's Tradition-Constituted Rationality

MacIntyre's work represents the most philosophically ambitious account of tradition's constitutive value. Across *After Virtue* (1981), *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988), and *Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry* (1990), MacIntyre develops the thesis that all rationality is tradition-constituted. Different philosophical traditions—Aristotelian, Augustinian, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal—embody incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical reason. No tradition-independent standpoint exists from which to adjudicate between them. Rationality itself depends on the narrative and conceptual resources of particular traditions.

This is *not* relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions are "living arguments" capable of rational progress through dialectical engagement. Traditions develop by resolving internal epistemic crises—situations where their inherited resources prove inadequate to address new problems. A tradition demonstrates rationality by explaining its own history of development, understanding rival traditions better than those rivals understand themselves, and showing how its framework can resolve problems that defeated rivals. Rational superiority emerges from superior explanatory and problem-solving capacity, not correspondence to tradition-neutral standards.

D'Andrea (2006) clarifies that MacIntyre's position differs fundamentally from both conservative reverence for tradition-as-such and postmodern relativism. Conservative traditionalism treats tradition as authority demanding deference; MacIntyre treats traditions as ongoing inquiries requiring critical participation. Postmodern relativism denies rational progress across paradigms; MacIntyre shows how traditions can be evaluated through their capacity to resolve crises and comprehend rivals. Traditions are bearers of methodological as well as substantive commitments, enabling truth-seeking rather than merely preserving inherited beliefs.

MacIntyre's account operates at three levels showing tradition's pervasive constitutive role. At the individual level, virtues are excellences developed through participation in practices—coherent social activities with internal goods (standards of excellence) and external goods (social rewards). At the communal level, practices are embedded in traditions that provide the narrative and conceptual frameworks within which practices make sense. At the epistemic level, traditions constitute the standards of rational justification themselves. This three-level architecture shows how tradition shapes moral life from individual character through shared practices to the very structure of rationality.

The claim that traditions possess neither intrinsic value (independent of rational content) nor merely instrumental value (means to independent ends), but *constitutive* value as conditions for rational inquiry itself, represents MacIntyre's distinctive contribution. Traditions are not valuable because they are old, nor because they reliably produce good outcomes, but because they constitute the frameworks within which "old," "good," and "valuable" acquire determinate meaning. This meta-level argument, if successful, transforms the debate: the question becomes not whether to value tradition but which tradition provides the most adequate framework for inquiry.

Yet MacIntyre's framework faces significant challenges. If rationality is tradition-constituted, how do we evaluate traditions' rationality without vicious circularity? MacIntyre appeals to traditions' capacity for self-criticism and understanding rivals, but critics question whether this escapes the circle. If each tradition defines what counts as "understanding" and "rational progress," how can we adjudicate genuine disagreement? The framework risks collapsing into sophisticated relativism despite MacIntyre's protests. Moreover, by emphasizing rational inquiry, MacIntyre may understate traditions that constitute identity through emotional, ritual, or aesthetic resources beyond discursive argument. Not all valuable traditions are "living arguments" in MacIntyre's intellectualist sense.

Beadle and Moore (2011) extend MacIntyre's framework to organizational contexts, showing how institutions embody practices with internal goods while pursuing external goods. This application demonstrates tradition's constitutive role at institutional levels, but also reveals tensions: when institutional pressures conflict with practice-embedded traditions, practitioners experience moral distress. The MacIntyrean account explains why such conflicts are fundamental—they represent incompatible rationalities, not merely competing interests. Yet the framework provides limited guidance for resolving them beyond appealing to the superiority of practice-based rationality.

---

The theoretical foundations reveal three distinct frameworks for understanding tradition's value. Value-theoretic analyses distinguish types of value traditions may possess—intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive, or framework value—but fail to reach consensus on which applies. Accounts emphasizing temporality and authority show how tradition's normative force emerges through historical continuity and living development, but struggle to operationalize criteria for distinguishing valuable from harmful traditions. MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality provides the strongest philosophical articulation of tradition's constitutive value, yet faces challenges regarding circularity and intellectualism.

These frameworks are not mutually exclusive but highlight different aspects of tradition's normative significance. The question "what kind of value do traditions have?" resists simple answers because traditions simultaneously function as epistemic resources, identity-constituting frameworks, and conditions for rationality. Subsequent sections examine how specific philosophical traditions—conservative, communitarian, liberal—employ these foundational concepts to defend or critique tradition's value.
