## Introduction

Traditions are ubiquitous in political and cultural life—constitutional frameworks, democratic practices, religious observances, professional standards, cultural identities. Yet their normative status remains deeply contested. When should we defer to inherited wisdom versus subject traditions to critical scrutiny? This question is fundamentally normative, concerning not what traditions *are* conceptually but when and why they are *valuable*—or not. Contemporary philosophy reveals three major positions structuring debate: conservative epistemic arguments claiming tradition embodies accumulated practical wisdom (Robson 2025; Levy 2017); communitarian constitutive arguments that traditions constitute rationality and identity (MacIntyre 1988; Taylor 1989); and liberal-critical positions asserting tradition's value is conditional, constrained by autonomy, justice, and equality (Scheffler 2010; Okin 1999).

The central tension emerges sharply: traditions simultaneously enable meaningful political life while potentially perpetuating domination. MacIntyre's *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?* (1988) articulates the strongest philosophical case that all rationality is tradition-constituted—different traditions embody incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical reason, making tradition not optional but necessary for intelligible moral inquiry. Yet Okin's feminist critique asks pointedly "Is multiculturalism bad for women?" (1999), demonstrating how cultural traditions systematically subordinate women while claiming authenticity. How do we distinguish valuable from oppressive traditions when both fulfill constitutive roles in identity and community?

Recent work complicates simple dichotomies. Beckstein's concept of "living traditions" (2017) distinguishes traditions exhibiting continuity, active practice, internal contestation, and critical reflection from ossified or defunct ones—only living traditions generate special normative force. Scheffler's "conditional value" thesis (2010) argues traditions have genuine but defeasible normative significance through their identity-constituting role, requiring neither uncritical preservation nor wholesale rejection. Yet conditions for distinguishing living from dead traditions, or valuable from harmful ones, remain systematically underspecified.

This review examines how philosophy analyzes and explains tradition's value across four major domains. Section 1 establishes theoretical foundations—the meta-ethical frameworks (intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive value), authority structures, and MacIntyre's tradition-constituted rationality that provide conceptual architecture. Section 2 examines three major defenses: conservative epistemic arguments about tradition's accumulated wisdom, communitarian virtue ethics emphasizing constitutive role in identity and practical wisdom, and liberal multiculturalism's attempted reconciliation with autonomy. Section 3 analyzes critical objections—feminist and liberal autonomy-based critiques, structural domination analyses, and normative criteria for abandoning traditions. Section 4 synthesizes findings, identifying research gaps and proposing an integrative framework balancing epistemic, constitutive, and justice dimensions.

The review strategy emphasizes normative arguments and conditions of value rather than comprehensive coverage. It focuses on major philosophical debates and critical tensions, particularly the productive but unresolved conflict between universal moral standards (needed to critique harmful traditions) and cultural particularity (needed to avoid imperialism). This tension may be inherent in the question of tradition's value rather than a solvable problem.
