## Section 3: Critical Tensions and Objections

If conservative and communitarian defenses of tradition establish *when* traditions may be valuable, feminist, liberal, and postcolonial critiques establish equally clearly *when* they are not. These critical perspectives converge on a fundamental challenge: traditions can function as mechanisms of domination, systematically subordinating vulnerable members while claiming cultural authenticity. The debate reveals an unresolved tension between universal moral standards (required to critique harmful traditions) and respect for cultural particularity (required to avoid imperialism). Neither pure universalism nor relativism succeeds, yet the question of tradition's value cannot avoid this tension.

### The Tradition-Autonomy Tension: Feminist and Liberal Critiques

Susan Okin's "Is multiculturalism bad for women?" articulates the core liberal feminist objection to traditional practices. Most cultures, Okin observes, are patriarchal, and multicultural policies protecting group rights often "come at the expense of women within those groups" (Okin 1999, 25). Forced marriage, polygamy, unequal inheritance, and restricted mobility—practices defended as cultural tradition—systematically subordinate women while the liberal multiculturalist discourse implicitly takes the male perspective as representing "the group," thereby obscuring women's distinct interests. When traditions violate women's autonomy and perpetuate gender inequality, liberal principles should override cultural preservation claims. This establishes a clear boundary condition: traditions lack value when they systematically restrict members' capacity for self-determination, particularly along gender lines.

Yet Okin's framework faces internal difficulties. Lépinard (2011) identifies a dilemma: the autonomous feminist subject capable of rejecting oppressive traditions is itself a culturally-specific liberal construction. Either feminists respect women's choices within cultural contexts—risking endorsement of subordination—or impose external feminist norms, thereby denying agency and reproducing colonial dynamics. The very concept of autonomy presupposed by liberal critique may not adequately capture how women exercise agency within traditional frameworks. Narayan and Harding (2000) extend this postcolonial feminist challenge, arguing that liberal feminist critiques of "Third World" traditions can serve orientalist agendas, essentializing non-Western women as passive victims. Women within traditional communities resist and renegotiate practices through culturally-grounded means, not merely through liberal autonomy.

Godman (2025) offers a recent rebuttal to Okin, arguing that multiculturalism is actually good for women in three ways: alternative frameworks (cosmopolitanism, liberal nationalism) also harm women; much feminist advocacy by minority women occurs *through* their cultural membership, not against it; and cultural diversity has epistemic value for feminist problem-solving. This challenges the simple opposition between tradition and women's interests, suggesting that cultural contexts can provide resources for gender emancipation, not only constraints.

The liberal education debates sharpen this autonomy tension. Franklin-Hall (2021) defends education for rational autonomy against charges that it privileges Enlightenment values over faith. He argues that critical rational reflection is not sectarian but a universal feature of reasoning—teaching children to reason well respects them as reasoning beings. Marples (2005) goes further, contending that faith schools violate children's rights to an "open future" and autonomous development by prioritizing religious tradition over children's developing capacity for independent moral reasoning. Yet Schouten (2018) identifies a problem: political liberalism cannot justify full autonomy education solely on citizenship grounds without perfectionist claims about autonomy's intrinsic value. Such perfectionism conflicts with neutrality among comprehensive doctrines, including religious traditions. If liberalism must embrace perfectionism to critique tradition-based education, it abandons neutrality and imposes contested values.

The tradition-autonomy tension appears intractable. Pure autonomy-maximization ignores how agency operates within cultural contexts and risks cultural imperialism. But accommodation of traditions that constrain autonomy seems to contradict liberal commitments to individual freedom. Neither pole resolves the tension—revealing deep value conflicts rather than philosophical confusion.

### Structural Domination and Oppressive Traditions

Where liberal critiques focus on autonomy, critical theory analyzes how traditions function as systems of structural domination. Iris Marion Young's *Justice and the Politics of Difference* (1990) provides the most influential framework through her "five faces of oppression": exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, and systematic violence. Crucially, oppression operates through social structures and cultural meanings embedded in institutions, not merely through individual acts or resource distribution. Traditions become oppressive by institutionalizing these faces of oppression within "normal" social practices that appear natural to dominant groups.

This framework reveals tradition-as-oppression often remains invisible precisely because it is embedded in taken-for-granted cultural meanings. The gendered division of labor, for instance, exploits women's unpaid care work, marginalizes them from public sphere participation, renders them powerless in household decision-making, imposes dominant gender norms as universal (cultural imperialism), and exposes them to domestic violence legitimized by patriarchal authority. Vedder (2023) demonstrates how even Rawls's political liberalism provides resources for critiquing such traditions: gendered care traditions violate fair distribution of primary goods necessary for citizenship. Liberal political tradition's own principles ground transformation of oppressive gendered traditions without requiring comprehensive feminist doctrines.

Alexander's (2006) transnational feminist work exposes a further dimension: colonial powers actively *constructed* new oppressive "traditions" while claiming to preserve authentic culture. Heteronormative regulation of sexuality, often presented as "traditional," frequently represents recent colonial imposition rather than indigenous practice. This challenges simplistic tradition-modernity binaries—critique must recognize how domination *creates* traditions serving power, not merely how it perpetuates ancient customs. Ratele (2013) extends this analysis to African masculinities, showing how invocations of "tradition" to enforce hetero-patriarchy and reject queer sexualities reify static, tribalized notions of culture. African traditions were always dynamic and contested, not monolithic sources of hetero-masculine authority. "Tradition" functions as rhetorical weapon enforcing contemporary oppression while claiming ancient legitimacy.

Ambedkar's approach to caste, as analyzed by George (2024), demonstrates tradition-internal grounds for rejecting oppressive practices. Rather than choosing between tradition and modernity—the false choice that postcolonial scholarship often presents—Ambedkar synthesized modernity's emancipatory potential (individual liberation) with cultural continuity. Wholesale rejection of either tradition or modernity forecloses emancipation. This suggests that traditions possess value when they can incorporate emancipatory elements while maintaining identity, not when preserved unchanged or entirely rejected.

Radhakrishnan's (2025) meta-critique adds methodological complexity: even progressive critical methods like Frankfurt School immanent critique can perpetuate colonial domination by assuming universal validity of particular frameworks. Immanent critique—judging traditions by internal norms—risks inattentiveness to constitutive exclusions of who counts in the community, places asymmetrical burdens on marginalized critics to work within frameworks that marginalize them, and replicates colonial mechanisms through the practice of critique itself. Critique must attend to power relations governing critique, not only criticized practices. This challenges any simple external critique of traditions while acknowledging that tradition-internal critique may reproduce exclusions.

Even liberalism's "progressive" traditions embed structural domination. Rollo (2020) identifies "domination contracts" within social contract theory that exclude those deemed incapable of speech and reason—particularly children and people with intellectual disabilities. The liberal veneration of voice is itself an exclusionary tradition requiring reconceptualization. This exposes how philosophy's canonical traditions contain mechanisms of subordination while claiming universality, complicating any straightforward progressive-traditional binary.

### When Should Traditions Be Abandoned? Normative Criteria

If traditions can be oppressive, under what conditions should they be reformed versus abandoned entirely? Several normative frameworks converge on criteria for tradition-abandonment, though they differ in justificatory basis.

Casal's (2020) "conditional value" thesis, applied to controversial practices like whaling and bullfighting, holds that traditions possess value through contributions to social cohesion and cultural meaning, but these cannot override weightier moral considerations. Tradition provides *prima facie* reasons, not decisive ones. When practices cause unjustified harm to sentient beings or perpetuate injustice, traditional status does not immunize them from moral criticism.

Earp (2016) develops a consistency principle for evaluating traditional practices across cultures. Western debates on female genital cutting/mutilation fall into either relativism (all cultural practices equal) or hypocrisy (condemning African practices while accepting comparable Western procedures like cosmetic genital surgery and routine male circumcision). Consistent ethical principles—harm, consent, autonomy—must apply cross-culturally. Practices should be evaluated by universal standards while acknowledging that application requires cultural sensitivity and without selective condemnation of "other" cultures.

Letourneau and Pigeon (2023) apply an "acceptability test" to culinary traditions: practices involving unnecessary suffering or environmental damage fail ethical justification regardless of traditional status. Cultural practices causing cruelty or ecological harm—they examine dog meat industry in South Korea—cannot be defended by appeals to cultural embeddedness. This demonstrates that tradition-as-justification has limits; traditional pedigree does not exempt practices from ethical evaluation by standards of harm and sustainability.

Fricker's (2007) epistemic injustice framework extends critique to epistemic traditions. Traditions become problematic when they perpetuate testimonial injustice (prejudice causes credibility deficits for certain groups) or hermeneutical injustice (gaps in collective interpretive resources systematically disadvantage marginalized groups). Epistemic traditions that silence certain voices lack epistemic legitimacy. Vaditya (2018) develops this into "methodology of the oppressed"—traditions of knowledge production perpetuate subordination by treating dominant groups' knowledge as objective. Critique requires centering marginalized epistemic standpoints.

Naudts (2024) demonstrates how Young's oppression framework applies to emerging digital traditions. Algorithmic governance and data-driven decision-making systems introduce new faces of oppression—marginalizing users, rendering them powerless, perpetuating existing subordination through automated processes. This shows that tradition-critique must be dynamic, addressing emergent as well as ancient forms of domination. Even nascent technological "traditions" may require abandonment if their trajectory leads to structural subordination.

From these analyses, several normative criteria for tradition-abandonment emerge:

1. **Harm principle**: Traditions causing unnecessary suffering to humans or sentient beings without compensating moral value warrant abandonment when less harmful alternatives exist.

2. **Autonomy constraint**: Traditions systematically restricting members' capacity for self-determination—particularly when exit is costly or impossible—violate conditions of legitimate authority.

3. **Justice requirement**: Traditions perpetuating unfair distribution of social goods or institutionalizing group subordination through any of Young's five faces of oppression fail justice conditions.

4. **Epistemic legitimacy**: Traditions systematically excluding or silencing certain voices through testimonial or hermeneutical injustice lack epistemic standing.

5. **Consistency principle**: Evaluative standards must apply cross-culturally without hypocrisy or selective condemnation based on cultural origin.

Yet application of these criteria raises the unresolved tension: How do we apply universal principles without cultural imperialism? Postcolonial critiques (Narayan and Harding 2000; Radhakrishnan 2025; Alexander 2006) demonstrate that even ostensibly universal standards can serve domination. Liberal feminist critiques of non-Western traditions have served orientalist agendas. Immanent critique reproduces colonial frameworks. The very distinction between "universal" and "particular" may encode Western assumptions.

Nor can we retreat to pure relativism. As Earp demonstrates, relativism about harmful practices becomes morally intolerable—it would forbid criticism of any traditional subordination. The debate exposes a productive but unresolved tension: universal moral standards are necessary to critique harmful traditions, but their application always occurs within power relations that may reproduce domination. Neither pure universalism nor relativism succeeds. This may be a permanent feature of tradition-evaluation rather than a solvable problem—requiring phronetic judgment attending to particular contexts, power relations, and insider perspectives rather than algorithmic application of principles.

The critical literature establishes clearly that traditions *can* lack value—when they perpetuate structural domination, violate autonomy without sufficient justification, cause unjustified harm, or systematically exclude voices. But *how* to distinguish valuable from harmful traditions without reproducing domination through the very act of critique remains philosophically and practically contested. The research question "when are traditions valuable?" cannot be answered without confronting this tension between universal standards and cultural particularity, between external critique and internal reform, between respecting agency and preventing subordination.
