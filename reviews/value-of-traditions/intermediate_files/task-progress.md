- [x] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [x] Phase 3: Research 7 domains in parallel
- [x] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [x] Phase 5: Write review for each section in parallel
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-08: Phase 1 complete - Environment verified (status: ok), execution mode: Full Autopilot, working directory: reviews/value-of-traditions/
2026-01-08: Phase 2 complete - Created lit-review-plan.md (7 domains: Normative Foundations, Conservative Defenses, Liberal Critiques, Communitarian Approaches, Social Epistemology, Political Legitimacy, Critical Limitations)
