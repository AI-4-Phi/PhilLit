DOMAIN: Normative Foundations of Tradition's Value

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes the fundamental philosophical frameworks for understanding
how and why traditions generate normative value. Three major positions emerge:
(1) Tradition-constituted rationality (MacIntyre): traditions are the necessary
context for rational inquiry and virtue development, making them constitutively
valuable rather than merely instrumentally useful; (2) Conservative appeals to
tradition (Burke, Oakeshott, Honderich): traditions embody accumulated wisdom
and provide social stability, yielding both epistemic and practical authority;
(3) Liberal-critical views (Scheffler, Casal, Wall): traditions may have
conditional or context-dependent value that must be scrutinized against other
moral considerations. Recent work emphasizes the distinction between intrinsic,
instrumental, and constitutive value in assessing traditions. The temporal
dimension—how historical continuity itself generates value—remains contested,
with some arguing that longevity provides epistemic warrant while others see
it as morally neutral.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These works provide the essential conceptual toolkit for analyzing tradition's
value across domains. They establish the meta-level categories (intrinsic/
instrumental/constitutive value, authority types, temporal dimensions) that
other domains will apply to specific traditions. The MacIntyre-liberal debate
particularly illuminates how different meta-ethical frameworks generate
divergent assessments of the same traditions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with non-Western conceptions of tradition's normative
foundations. Insufficient attention to how digital/technological change affects
traditional forms of authority. The constitutive value thesis needs more
rigorous articulation beyond MacIntyre's framework.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around the intrinsic/instrumental/constitutive value distinction.
Emphasize how MacIntyre's framework contrasts with both conservative and
liberal positions. Highlight recent attempts (Scheffler, Casal, Beckstein)
to develop more nuanced accounts beyond simple dichotomies.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Tradition-constituted rationality: 4 papers (MacIntyre, D'Andrea, Beadle & Moore) - Traditions as constitutive of rational inquiry
- Conservative tradition-based authority: 5 papers (SEP Conservatism, Honderich, Bourke, Levy, Scruton-adjacent) - Tradition as epistemic and practical authority
- Liberal-critical conditional value: 5 papers (Scheffler, Casal, Wall, Kumar) - Tradition's value as conditional and context-dependent
- Living tradition concepts: 4 papers (Beckstein, Allan, Dostal, SEP Authority) - Dynamic, evolving nature of valuable traditions

  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.5860/choice.26-1486},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops the thesis that all rationality is tradition-constituted. Different philosophical traditions (Aristotelian, Augustinian, Scottish Enlightenment, liberal) embody distinct and often incommensurable conceptions of justice and practical rationality. Rational progress occurs within traditions through their capacity to resolve internal epistemic crises and to understand rival traditions better than those rivals understand themselves.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding how traditions constitute rather than merely transmit value. MacIntyre argues that traditions are not optional cultural inheritances but necessary contexts for rationality itself. This provides the strongest philosophical account of tradition's constitutive value against instrumentalist views. His framework establishes key concepts (living traditions, epistemic crises, tradition-constituted rationality) essential for this literature review's conceptual architecture.

  POSITION: Tradition-constituted rationality position. Rejects both conservative reverence for tradition as such and liberal individualism's rejection of tradition-dependence. Traditions have neither intrinsic value (independent of their rational content) nor merely instrumental value (as means to independent ends), but constitutive value as conditions for rational inquiry.

  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvpj75tx},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines three competing approaches to moral philosophy: Encyclopaedia (Enlightenment universalism seeking neutral rationality), Genealogy (Nietzschean unmasking of moral claims as power), and Tradition (Thomistic synthesis). Argues that the Encyclopaedia project failed, genealogy is self-refuting, and only tradition-based inquiry can sustain coherent moral investigation. Universities embody these conflicts institutionally.

  RELEVANCE: Extends MacIntyre's argument from Whose Justice to show how tradition's epistemological role connects to institutions and pedagogical practices. Crucial for understanding how tradition's normative force operates at multiple levels: individual reasoning, community practices, and institutional structures. The critique of "neutral" rationality strengthens the case that all normative frameworks presuppose some tradition.

  POSITION: Tradition-constituted rationality. Argues that the Enlightenment attempt to ground morality without tradition generates the fragmentation and interminable disputes characteristic of modern moral philosophy. Valuable traditions are those capable of self-criticism and development through dialectical engagement with rivals.

  volume = {24},
  number = {2},
  pages = {137--161},
  doi = {10.1111/jopp.12058},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines when and how traditions can possess legitimate moral and political authority. Distinguishes between epistemic authority (traditions as reliable guides to truth), practical authority (traditions as sources of obligations), and expressive authority (traditions as vehicles for identity). Argues that traditions can have genuine but defeasible authority that political morality must recognize while remaining compatible with critical reflection and reform.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most systematic philosophical analysis of tradition's authority claims specifically in political morality. Directly addresses the project's central question about when traditions are valuable by developing a nuanced account of different types of authority. Bridges MacIntyrean and liberal perspectives by showing how tradition's authority can be real without being absolute or immune to rational criticism.

  POSITION: Moderate perfectionist liberalism. Rejects both conservative uncritical deference and liberal dismissal of tradition. Traditions can generate genuine moral reasons for action, but these reasons are defeasible and must be weighed against competing considerations. Authority derives from both epistemic reliability and constitutive role in valuable identities.

@book{scheffler2010equality,
  author = {Scheffler, Samuel},
  title = {Equality and Tradition: Questions of Value in Moral and Political Theory},
  year = {2010},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Collection including the influential essay "The Normativity of Tradition." Argues that traditions have genuine but conditional normative force. Traditions shape personal and collective identity, but their value depends on their content and effects. Criticizes both uncritical traditionalism and the view that tradition provides no reasons at all. Develops an account of tradition's role in conferring meaning and structure to social life while maintaining that such conferral does not immunize traditions from moral criticism.

  RELEVANCE: Scheffler's work represents the most sophisticated liberal engagement with tradition's value. Unlike MacIntyre, maintains that tradition's normative force is real but derivative—traditions matter because of their role in human flourishing, not as independent sources of value. This position is essential for capturing the liberal-communitarian debate's current state. His "conditional value" approach influences recent work by Casal and others.

  POSITION: Egalitarian liberalism with communitarian sensibilities. Traditions have non-instrumental value through their identity-constituting role, but this value is conditional on traditions serving morally acceptable ends. Rejects the view that longevity or social embeddedness alone confer authority. Valuable traditions are those that enhance rather than constrain human agency.

  journal = {Res Publica},

  volume = {27},
  number = {4},
  pages = {467--490},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-020-09486-w},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and defends a conditional account of tradition's value through case studies of controversial practices. Argues against G.A. Cohen and T.M. Scanlon that we can criticize others' traditions even when our own contain comparable harms. The value traditions possess derives from their contributions to social cohesion, cultural meaning, and identity—but these contributions cannot override weightier moral considerations, especially harm to sentient beings. Tradition provides reasons for action but not decisive or exclusionary reasons.

  RELEVANCE: Exemplifies recent philosophical work extending Scheffler's conditional value thesis. Uses concrete cases to test abstract theories about tradition's normative status. Particularly valuable for showing how tradition's value interacts with other moral considerations (animal welfare, harm principles). Demonstrates that even sympathetic accounts of tradition must explain when and why tradition's value is outweighed.

  POSITION: Liberal conditionalism. Traditions have genuine but qualified value. Their contribution to social harmony and cultural identity provides prima facie reasons to maintain them, but these reasons are defeasible. The paper challenges the view that internal criticism has special status—we can legitimately criticize others' traditions even when ours are imperfect.

  number = {4},
  pages = {491--510},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a philosophical account of "living traditions" as distinct from dead or dying ones. Living traditions are characterized by: (1) continuity over time, (2) active practice and transmission, (3) internal contestation and development, (4) critical reflection by participants, and (5) capacity for adaptation. Argues that only living traditions generate the special normative force attributed to tradition; dead traditions are mere historical artifacts.

  RELEVANCE: Fills a crucial gap in tradition theory by providing criteria for distinguishing valuable living traditions from ossified or defunct ones. Addresses the question "which traditions are valuable?" rather than assuming all traditions possess equal normative status. The emphasis on internal development and critical reflection bridges MacIntyrean and liberal approaches. Essential for any account claiming traditions matter normatively.

  POSITION: Synthesizes MacIntyrean and liberal insights. Living traditions combine continuity with change, authority with contestation. The capacity for critical self-examination is internal to living traditions, not imposed externally. This view resists both conservative ossification and liberal rejection of tradition's authority.

  number = {1},
  pages = {1--17},
  doi = {10.1007/s10790-018-9636-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critical examination of Scheffler's account of tradition's normative force. Argues that Scheffler's conditional value thesis underestimates tradition's constitutive role in identity formation. While agreeing that traditions lack intrinsic value, questions whether their value can be adequately captured in instrumental terms. Proposes that traditions have "framework value"—they structure the evaluative space within which other goods are pursued.

  RELEVANCE: Represents recent philosophical refinement of debates between liberal and communitarian accounts of tradition. Shows that even liberal philosophers sympathetic to tradition struggle to categorize its normative status within standard value theory. The "framework value" concept helps explain how traditions can be normatively significant without being ends-in-themselves, advancing the project's goal of clarifying tradition's value-type.

  POSITION: Moderate communitarianism. Traditions provide the background conditions for meaningful choice and evaluation, giving them a special status that "conditional instrumental value" may not capture. More sympathetic to constitutive value claims than Scheffler, but retains liberal commitment to critical reflection.

  publisher = {Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/conservatism/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of conservative political philosophy from Burke to contemporary neo-conservatism. Identifies tradition as central to most conservative thought, but notes deep divisions: skeptical conservatives (Oakeshott) emphasize tradition as accumulated practical wisdom resisting abstract theory; rational conservatives seek theoretical justification for hierarchical social orders. Both strands value tradition, but for different reasons—epistemic humility versus substantive commitments to particular social forms.

  RELEVANCE: Essential reference for understanding how "tradition" functions in conservative thought. Shows that conservatism is not monolithic regarding tradition—different conservative thinkers offer incompatible rationales for valuing tradition. This diversity within conservatism parallels broader philosophical disagreements about tradition's normative foundations. The article provides crucial context for understanding Burke's influence and limits.

  POSITION: Encyclopedic overview rather than advocacy. Presents conservatism as valuing tradition either as: (1) source of practical wisdom superior to abstract reason (skeptical conservatism), or (2) embodiment of natural human hierarchy and social order (rational conservatism). Both contrast with liberalism's emphasis on individual autonomy and rational construction.

  year = {2021},
  publisher = {Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authority/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes political authority as the right to rule and impose duties. Distinguishes de facto authority (actual power) from legitimate authority (moral right to power). Examines various grounds for legitimate authority: consent, fair play, natural duty to support just institutions, and service conception (authority justified by serving subjects' interests). Traditional authority is assessed as one possible basis for legitimacy.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic framework for analyzing tradition's authority claims. The distinction between de facto and legitimate authority is crucial for evaluating when traditions possess genuine normative force versus mere social power. Helps clarify what it would mean for tradition to have "authority"—is it practical authority (imposing duties), epistemic authority (reliable testimony), or expressive authority (articulating identities)?

  POSITION: Neutral philosophical analysis. Authority requires justification; mere antiquity or social acceptance insufficient. Legitimate authority must serve recognizable goods or derive from fair procedures. This framework challenges conservative appeals to tradition as self-justifying while allowing that traditions might acquire authority through their beneficial effects or constitutive role in valuable social practices.

  edition = {3rd},
  publisher = {Pluto Press},
  address = {London},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctt183q5ts},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that conservatism lacks a coherent unifying principle and often masks the defense of inequality and privilege. Examines conservative thinkers from Burke to contemporary neo-conservatives, claiming their appeal to tradition serves primarily to rationalize existing social hierarchies. True conservatism's principle is preservation of inequality in well-being, not tradition per se. Tradition-talk is ideological cover for material interests.

  RELEVANCE: Represents skeptical critical perspective on conservative appeals to tradition. Important counterpoint to philosophical accounts that take tradition's authority seriously. Raises question: Is tradition's value a genuine philosophical problem or an ideological construct? While the project takes tradition seriously, Honderich's critique helps identify when tradition-appeal might mask other motivations.

  POSITION: Left-liberal skepticism about tradition. Tradition gains normative significance only derivatively from independent moral considerations (justice, equality, well-being). Conservative appeals to tradition are often bad faith arguments for maintaining privilege. Genuine inquiry requires examining what traditions actually do, not what they claim to represent.

  number = {4},
  pages = {449--475},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885117691996},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the standard narrative that Edmund Burke founded a coherent conservative tradition. Through historical analysis, shows that "conservatism" as a unified ideology is a 20th-century construction projected backward. Burke was a Whig reformer, not a conservative traditionalist. The idea of a transhistorical conservative philosophy centered on tradition is anachronistic. Different thinkers labeled "conservative" have incompatible philosophical commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding that "tradition" in conservative thought may be more contested and historically contingent than philosophical accounts assume. Raises questions about whether there is a coherent "conservative position" on tradition's value. Useful corrective to treating conservatism as a unified tradition with consistent view of tradition's authority.

  POSITION: Historical contextualism. Philosophical analyses of tradition often rely on constructed genealogies that misrepresent actual historical development. Burke's thought was more complex and context-specific than conservative tradition allows. This skepticism about conservative intellectual history parallels philosophical questions about tradition's normative status.

  volume = {14},
  number = {2},
  pages = {205--218},
  doi = {10.1017/epi.2016.8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the Burkean argument that we should defer to traditional practices because they embody accumulated wisdom tested by experience. Analyzes this as an epistemological claim about tradition's reliability. Argues that deference to tradition is rational under specific conditions: when traditions result from selection processes that track truth or goodness. However, many social traditions lack such pedigrees, having been shaped by power, accident, or processes unrelated to their merit.

  RELEVANCE: Provides epistemological framework for evaluating conservative arguments about tradition's wisdom. Distinguishes legitimate epistemic deference (to traditions with reliable selection histories) from illegitimate deference (to traditions without such histories). Essential for projects asking which traditions merit respect—the answer depends on traditions' actual causal histories, not mere longevity.

  POSITION: Qualified Burkean epistemicism. Tradition can provide evidence under specific conditions, but these conditions are often absent. The burden is on traditionalists to show that particular traditions have reliability-conferring histories. Mere survival proves little about truth or value; context matters enormously.

  address = {Aldershot},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315235851},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive exposition and defense of MacIntyre's philosophical system. Explains how MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted rationality develops from his critique of Enlightenment liberalism through his engagement with Aristotelian-Thomistic virtue ethics. Argues that MacIntyre provides the most coherent available account of moral knowledge and rational disagreement. Clarifies often-misunderstood aspects of MacIntyre's position, especially regarding relativism and tradition-transcendent truth.

  RELEVANCE: Authoritative secondary literature on MacIntyre, essential for properly understanding tradition-constituted rationality. Helps distinguish MacIntyre's position from both conservative traditionalism and postmodern relativism. Particularly valuable for explaining how living traditions can be rational inquiries rather than dogmatic systems. Central to grasping the strongest philosophical case for tradition's constitutive value.

  POSITION: Exposition and defense of MacIntyrean framework. Traditions are ongoing arguments about the good, requiring both continuity with the past and capacity for self-criticism. The apparent paradox of tradition-dependent yet truth-aiming inquiry is resolved by understanding traditions as bearers of methodological as well as substantive commitments.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies MacIntyre's framework to organizational studies. Organizations embody practices (activities with internal goods) and institutions (structures that sustain practices while pursuing external goods). Valuable organizations balance these elements. The paper extends MacIntyre's account to show how tradition operates at organizational level—good organizations maintain tradition-constituted practices while adapting to change.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how MacIntyrean concepts apply beyond moral philosophy to institutional analysis. Shows that tradition's constitutive value operates at multiple levels: individual virtue, shared practices, and organizational structures. Relevant for understanding how political and cultural traditions gain institutional embodiment. Illustrates that tradition-constituted rationality has practical institutional implications.

  POSITION: Applied MacIntyrean analysis. Organizations are tradition-bearing communities of practice. Their value depends on sustaining practices with internal goods, not merely producing external goods (profit, power). This requires organizational traditions that balance continuity with critical development.

  isbn = {9780887062063},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a phenomenological account of how past events and traditions acquire normative significance. Distinguishes types of importance: inherited, imagined, and created. Traditions gain authority not through age alone but through their role in constituting meaningful presents and futures. The past's authority is neither arbitrary (relativism) nor necessary (foundationalism) but depends on its capacity to orient action and sustain communities.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical framework for understanding how temporality relates to value. Addresses the question: why should the past matter to the present? Shows that tradition's authority emerges from the recursive relationship between inherited meanings and present interpretation. Bridges pragmatist and hermeneutic approaches to tradition.

  POSITION: Pragmatist-hermeneutic synthesis. Tradition's authority is neither given nor constructed but emerges through the interpretive practices that connect past, present, and future. The past imposes constraints (we cannot choose our inheritance) but remains open to reinterpretation (we choose what to emphasize and develop).

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition and authority in hermeneutic philosophy. Against Enlightenment prejudice against prejudice, Gadamer shows that all understanding requires pre-judgments inherited from tradition. Authority is not opposed to reason but can be its condition—we rationally submit to epistemic authority when experts know more than we do. Similarly, tradition's authority can be rational, not blind submission.

  RELEVANCE: Connects to broader project through Gadamerian hermeneutics as alternative to both conservative traditionalism and liberal rationalism. Gadamer's account of "legitimate prejudices" shows how tradition can have epistemic authority without being dogmatic. Important for understanding how interpretation always occurs within traditions even while criticizing them.

  POSITION: Hermeneutic philosophy. Understanding requires tradition-mediated pre-judgments. Authority can be rational when grounded in genuine expertise or superior wisdom. The Enlightenment's blanket rejection of authority and tradition was itself a prejudice that obscured how understanding actually works. Critical reflection occurs within, not apart from, traditions.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic survey of theories about the nature of value. Covers intrinsic vs extrinsic value, final vs instrumental value, and debates about value's metaphysical status. Clarifies that intrinsic value (value in itself) differs from final value (value as an end) and from inherent value (value in virtue of intrinsic properties). These distinctions matter for understanding what kind of value traditions might possess.

  RELEVANCE: Provides essential conceptual machinery for analyzing tradition's value type. The distinctions between intrinsic, instrumental, constitutive, and framework value recur throughout the literature. Understanding these categories is prerequisite for engaging debates about whether traditions are valuable in themselves, as means to ends, or as conditions for value-recognition. Helps clarify terminological confusions.

  POSITION: Neutral meta-ethical analysis. Presents major positions on value's nature without endorsing one. Clarifies that many apparent disagreements about tradition's value rest on different understandings of "value" itself.

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},

  doi = {10.4159/harvard.9780674065512},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces the concept of dignity from ancient Rome through Kant to contemporary human rights discourse. Shows how different traditions understand dignity differently: Roman dignitas (social rank), Christian imago dei (inherent worth), Kantian autonomy (self-legislation). Contemporary rights discourse inherits these multiple meanings, generating conceptual confusion. The book demonstrates how tradition shapes fundamental normative concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates how traditions constitute the conceptual resources for normative thought. Different traditions of dignity generate incompatible accounts of human value and rights. This exemplifies MacIntyre's thesis that moral concepts are tradition-dependent. Relevant for understanding how traditions provide vocabularies for normative discourse, not just practices or institutions.

  POSITION: Historical-conceptual analysis with hermeneutic sensibility. Moral concepts have histories embedded in traditions; understanding concepts requires understanding their genealogies. This supports neither relativism nor traditionalism but shows how normative thought operates within inherited conceptual frameworks that can be criticized but not entirely escaped.
