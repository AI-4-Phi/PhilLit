====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Social epistemology studies how social interactions, practices, norms, and
systems affect knowledge acquisition and justification. This field has moved
beyond individualistic epistemology to recognize that much of our knowledge
is socially constituted. Key debates center on testimony as a basic source of
knowledge (reductionism vs. anti-reductionism), distributed cognition and
collective intelligence, epistemic authority and trust, and epistemic
injustice. Within this domain, tradition can be understood as a form of
extended testimony—knowledge transmitted across generations through social
practices and institutions. Recent work examines how collective knowledge
systems operate, when we should trust social sources, and what epistemic
pathologies (like echo chambers, credibility deficits) emerge in social
knowledge transmission. The SEP entry on social epistemology and foundational
work by Goldman, Fricker, and Coady establish the landscape, while recent
papers explore distributed cognition (Palermos), testimonial norms (Simion),
and the social character of scientific knowledge (Longino).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the epistemic framework for evaluating tradition as a
reliable knowledge source. Social epistemology asks: When should we trust
testimony? How does knowledge distributed across communities function? What
are the epistemic virtues and vices of social learning? These questions map
directly onto Burkean arguments that tradition embodies collective wisdom.
The literature on distributed cognition and collective intelligence offers
tools for understanding how traditional practices preserve and transmit
knowledge that no individual could generate alone. Work on epistemic
injustice highlights potential pathologies of tradition (silencing dissent,
credibility deficits for marginalized groups), while literature on testimonial
reliability explores conditions under which socially transmitted beliefs are
justified.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most social epistemology focuses on contemporary scientific communities or
interpersonal testimony rather than on tradition per se. Few papers explicitly
theorize tradition as a distinct epistemic source combining features of
testimony, distributed cognition, and cultural learning. The connection
between Burkean political arguments for tradition and epistemological arguments
for testimonial reliability remains under-explored. More work is needed on
epistemic pathologies specific to tradition (conservatism bias, path
dependence) and how these differ from other forms of collective knowledge.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Connect testimony literature (reductionism debate, conditions for testimonial
justification) with distributed cognition work (how groups can know what no
individual knows) to build epistemic case for tradition. Use Fricker and
Longino to identify epistemic injustices and limitations. Consider how
cumulative cultural knowledge (Müller 2024) relates to Burkean arguments.
Contrast individualistic epistemic autonomy (Fricker 2006) with collective
epistemic benefits of testimony (Simion 2020, Kusch 2002).

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Anti-reductionism on testimony: 8 papers - We have default entitlement to
  trust testimony; testimonial knowledge is not reducible to other sources
- Reductionism on testimony: 3 papers - Testimonial justification requires
  independent evidence of speaker reliability
- Distributed virtue reliabilism: 3 papers - Groups can possess collective
  cognitive abilities and produce knowledge irreducible to individuals
- Epistemic injustice: 4 papers - Social power structures create systematic
  epistemic harms via testimonial and hermeneutical injustice

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the concept of epistemic injustice, identifying
  two forms: testimonial injustice (when prejudice causes a hearer to give
  a speaker less credibility than warranted) and hermeneutical injustice
  (when gaps in collective interpretive resources disadvantage marginalized
  groups). Argues that epistemic injustice is a distinctive ethical wrong
  that harms people specifically in their capacity as knowers. Proposes
  epistemic virtue of testimonial justice to counter credibility deficits.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding epistemic pathologies of tradition.
  If traditions systematically exclude or silence certain voices, they
  perpetuate testimonial and hermeneutical injustice. Fricker's framework
  allows us to distinguish legitimate epistemic authority of tradition from
  unjust credibility excesses given to dominant groups. Her analysis of how
  social power distorts epistemic practices applies directly to evaluating
  when tradition becomes epistemically unreliable due to structural injustice.

  POSITION: Foundational work in social epistemology identifying ethical
  dimensions of epistemic practices and power relations in knowledge
  transmission.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends anti-reductionist account of testimony, arguing
  that testimony is a basic source of knowledge on par with perception and
  memory, not reducible to inductive inference about speaker reliability.
  Claims we have a priori presumptive right to trust testimony absent
  defeating evidence. Challenges Humean reductionism by showing it leads to
  vicious circularity—we need testimony to learn about testimony's
  reliability. Argues most of our knowledge depends essentially on testimony.

  RELEVANCE: Coady's anti-reductionism provides philosophical foundation
  for trusting tradition without requiring each generation to independently
  verify inherited beliefs. His arguments that testimony is epistemically
  basic support view that traditional knowledge can be justified even when
  recipients lack direct evidence. The scale of our dependence on testimony
  that Coady emphasizes parallels our dependence on tradition—both are
  inescapable features of human epistemic life.

  volume = {55},
  number = {4},
  pages = {783--801},
  doi = {10.1111/nous.12337},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends anti-reductionism about testimony through
  "testimonial contractarianism"—the view that speakers and hearers operate
  under implicit social contract whereby speakers are obligated to comply
  with norms governing speech acts (assert only what you know), and hearers
  are entitled to presume compliance. This explains why testimonial
  entitlement is "easy to come by" despite speakers' freedom to lie.
  Knowledge-first approach: norms of assertion are knowledge norms, making
  testimonial default rational.

  RELEVANCE: Simion's social contract framework applies naturally to tradition,
  which involves implicit transgenerational contracts about preserving and
  transmitting knowledge. If traditions operate under norms requiring
  fidelity to inherited wisdom, participants may be rationally entitled to
  trust traditional teachings by default. The knowledge-first approach
  suggests that epistemic evaluation of tradition should focus on whether
  traditional practices reliably transmit knowledge, not merely true belief.

  POSITION: Contemporary defense of anti-reductionism grounded in knowledge-first
  epistemology and social contract theory.

  number = {4},
  pages = {169--195},
  doi = {10.5840/jphil2022119413},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Criticizes mainstream social epistemology for adopting
  "thin" conception of sociality that merely adds testimony and disagreement
  to individualistic epistemology. Argues scientific practice reveals "thick"
  sociality where interaction among researchers is central to knowledge-making,
  disagreement and testimony are resources rather than problems, and
  determining what counts as evidence emerges through discursive interactions.
  Challenges individualistic assumptions about cognitive agents and starting
  points for epistemological reflection.

  RELEVANCE: Longino's critique of thin sociality applies to analyses of
  tradition that treat it merely as aggregated individual testimony. Her
  emphasis on thick social processes—where evidence standards and knowledge
  emerge through community interaction—captures how traditions function as
  collective epistemic systems. Traditional practices embody communal
  determinations of what counts as evidence and how to evaluate it, developed
  through generations of discursive interaction. This suggests traditions
  require social-processual rather than individualistic epistemic analysis.

  pages = {1481--1508},
  doi = {10.1007/s10670-020-00258-9},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Combines virtue reliabilism with distributed cognition
  hypothesis to argue for strong epistemic anti-individualism. Epistemic
  collaborations (research teams, transactive memory systems) produce beliefs
  with positive epistemic standing through mutual interactions of members,
  where this standing is irreducible collective property. Groups themselves
  can be epistemic agents possessing collective cognitive abilities. This
  "distributed virtue reliabilism" shows how collaborative knowledge is
  distinct from knowledge aggregated from individuals.

  RELEVANCE: Palermos's framework directly supports epistemic value of
  tradition understood as distributed cognitive system. Traditional practices
  constitute epistemic collaborations where knowledge emerges from mutual
  interactions across generations, with cognitive labor distributed among
  participants. The collective cognitive abilities embodied in traditions
  (craft knowledge, institutional wisdom) may exceed what any individual
  possesses. Distributed virtue reliabilism provides theoretical foundation
  for claiming traditions can know things no individual member knows.

  reliabilism, arguing group knowledge is irreducible to individual knowledge.

  number = {4},
  pages = {496--516},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2024.2356588},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that cumulative cultural knowledge (CCK)—knowledge
  acquired through social learning and refined over generations—deserves
  epistemic credit beyond standard testimony accounts. CCK transmission
  involves non-testimonial cultural learning (observation, imitation,
  participation) not captured by testimony-focused epistemology. Agents
  deserve epistemic credit for promoting community's epistemic need for
  efficient, safe CCK transmission. Critiques Greco's knowledge-economy
  framework for excessive focus on testimony; proposes broader account of
  cultural learning.

  RELEVANCE: Müller's focus on cumulative cultural knowledge directly
  addresses tradition's epistemic value. Traditions are paradigm cases of
  CCK—knowledge refined over generations through cultural learning. His
  argument that CCK transmission deserves epistemic credit provides
  philosophical foundation for valuing tradition's role in preserving and
  transmitting knowledge unavailable through individual inquiry. The emphasis
  on non-testimonial learning (learning by doing, apprenticeship) captures
  how much traditional knowledge operates.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "communitarian value-driven epistemology" drawing
  on Craig's epistemic genealogy and Barnes/Shapin's sociology of knowledge.
  Argues testimony should be understood as collective good underwritten by
  intrinsic values of accuracy and sincerity. Protoknowledge attributions
  function as ascriptions of honor within communities. Defends Craig's
  position against Kvanvig by treating testimony as social institution with
  interrelated epistemic and social values. Knowledge attributions are
  intertwined with attributions of freedom and reliability.

  RELEVANCE: Kusch's communitarian approach illuminates how traditional
  knowledge functions within communities. Treating testimony as collective
  good applies to tradition—traditional knowledge is communal resource
  underwritten by norms of accuracy and sincerity across generations. The
  connection between knowledge attributions and honor/reliability captures
  how traditions confer epistemic authority. His integration of epistemic
  and social values suggests evaluating tradition requires understanding
  both truth-conduciveness and role in constituting community identity.

  number = {515},
  pages = {887--915},
  doi = {10.1093/mind/fzz017},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues contemporary epistemology's weak anti-individualism
  is inadequate for understanding human knowledge production and transmission.
  Dispositions and norms that are knowledge-conducive in familiar cases
  (individual reasoning, testimony) may not be generally knowledge-conducive.
  Individual-level epistemic vices can be epistemic virtues in common social
  contexts due to distributed cognition and division of cognitive labor.
  Epistemology must become more deeply and pervasively social to capture
  how knowledge actually works.

  RELEVANCE: Levy and Alfano's argument for deeply social epistemology
  challenges individualistic evaluation of tradition. What appears as
  epistemic vice at individual level (uncritical acceptance of inherited
  beliefs) may be epistemic virtue at collective level (preserving hard-won
  knowledge, maintaining cultural stability for knowledge accumulation).
  Their emphasis on division of cognitive labor applies to tradition—
  different generations and roles specialize in different aspects of
  knowledge preservation and application. Suggests evaluating tradition
  requires examining collective epistemic outcomes, not just individual
  rationality.

  volume = {59},
  pages = {225--250},
  doi = {10.1017/S1358246100009620},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends epistemic autonomy ideal against uncritical
  acceptance of testimony. Argues hearers should critically monitor testimony
  for signs of insincerity or incompetence rather than accepting it by
  default. Reductionist position: testimonial justification requires hearer
  to possess evidence of speaker's reliability, either case-specific or
  general inductive evidence. Critical stance preserves epistemic autonomy—
  subjects drawing own conclusions from their evidence. Challenges
  anti-reductionist presumptive right to trust testimony.

  RELEVANCE: Fricker's defense of epistemic autonomy represents key objection
  to uncritical acceptance of tradition. If epistemic autonomy requires
  critically assessing inherited beliefs rather than accepting them by
  default, this challenges Burkean deference to tradition. However, her
  focus on individual autonomy may overlook collective epistemic benefits
  of tradition (distributed cognition, cumulative knowledge). The tension
  between individual epistemic autonomy and collective epistemic achievements
  is central to evaluating tradition's epistemic value.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues for epistemic value of expert autonomy while
  acknowledging social nature of inquiry. Experts in epistemic community
  should evaluate evidence themselves rather than deferring to others.
  Develops notion of "expert acceptance" as appropriate epistemic stance
  for experts. Expert autonomy makes joint testimony more reliable,
  benefiting both laypeople and experts in other fields. Balances Enlightenment
  autonomy ideal with recognition of distributed knowledge and social
  expertise.

  RELEVANCE: Dellsén's framework illuminates division of epistemic labor
  within traditions. While laypeople may appropriately defer to traditional
  wisdom, those charged with maintaining and developing tradition (scholars,
  practitioners, elders) require autonomy to critically evaluate inherited
  knowledge. This suggests tradition's epistemic value depends on maintaining
  appropriate balance: experts exercising autonomy to test and refine
  traditional knowledge while preserving benefits of collective wisdom.
  Pure deference undermines reliability; autonomous expertise within
  tradition enhances it.

  volume = {62},
  number = {4},
  pages = {583--607},
  doi = {10.1111/sjp.12600},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Mary Shepherd's 19th-century nonreductionist
  account of testimony. Shepherd argues hearers are caused and justified to
  regard testimony as true by default absent undefeated defeaters, without
  requiring positive evidence of speaker reliability. Her commitment to
  epistemic autonomy explains why, despite accepting testimony about events,
  she denies we should base philosophical judgments on others' authority or
  common sense. A priori right to trust testimony about events doesn't
  extend to metaphysical principles.

  RELEVANCE: Shepherd's position offers nuanced view of testimony's
  epistemic role relevant to tradition. Default trust in testimony about
  empirical matters (what happened) may not justify deference on fundamental
  philosophical/metaphysical questions (why things are as they are). Applied
  to tradition: we may be entitled to trust traditional empirical knowledge
  (practices, techniques) while maintaining autonomy on theoretical
  justifications. This distinguishes epistemic value of tradition as
  repository of practical wisdom from problematic deference to tradition
  as philosophical authority.

  pages = {124--149},
  doi = {10.1111/sjp.12634},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges standard reductionist interpretation of Hume
  on testimony. Argues Hume's epistemology involves two ways of acquiring
  beliefs: probabilistic assessment (causal inference) and sympathetic
  transmission. Sympathy transmits testimonial beliefs acquired uncritically
  from others, providing background against which probabilistic assessment
  operates. Sympathy integrates causal reasoning with socially constructed
  selves and moral lives. As children and adults we imbibe beliefs from
  others through sympathy, not causal inference about testifier reliability.

  RELEVANCE: O'Brien's analysis of sympathy captures non-inferential
  transmission of traditional beliefs. Much traditional knowledge is acquired
  through sympathetic identification with community rather than rational
  assessment of evidence. This suggests tradition operates partly through
  non-rational but epistemically legitimate processes (enculturation,
  habituation). However, raises question whether sympathetically acquired
  traditional beliefs are genuinely justified or merely caused. The
  integration of sympathy with causal reasoning suggests tradition's
  epistemic value lies in providing framework for evidence evaluation, not
  replacing it.

  belief transmission alongside evidential reasoning.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops novel epistemic justification for including
  testimony in deliberative democracy. While some defend testimony on
  grounds of democratic inclusion, this paper argues testimony has intrinsic
  epistemic value: introducing new information, enabling deliberators to
  grasp connections between particular and general, and inviting imaginative
  engagement with others' experiences. These epistemic benefits provide
  reasons for including testimony beyond procedural fairness.

  RELEVANCE: Chick's argument for testimony's epistemic value applies to
  tradition's role in collective decision-making. Traditional narratives and
  testimony introduce information about past consequences of actions, enable
  grasping connections between particular historical cases and general
  principles, and invite imaginative engagement with ancestral experiences.
  This suggests tradition's epistemic value for communities includes enriching
  deliberative resources beyond what present members could generate. However,
  limited to deliberative contexts; doesn't address whether tradition itself

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes testimony debate (reductionism vs. anti-reductionism,
  communitarian epistemology) through inferentialist lens following Sellars
  and Brandom. Testimony is fundamental shared knowledge source requiring
  dialogical perspective with deontic statuses and attitudes. Reformulates
  "space of reasons" socially—understanding testimony requires examining
  formal structure of "giving and asking for reasons" that establishes
  epistemic entitlements and commitments in communicative practices.

  RELEVANCE: Giovagnoli's inferentialist approach illuminates tradition's
  role in "space of reasons." Traditional beliefs carry deontic commitments—
  inheriting tradition involves undertaking responsibility to preserve and
  transmit knowledge, making oneself answerable to community standards.
  Tradition structures the game of giving and asking for reasons by
  establishing what counts as reason, what requires justification, what can
  be taken for granted. This suggests tradition's epistemic value lies partly
  in constituting normative framework for rational discourse itself.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces history of "social epistemology" from Shera (1951)
  through Goldman and Fuller traditions. Argues both mainstream traditions
  are problematic as genuine social epistemology. Authentic social epistemology
  is alternative to individualist epistemologies with roots in Hegel, Marx,
  Peirce, and development through Kuhn, pragmatism, hermeneutics, critical
  theory, and feminism. Social epistemology represents alternative to
  positivism. Shera's vision best represents social epistemology, though
  needed alternatives to positivism (developed 1962) to be realized.

  RELEVANCE: Hjørland's historical analysis helps situate tradition within
  social epistemology. The critique of individualism and the connection to
  hermeneutics and historical consciousness (Hegel) align with understanding
  tradition as socially constituted knowledge. His emphasis on alternatives
  to positivism suggests evaluating tradition requires interpretive,
  historically situated epistemology rather than purely naturalistic analysis.
  The connection to Kuhn's paradigms suggests traditions function like
  paradigms—frameworks constituting what counts as knowledge and evidence.

  epistemic standards. Challenges stereotype that traditional societies

  CORE ARGUMENT: First comprehensive study of Wittgenstein's implications

  challenges. Shows how Wittgenstein challenges individualistic epistemology
  that has dominated philosophy since Descartes. Applies Wittgensteinian
  insights to contemporary social epistemology including epistemic injustice
  and framework relativism.

  RELEVANCE: Wittgenstein's emphasis on practices, forms of life, and
  framework propositions illuminates tradition's epistemic status. His
  notion that some beliefs are not justified by evidence but constitute
  framework for evidence evaluation applies to tradition—traditional beliefs
  often function as "hinges" making inquiry possible rather than requiring
  justification themselves. This suggests some traditional knowledge is
  epistemically basic, grounding rather than requiring justification.
  Framework-relative epistemology could explain both tradition's epistemic
  value and limits.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops Husserl's notion of "secondary experience" as
  alternative to mainstream characterization of testimony as "transfer of
  belief." Argues testimony is best understood as sharing of experience
  rather than belief transfer. Provides systematic analysis of Husserl's
  Appendix XII (Husserliana 15) and integrates with Cartesian Meditations
  and Experience and Judgment. Claims Husserl's view is superior to majority
  view in contemporary epistemology.

  RELEVANCE: Husserl's "secondary experience" framework offers richer
  understanding of traditional knowledge transmission. Tradition involves
  sharing experiences across generations, not merely transferring propositional
  beliefs. Apprenticeship, ritual participation, and cultural practices
  transmit experiential knowledge that cannot be reduced to testimony about
  propositions. This phenomenological approach captures how traditional
  knowledge includes embodied, practical, and experiential dimensions that
  purely belief-focused epistemology misses. Suggests evaluating tradition
  requires phenomenology of cultural experience.

  POSITION: Phenomenological alternative to standard testimony epistemology
  emphasizing shared experience over belief transfer.
