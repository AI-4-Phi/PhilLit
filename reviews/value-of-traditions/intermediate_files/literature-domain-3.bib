====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Liberal critiques of tradition form an essential counterpoint to conservative
and communitarian defenses of tradition's value. This domain explores the
deep tension between liberal values—autonomy, rationality, individual rights,
gender equality—and traditional practices that may constrain these values.
Three main strands emerge: (1) feminist critiques exemplified by Susan Okin's
famous question "Is multiculturalism bad for women?", which argues that
cultural group rights can perpetuate women's subordination within patriarchal
traditions; (2) liberal education debates about whether fostering children's
critical autonomy threatens faith-based communities or is essential for
liberal citizenship; and (3) liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka, Parekh)
which attempts to reconcile recognition of cultural traditions with liberal
commitments to equality and individual rights. Recent work explores when
traditions become "harmful cultural practices" that liberal states must
regulate or prohibit. The debate centers on whether liberalism can
accommodate valuable traditions at all, or whether liberal principles
necessarily trump traditional authority.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is crucial for establishing *when traditions are NOT valuable*—the
critical negative case against the conservative thesis. Liberal theorists
provide principled grounds for rejecting traditions that violate autonomy,
perpetuate domination, or harm vulnerable members (especially women and
children). The tension between tradition and autonomy illuminates boundary
conditions: traditions may be valuable only insofar as they are compatible
with individual liberty, rational reflection, and substantive equality. This
provides the normative framework for distinguishing acceptable from
unacceptable traditions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers directly engage with when liberal accommodation of tradition might
be justified beyond mere toleration. The debate often polarizes into
"tradition vs. autonomy" rather than exploring synthesis. Limited engagement
with non-Western liberal traditions or postcolonial perspectives on how
liberal critiques of tradition can serve assimilationist agendas.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Contrast liberal autonomy-based objections with conservative defenses of
tradition's epistemic and constitutive value. Consider whether the debate is
resolvable or reflects genuinely conflicting values. Examine the "internal
exit" problem: can traditions reform from within while maintaining identity,
or must liberal states impose change from outside?

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Feminist critique (Okin, Narayan): 7 papers - Traditions often patriarchal,
  group rights harm women, liberal principles should override cultural claims
- Liberal multiculturalism (Kymlicka, Parekh, Carens): 6 papers - Selective
  accommodation possible, distinguish internal restrictions from external
  protections, cultural membership matters for autonomy
- Liberal education (MacMullen, Franklin-Hall, Marples): 5 papers - Autonomy
  education necessary for citizenship, tension with faith-based schooling,
  rational reflection as core liberal value

@article{okin1999multiculturalism,
  author = {Okin, Susan Moller},
  title = {Is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?},
  journal = {Boston Review},
  year = {1999},
  volume = {22},
  number = {5},
  pages = {25--28},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Okin argues that most cultures are patriarchal and that
  granting special group rights to minority cultures often comes at the
  expense of women within those groups. She contends that multiculturalist
  policies protecting cultural practices can perpetuate the subordination of
  women through practices like forced marriage, polygamy, and unequal
  inheritance rights. The liberal commitment to gender equality should
  override cultural group claims when traditions violate women's rights.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational feminist critique of tradition from a
  liberal perspective, establishing the core tension between cultural
  preservation and women's autonomy. Essential for showing when liberal values
  must trump traditional practices. Okin's argument provides the strongest
  case for liberal skepticism about tradition's value when traditions
  perpetuate gender inequality. Her work directly addresses the research
  question by identifying conditions under which traditions are NOT valuable.

  POSITION: Liberal feminist critique—traditions valuable only if compatible
  with gender equality and women's autonomy; cultural group rights
  problematic.

  pages = {205--221},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1467-8675.2011.00634.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lépinard revisits Okin's critique of multiculturalism to
  examine tensions in liberal feminist conceptions of autonomy. She argues
  that Okin's framework relies on a problematic conception of the autonomous
  feminist subject that fails to account for how women's agency operates
  within cultural contexts. The paper explores whether liberal feminism can
  recognize women's situated agency without abandoning its commitment to
  autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Provides internal critique of liberal feminist approach to
  tradition, questioning whether autonomy-based arguments adequately capture
  how women negotiate traditional practices. Important for nuancing the simple
  "tradition vs. autonomy" dichotomy and considering whether women can
  exercise agency within traditional frameworks. Complicates the research
  question by suggesting liberal autonomy may not fully capture when
  traditions are valuable to women themselves.

  POSITION: Critical liberal feminism—questions whether liberal autonomy
  framework adequately addresses women's situated agency within traditions.

  title = {Decentering the Center: Philosophy for a Multicultural, Postcolonial, and Feminist World},
  publisher = {Indiana University Press},
  year = {2000},
  address = {Bloomington},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This collection, edited by Uma Narayan and Sandra Harding,
  critiques Western-centric feminist and philosophical frameworks. Narayan's
  contributions examine how liberal feminist critiques of non-Western
  traditions can serve colonial and orientalist agendas, essentializing "Third
  World women" as passive victims. The book argues for attention to how women
  within traditional communities resist and renegotiate practices, rather than
  viewing traditions monolithically as oppressive.

  RELEVANCE: Essential postcolonial feminist perspective that questions
  whether liberal critiques of tradition perpetuate power asymmetries. Shows
  how the "tradition vs. modernity" frame can obscure women's actual
  experiences and agency. Relevant for understanding limits of liberal
  critique and how arguments about tradition's harm can serve problematic
  political agendas. Challenges simplistic liberal rejection of tradition.

  POSITION: Postcolonial feminism—critiques Western liberal feminism's
  approach to non-Western traditions as potentially orientalist.

@article{taylor2019liberalism,
  author = {Taylor, Lynda},
  title = {Is Liberalism Bad for Women? Reclaiming Susan Okin's Democratic Feminist Thesis},
  journal = {Polity},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {51},
  number = {2},
  pages = {288--320},
  doi = {10.1086/703041},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Taylor reinterprets Okin's "Is multiculturalism bad for
  women?" essay to excavate a democratic (rather than purely liberal) feminist
  argument. She argues that Okin's position is not simply that liberal
  principles should trump cultural practices, but that women within minority
  cultures must have voice in political processes that affect them. The paper
  critiques purely judgment-based liberal approaches in favor of democratic
  dialogue with the most vulnerable.

  RELEVANCE: Offers sophisticated reinterpretation of Okin showing that the
  liberal feminist critique may be compatible with democratic participation by
  women within traditional communities. Relevant for understanding whether
  liberal critique of tradition must be imposed externally or can emerge from
  internal democratic processes. Suggests middle ground between liberal
  imposition and uncritical cultural accommodation.

  POSITION: Democratic feminism—emphasizes voice of women within minority
  cultures rather than external liberal judgment.

  volume = {4},
  number = {1},
  pages = {35--47},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.00034},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Carens argues that liberalism need not be culturally neutral
  and that liberal theory should take cultural membership seriously as an
  important good. He contends that cultural traditions provide context of
  choice essential for meaningful autonomy. Liberals can support certain
  cultural group rights while maintaining commitment to individual rights and
  equality, distinguishing "external protections" (legitimate) from "internal
  restrictions" (problematic).

  RELEVANCE: Represents liberal multiculturalist attempt to reconcile cultural
  traditions with liberal values. Argues that traditions can be valuable as
  contexts of choice even from liberal autonomy perspective. Important for
  showing that liberal position need not be wholesale rejection of tradition—
  some accommodation possible. Addresses research question by suggesting
  conditions under which traditions are valuable even from liberal standpoint.

  POSITION: Liberal multiculturalism—cultural contexts valuable for autonomy,
  selective accommodation of traditions compatible with liberalism.

  number = {1},
  pages = {54--62},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-8675.00036},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Parekh explores tensions between universal citizenship and
  cultural particularity, arguing that liberal citizenship theory has been too
  quick to subordinate cultural identity to universal norms. He contends that
  traditions shape moral reasoning and that intercultural dialogue, rather
  than abstract liberal principles, should guide judgments about which
  traditional practices are acceptable. Some accommodation of tradition is
  necessary for genuine inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Provides communitarian-influenced critique of liberal approach to
  tradition, arguing for more robust accommodation of cultural difference.
  Challenges liberal assumption that autonomy and rational reflection should
  always trump traditional authority. Important counterpoint to Okin's
  position. Suggests that liberal critique of tradition may itself reflect
  cultural biases rather than universal rationality.

  POSITION: Critical multiculturalism—questions liberal privileging of
  autonomy over tradition, argues for dialogical approach to intercultural
  judgment.

  number = {1},
  pages = {109--115},
  doi = {10.1177/146879680100100112},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In this review of his own book, Parekh defends cultural
  diversity as intrinsic value rather than merely instrumental good. He argues
  that liberal, communitarian, and civic republican theories all inadequately
  address cultural pluralism because they fail to recognize that cultural
  traditions constitute distinct ways of organizing life that cannot be
  evaluated solely by external liberal standards. Intercultural dialogue
  should replace liberal adjudication.

  RELEVANCE: Major theoretical statement of multiculturalist alternative to
  liberal approach. Argues traditions have intrinsic value as distinct forms
  of human flourishing. Directly challenges liberal critique by questioning
  whether liberal principles (autonomy, equality) should serve as universal
  standards for evaluating traditions. Essential for understanding whether
  research question presupposes liberal framework or can consider alternatives.

  POSITION: Cultural pluralism—traditions valuable as distinct forms of life,
  resist universal liberal standards.

@book{kymlicka1995multicultural,
  author = {Kymlicka, Will},
  title = {Multicultural Citizenship: A Liberal Theory of Minority Rights},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {1995},
  address = {Oxford},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kymlicka develops liberal defense of certain cultural group
  rights, distinguishing national minorities (entitled to self-government
  rights) from immigrant groups (entitled to polyethnic rights). He argues
  that cultural membership provides context of choice essential for autonomy,
  but emphasizes that group rights must not violate individual rights of
  members. Traditions valuable when they support rather than constrain
  individual freedom.

  RELEVANCE: The most influential liberal multiculturalist theory, attempting
  to reconcile liberal values with accommodation of cultural traditions. Shows
  that liberalism can value cultural contexts while maintaining priority of
  individual autonomy. Establishes framework for distinguishing valuable from
  problematic traditional practices based on whether they enable or constrain
  individual choice. Central to research question of when traditions are
  valuable from liberal perspective.

  POSITION: Liberal multiculturalism—selective accommodation of traditions as
  contexts of choice, priority of individual rights over group claims.

  number = {4},
  pages = {527--546},
  doi = {10.1177/14687968231151455},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This introduction to special issue takes stock of Kymlicka's
  liberal multiculturalism 25 years later, examining recent developments in
  theory of minority rights. The authors identify three evolving dimensions:
  normative foundations (beyond just autonomy), practical categories of
  minorities, and fact-sensitive methodology. They argue liberal
  multiculturalism remains viable but requires updating to address internal
  critiques and changing social realities.

  RELEVANCE: Recent assessment of liberal multiculturalism's viability,
  showing continued evolution of liberal attempts to accommodate tradition.
  Relevant for understanding current state of debate about when liberal
  accommodation of tradition is justified. Indicates that simple "tradition
  vs. autonomy" framing is giving way to more nuanced positions within liberal
  theory itself.

  POSITION: Contemporary liberal multiculturalism—recognition that liberal
  accommodation of tradition requires more complex foundations than autonomy
  alone.

  number = {2},
  pages = {219--250},
  doi = {10.1017/s0034670500051986},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: O'Neill critiques liberal multiculturalist responses to the
  Rushdie affair, arguing that Kymlicka, Taylor, and Walzer's theories fail
  when confronted with demands to restrict freedom of expression in the name
  of protecting religious traditions. He contends that liberal multiculturalism
  collapses into either illiberal accommodation or abandonment of cultural
  recognition when traditions conflict sharply with core liberal freedoms.

  RELEVANCE: Important test case showing limits of liberal accommodation of
  tradition when traditional norms (e.g., blasphemy restrictions) directly
  conflict with liberal freedoms. Demonstrates that liberal multiculturalism
  faces hard cases where no reconciliation seems possible. Relevant for
  understanding boundary conditions—when traditions cannot be accommodated
  without abandoning liberal commitments. Illuminates the research question's
  negative cases.

  POSITION: Liberal critique of multiculturalism—questions whether liberal
  accommodation of tradition is coherent when serious conflicts arise.

  volume = {39},
  number = {3},
  pages = {400--419},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.12563},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Franklin-Hall defends education for rational autonomy against
  critics who claim it privileges Enlightenment values over faith and
  tradition. He argues that critical rational reflection is not a partisan
  comprehensive doctrine but something everyone already relies on in everyday
  reasoning. Teaching children to reason well is respecting them as reasoning
  beings. This justification avoids claiming autonomy is intrinsically
  valuable, grounding it instead in universal features of human reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: Key defense of liberal education for autonomy against
  traditionalist objections. Shows how liberal theorists respond to charge
  that autonomy education undermines traditional communities. Directly
  addresses tension between liberal values (rationality, critical thinking)
  and tradition (faith, inherited authority). Illuminates whether liberal
  commitment to autonomy necessarily conflicts with valuable traditions or can
  be reconciled.

  POSITION: Liberal education theory—rational autonomy not sectarian but
  universal feature of reasoning, education should develop this capacity.

  number = {2},
  pages = {133--147},
  doi = {10.1080/13644360500154177},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Marples argues that faith-based schools violate children's
  rights to open future and autonomous development. He contends that religious
  education within comprehensive faith traditions constrains children's
  capacity for independent moral reasoning and exposes them to indoctrination.
  Liberal states should not fund schools that prioritize religious tradition
  over children's developing autonomy, even if parents desire such education.

  RELEVANCE: Strong liberal argument against accommodation of religious
  traditions in education, based on children's rights to autonomy. Represents
  uncompromising liberal position that children's individual rights trump
  both parental religious freedom and communal tradition. Relevant for
  understanding most restrictive liberal view—traditions not valuable when
  they constrain children's development of autonomous reasoning capacity.

  traditional religious authority and parental rights.

  number = {5},
  pages = {1071--1093},
  doi = {10.1007/s11098-018-1071-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schouten examines whether political liberals (following
  Rawls) can justify education for autonomy solely on citizenship grounds,
  without appealing to autonomy as comprehensive good. She argues that
  citizenship-based arguments are insufficient—they fail to justify the full
  range of autonomy-promoting education that liberals want. Political
  liberalism may need to embrace perfectionist elements regarding autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Sophisticated examination of whether liberal arguments for
  autonomy education can avoid imposing on traditional communities. Shows
  internal tensions in liberal attempts to remain neutral among comprehensive
  doctrines (including traditional religious worldviews) while promoting
  autonomy. Relevant for understanding whether liberal critique of tradition
  is necessarily perfectionist—imposing contested liberal values—or can be
  neutrally justified.

  POSITION: Political liberalism—questions whether liberal education can be
  justified without perfectionist autonomy claims that conflict with tradition.

  number = {2},
  pages = {113--122},
  doi = {10.1080/01416200701830947},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pike argues that liberal citizenship education itself
  requires a kind of "faith"—commitment to democratic values that cannot be
  fully grounded in reason alone. He questions the liberal distinction between
  religious faith (which liberalism views skeptically) and civic faith (which
  liberalism requires). This challenges the asymmetry in liberal critiques of
  traditional religious authority while demanding acceptance of liberal
  political authority.

  RELEVANCE: Interesting challenge to liberal critique of tradition from
  within liberal education debates. Suggests that liberal autonomy and
  rationality may not be as distinctly opposed to faith and tradition as
  liberal theory assumes. Relevant for questioning whether liberal values can
  serve as neutral arbiters of tradition's worth, or whether they too rest on
  contested comprehensive commitments. Complicates the research question's
  liberal framework.

  its own form of faith, questioning liberal-traditional dichotomy.

  pages = {257--275},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01450.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vanderheiden argues that ecological limits require
  rethinking liberal conceptions of autonomy and personal space. Most
  consumption choices make claims on finite ecological resources, meaning they
  affect others and cannot be considered purely private matters. This justifies
  collective limits on lifestyle choices, including traditional consumption
  patterns, based on distributive justice and ecological sustainability.

  RELEVANCE: Novel application of liberal justice theory showing how liberal
  values can justify constraining traditional practices (consumption patterns,
  land use, resource extraction) based on their ecological impacts. Relevant
  as example of how liberal principles beyond autonomy (distributive justice,
  harm principle) can ground critiques of traditional practices. Shows that
  liberal critique of tradition need not rely solely on autonomy arguments but
  can invoke justice and sustainability.

  traditional practices with unsustainable ecological impacts.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Song reviews debates over gender and multiculturalism,
  examining how liberal theories can address tensions between gender equality
  and cultural group rights. She argues that rather than simply privileging
  liberal values, political theory should attend to actual processes of
  contestation and change within minority communities. Exit rights and internal
  democratic deliberation matter more than external liberal judgment.

  RELEVANCE: Proposes middle-ground approach between liberal imposition and
  uncritical accommodation of tradition. Emphasizes exit rights and internal
  voice as mechanisms for reconciling tradition with autonomy. Relevant for
  understanding procedural liberal responses to tradition that focus on
  enabling agency rather than substantively evaluating traditional practices.
  Addresses research question by suggesting conditions (exit, voice) under
  which traditions can be valuable even if they conflict with some liberal
  norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Jawoniyi argues that religious education in liberal
  democracies should employ epistemic egalitarianism—presenting religious
  traditions as competing claims without privileging any. This approach
  facilitates critical thinking and rational autonomy while respecting
  children's right to an open future. Religious education should expose
  children to diverse traditions rather than socialize them into particular
  faith.

  RELEVANCE: Clear articulation of liberal approach to religious tradition in
  education—traditions should be studied critically rather than transmitted
  authoritatively. Shows how liberal commitment to autonomy translates into
  educational practice that treats traditions as objects of rational reflection
  rather than sources of binding authority. Relevant for understanding liberal
  view of tradition's proper place—traditions valuable as options to consider,
  not as frameworks that precede choice.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bilge analyzes how discourses of gender equality and sexual
  freedom were mobilized during Quebec's "reasonable accommodation" crisis to

  This represents a new form of "sexual nationalism" that weaponizes liberal
  values.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis showing how liberal critique of "illiberal"
  traditions can serve problematic political purposes. Important for
  questioning whose interests are served by liberal opposition to traditional
  practices. Relevant for understanding that debate about tradition's value is
  not purely philosophical but embedded in power relations. Challenges whether

  doi = {10.1177/14687968251362252},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Godman challenges Okin's thesis, arguing that multiculturalism
  is actually good for women in three ways: (1) alternative frameworks
  (cosmopolitanism, liberal nationalism) can also be bad for women; (2) much
  feminist advocacy by minority women happens through their cultural membership;
  (3) cultural diversity has epistemic value for feminist problem-solving.
  Liberal feminism should embrace rather than oppose multiculturalism.

  RELEVANCE: Recent direct response to Okin's foundational critique, arguing
  that traditions and cultural contexts can support rather than undermine
  women's equality. Relevant for considering whether liberal feminist objection
  to tradition is too sweeping. Shows that relationship between tradition and
  women's autonomy is more complex than simple opposition. Important recent
  contribution suggesting traditions can be valuable for feminist goals.

  POSITION: Feminist multiculturalism—cultural traditions can support women's
  equality and feminist advocacy, not merely constrain them.
