DOMAIN: Metaphilosophy and the Methodology of Philosophy
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 5, Medium: 9, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: IEP, SEP, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Metaphilosophy concerns the nature of philosophical inquiry itself, including
the methods philosophers use, the status of philosophical knowledge, and the
relationship between philosophy and other disciplines. This domain has seen
renewed interest in the 21st century, particularly through debates about
philosophical methodology, philosophical progress, and the diversity of
philosophical traditions. Major positions include: (1) Naturalistic approaches
that view philosophy as continuous with science (Williamson); (2) Conceptual
approaches emphasizing analysis and linguistic methods; (3) Pragmatist
approaches focused on the practical consequences of philosophical inquiry; and
(4) Pluralist approaches recognizing multiple valid methodologies and traditions.

Recent work (2022-2025) shows increased attention to global philosophy,
critiques of Eurocentrism in philosophical canons, and debates about ideal vs.
non-ideal theory. The question of philosophical progress remains contentious,
with some defending cumulative progress (Williamson, Lewin) and others
emphasizing historically situated, non-cumulative inquiry. Contemporary
metaphilosophy also grapples with the role of intuitions, experimental methods,
and the relationship between first-order philosophy and metaphilosophical
reflection.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the overarching framework for understanding how literature
reviews function in philosophy. If philosophy has distinctive methods that differ
from empirical sciences, then philosophical literature reviews must be understood
in light of those methods. The debates about philosophical progress, the role of
the literature, and different metaphilosophical positions (naturalism, pragmatism,
etc.) directly inform how we should conceive the methodology and ethics of
literature reviews in philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on philosophical methodology in general, there is
surprisingly little explicit reflection on the practice of literature review
itself in philosophy. The relationship between survey articles, overview entries
(SEP/IEP), and research monographs as forms of literature engagement is
under-theorized. Additionally, the differences between philosophical and
scientific literature reviews in terms of goals, methods, and epistemology
deserve more systematic attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should highlight how different metaphilosophical positions
yield different conceptions of what literature reviews should accomplish. It
should also trace the recent globalizing turn in metaphilosophy and its
implications for whose work counts as "the literature." Key tensions to explore
include progress vs. history-dependency, unity vs. plurality of method, and
first-order vs. second-order approaches to philosophy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Naturalist metaphilosophy (Williamson): 6 papers - Philosophy continuous with
  science, using similar methods and standards of progress
- Pragmatist metaphilosophy (Rescher): 3 papers - Philosophy evaluated by
  practical consequences and problem-solving effectiveness
- Historical/hermeneutic approaches: 4 papers - Philosophy as historically
  embedded, requiring attention to context and tradition
- Pluralist approaches (Lewin, Denecke): 3 papers - Multiple valid methodologies,
  recognition of diverse philosophical traditions
- Critical/decolonial approaches (Denecke, Utomo): 2 papers - Challenging
  Western hegemony, recognizing non-Western philosophical traditions

DOMAIN: Purpose, Epistemology, and Methodology of Literature Reviews in Philosophy and the Humanities
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 6 total (High: 3, Medium: 3, Low: 0)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, WebSearch
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses a significant gap in the literature: explicit theorizing about what literature reviews are, what they are for, and how they should be conducted in philosophy and the humanities. Unlike the natural and social sciences, which have developed extensive methodological literature on systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and meta-analyses, philosophy and the humanities lack dedicated frameworks for conducting and evaluating literature reviews as a scholarly genre.

The available literature falls into three clusters: (1) methodological frameworks from adjacent fields (health information science, social research) that have been influential but not systematically adapted to humanities contexts; (2) metaphilosophical works that address the nature and methods of philosophy itself, which implicitly bear on how philosophers should survey and synthesize existing work; and (3) emerging discussions of philosophical methodology that occasionally touch on review practices without making them central.

Grant and Booth's typology of review types and Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, though developed for health and social research, have become reference points for humanities scholars seeking structured approaches. However, these frameworks assume empirical research paradigms and evidence-based methodologies that do not straightforwardly translate to philosophical inquiry, which proceeds primarily through conceptual analysis, normative argument, and critical interpretation rather than empirical data collection.

The metaphilosophical literature (Williamson, Thomasson, D'Oro & Overgaard, Cappelen et al.) addresses fundamental questions about philosophical methods but does not explicitly theorize the literature review as a distinct methodological practice. These works establish the contested nature of philosophical methodology itself—whether philosophy is continuous with science, whether it has distinctive methods, what role intuitions and conceptual analysis play—questions that shape but do not determine how philosophers should approach surveying and synthesizing existing literature.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to the research project's attempt to develop a methodology for literature reviews in philosophy. The scarcity of direct literature on this topic is itself a significant finding: it reveals that philosophers have not typically treated literature review as a methodological problem requiring explicit theorization. The project thus enters relatively uncharted territory, with the opportunity to draw selectively from adjacent fields while remaining sensitive to the distinctive features of philosophical inquiry.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
There is almost no literature explicitly addressing the genre of the philosophical literature review, the philosophical survey article, or the state-of-the-art review in philosophy. No works were found that systematically compare review methodologies across disciplines or that develop criteria for evaluating the quality of philosophical literature reviews. The epistemology of literature reviews—how surveying existing work generates new knowledge—remains largely implicit in philosophical practice.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should acknowledge the domain's sparseness and frame this as both a challenge and an opportunity. It should carefully distinguish methodological frameworks developed for empirical research from those potentially applicable to philosophy, and it should extract implicit methodological commitments from metaphilosophical works. The project may need to rely more heavily on inference from practice (how literature reviews actually function in philosophy) than on explicit methodological prescription.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Evidence-based review frameworks (2 papers): Grant & Booth, Arksey & O'Malley - systematic and scoping review methodologies from health/social sciences
- Metaphilosophical positions on philosophical method (4 papers): Williamson, Thomasson, two Companions/Handbooks - diverse views on nature of philosophy and its methods, with implications for how philosophical literature should be surveyed and synthesized

DOMAIN: Citation Ethics, Epistemic Injustice, and Scholarly Inclusion
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the ethics of citation practices through the lens of epistemic injustice. Miranda Fricker's 2007 foundational work identified testimonial and hermeneutical injustice as distinctively epistemic wrongs that harm people in their capacity as knowers. Testimonial injustice occurs when prejudice causes a speaker to receive deflated credibility; hermeneutical injustice arises when marginalized groups lack collective conceptual resources to articulate their experiences. This framework has been extensively applied and critiqued, with Kristie Dotson expanding it to include contributory injustice (when marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to collective hermeneutical resources) and epistemic violence (systematic silencing). Jos\u00e9 Medina's work develops the notion of epistemic resistance and the collective dimensions of epistemic oppression.

The domain specifically addresses how citational practices perpetuate or resist these injustices. Citation functions as a form of testimonial recognition: who gets cited, whose work is rendered invisible, and whose perspectives are marginalized in scholarly knowledge production all reflect and reinforce broader patterns of epistemic injustice. Recent work explores citational justice as a subspecies of testimonial justice, examining how gender, race, geography, and institutional prestige shape citation networks in philosophy. Empirical studies document systematic citation bias, while normative work debates scholars' ethical obligations in citation practices and whether social justice considerations should influence bibliographic selection.

Key debates include: whether citational justice demands demographic representation or substantive engagement with marginalized perspectives; whether "strategic" citation for social justice reasons constitutes ethically bad epistemic practice; how to balance epistemic and ethical considerations in citation; and whether literature reviews themselves can instantiate epistemic injustice through exclusionary citational practices.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the metaphilosophical inquiry into literature review methodology and ethics. Literature reviews are constituted through citational choices—every bibliography embodies decisions about whose testimony to include, amplify, or omit. The epistemic injustice framework illuminates how ostensibly neutral methodological practices (comprehensiveness, relevance criteria, quality standards) can systematically exclude marginalized voices while claiming objectivity. The domain provides conceptual tools to analyze whether and how literature reviews perpetuate testimonial and hermeneutical injustice, and what citational justice would require of reviewers.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical work directly addresses citation ethics in literature reviews specifically (most work focuses on citation generally). Few papers engage with the tension between epistemic rigor and social justice in bibliographic selection. The relationship between citational justice and other forms of epistemic justice (interpretive, hermeneutical) in review contexts remains under-theorized. Five entries (Dotson 2012, Medina 2012, Bruton 2023, Fricker 2010, Taswell 2022) lack abstracts and are marked INCOMPLETE; synthesis agents should prioritize the 13 entries with full abstracts.

Consider Medina's work on epistemic resistance as relevant to counter-practices. Address the nascent discussion of citational justice explicitly. Connect to broader debates about diversity, decolonization, and epistemic pluralism in philosophy. Emphasize that this is an emerging area—many questions remain open.

DOMAIN: Canon Formation, Exclusion, and the Politics of Philosophical Knowledge
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 8, Medium: 5, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines the formation, maintenance, and contestation of the
philosophical canon—the set of texts, authors, and traditions recognized as
"philosophy proper" within academic institutions. The literature reveals that
canon formation is not a neutral process of recognizing intrinsic philosophical
merit, but rather a political and epistemic practice shaped by structures of
power, including racism, sexism, colonialism, and Eurocentrism.

The field is structured around three interconnected debates. First, historical
studies trace how the modern Western canon was actively constructed through
exclusionary practices. Peter K.J. Park's groundbreaking work documents how
19th-century German historians of philosophy systematically excluded African
and Asian thought through explicitly racist arguments. Similarly, feminist
scholars have shown how women philosophers were marginalized through genre
dismissal, lack of institutional access, and historiographical erasure.

Second, decolonial and feminist critiques expose how canon formation perpetuates
"epistemic violence" (Grosfoguel) or "epistemicide" (de Sousa Santos)—the
systematic devaluation and destruction of non-Western and marginalized knowledge
systems. These critiques argue that what presents itself as universal philosophy
is actually the parochial knowledge of a narrow demographic: primarily men from
five Western European countries. The canon thus functions as a mechanism of
exclusion that determines whose voices count as "philosophical."

Third, debates over canon revision reveal tensions between different strategies
for change: "recovery" work that excavates marginalized figures, "critique" that
exposes canonical texts' complicity in oppression, and "abolition" that questions
whether reform is possible. Recent work questions whether adding diverse voices
to existing structures addresses the deeper epistemic frameworks that made
exclusion possible in the first place.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain is directly relevant to the metaphilosophical inquiry into literature
reviews because canon formation fundamentally shapes what counts as "the relevant
literature" for any philosophical inquiry. Literature reviews do not merely
survey a pre-existing field—they participate in reproducing or contesting
canonical boundaries. The mechanisms of canon formation (institutional gatekeeping,
genre hierarchies, citation practices) parallel the mechanisms through which
literature reviews constitute their objects. Understanding how canons emerge
through collective practices of recognition and exclusion illuminates how
literature reviews function as sites of epistemic and political power.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

While the literature extensively documents Western canon formation and its
critiques, there is less work on how canons operate in non-Western philosophical
traditions (though see the Confucian and Islamic philosophy examples). Additionally,
the empirical mechanisms linking canon formation to contemporary literature
review practices remain understudied—most work focuses on historical formation
rather than present-day reproduction. The relationship between digital infrastructure
(databases, search engines) and contemporary canon formation also needs attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the mechanisms and power dynamics of canon formation
rather than simply cataloging excluded figures. Connect historical analyses of
19th-century canon construction to contemporary practices of literature review
and philosophical pedagogy. Highlight tensions between different strategies for
change (recovery, critique, abolition) and their implications for rethinking
literature review methodology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical critique (8 papers): Documents racist, sexist, colonial origins of modern canon
- Decolonial/epistemicide frameworks (5 papers): Theorizes epistemic violence of Western universalism
- Feminist recovery and critique (4 papers): Both excavates excluded women and critiques canonical androcentrism
- Canon revision debates (3 papers): Examines strategies and politics of changing what counts as philosophy

DOMAIN: Hermeneutics, Interpretation, and Charitable Reading
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 12 total (High: 5, Medium: 5, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the philosophical foundations of interpretation and the principle of charity as they relate to scholarly practice, particularly in literature reviews and philosophical engagement with others' work. The field divides into three main streams: (1) Gadamerian hermeneutics emphasizing the horizon-fusion model of understanding texts within tradition, (2) Davidsonian radical interpretation using the principle of charity as a constraint on attributing beliefs and meanings, and (3) contemporary debates about the ethics and politics of charitable reading in academic philosophy. Recent work has problematized the seemingly neutral principle of charity, revealing how it can perpetuate disciplinary hierarchies and epistemic oppression when selectively applied. The domain connects hermeneutic theory (Gadamer, Ricoeur) with analytic philosophy of language (Davidson, Quine) and with feminist and critical approaches questioning who receives charitable interpretation.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational to the research project as it directly addresses methodological questions about how to read, represent, and engage with others' philosophical positions in literature reviews. The principle of charity frames the interpretive obligations scholars have when representing others' views, while hermeneutic theory illuminates the conditions for adequate understanding across historical and conceptual distance. The critical literature on the "charitability gap" raises crucial ethical questions about whose work receives generous interpretation and whose is subjected to uncharitable reading—questions directly relevant to the ethics of literature review methodology.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive literature on the principle of charity in formal semantics and interpretation theory, and growing work on its misuses in academic philosophy, there remains little explicit discussion of how these principles should guide the specific practice of writing literature reviews. The connection between hermeneutic philosophy and the methodological choices made in constructing literature reviews is largely implicit. Additionally, most discussions of charity focus on interpreting individual texts or utterances rather than synthesizing bodies of literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should trace how the principle of charity moves from Davidson's semantic theory to contemporary debates about interpretive practice, and how Gadamerian hermeneutics offers an alternative model emphasizing historical consciousness and prejudices. Key tension: whether charity is a transcendental condition of interpretation (Davidson) or an ethical virtue that can be misapplied (Lockard, Stevens). Consider how these different models would change literature review methodology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Davidsonian Charity (5 papers): Charity as constitutive constraint on interpretation
- Gadamerian Hermeneutics (3 papers): Horizon-fusion and prejudice in understanding
- Critical/Feminist Approaches (2 papers): Charitability gap and selective application
- Virtue Ethics of Interpretation (2 papers): Charity as moral and epistemic virtue

DOMAIN: Sociology of Philosophy, Academic Gatekeeping, and Bibliometrics
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-10
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines how the discipline of philosophy operates as a social and institutional system. The sociology of philosophy studies philosophical knowledge production through the lens of social structures, intellectual networks, and institutional practices. Key contributions come from Carl-Göran Heidegren and Henrik Lundberg, who articulate the field's basic approach as praxeological—treating philosophy as socially situated practices that result in arguments and doctrines. Martin Kusch's foundational case study of psychologism demonstrates how philosophical controversies can be analyzed sociologically.

Bibliometric studies reveal citation patterns and prestige hierarchies within philosophy. Petrovich and colleagues pioneer "mention extraction"—going beyond standard citation analysis to capture how philosophers reference each other in text. These studies show philosophy's relationship to empirical sciences is increasing (Rehren & Armbruster 2025), though philosophy of mind and applied ethics engage more with neuroscience than "core" analytic areas (Petrovich & Viola 2024). Lisciandra (2025) critiques citation metrics from a philosophy of science perspective, arguing they fail to "carve science at its joints" by ignoring field-specific differences. De Bruin (2023) provides both meta-rankings and new survey data on journal prestige.

The peer review system attracts significant scrutiny. Heesen and Bright (2021) argue prepublication peer review should be abolished in favor of postpublication review on epistemic grounds. Katzav and Vaesen examine how stringent peer review affects pluralism. Gender and diversity studies document persistent underrepresentation: Leuschner (2019) identifies women's lower submission rates to journals as an indirect effect of social biases. Laakso and Polonioli (2018) map open access availability in ethics, finding ethicists simultaneously prone to copyright infringement and undersharing. Studies on language bias (Contesi et al.) and canonical gatekeeping (Connell & Janssen-Lauret) show how institutional practices exclude non-Anglophone and women philosophers.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses the social and institutional structures that shape what literature is available to be reviewed. The gatekeeping mechanisms examined here—peer review, journal prestige hierarchies, gender and racial demographics, language bias—determine which voices and arguments enter the philosophical record. For a metaphilosophical inquiry into literature review methodology, understanding these selection pressures is essential: literature reviews do not operate on a neutral body of texts, but on a corpus shaped by institutional power structures. The bibliometric work also models methodologies that could be applied to study literature review practices themselves.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

The field lacks comprehensive empirical studies of how literature reviews in philosophy are actually conducted—what search strategies philosophers use, which sources they privilege, how they determine scope. Most work focuses on article and book publication, not on review articles or synthetic scholarship. The relationship between prestige hierarchies and what gets reviewed (versus merely published) remains underexplored. Non-Anglophone philosophy's bibliometric patterns need more attention beyond language bias studies.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the tension between philosophy's self-image as pursuing timeless truths and the empirical evidence of its operation as a socially structured profession with gatekeeping mechanisms. The work on peer review and gender/diversity connects to the ethics of literature reviews: whose work do we have epistemic obligations to seek out? The bibliometric studies provide methodological models but also cautionary tales about the limits of quantitative approaches in humanities disciplines.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Sociology of philosophy (Heidegren, Lundberg, Kusch): 8 papers - Philosophical knowledge production as socially situated practice
- Bibliometrics and citation analysis (Petrovich, Lisciandra, Rehren): 5 papers - Quantitative methods to map philosophical communities and influence
- Peer review critique (Heesen & Bright, Katzav & Vaesen): 2 papers - Questioning traditional gatekeeping mechanisms

PAPERS_FOUND: 10 total (High: 4, Medium: 4, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the ethical norms and responsibilities governing scholarly
practice in philosophy and the humanities, with particular focus on intellectual
honesty, research integrity, and the ethics of knowledge production. While biomedical
research ethics is well-established, scholarship on research ethics specific to the
humanities remains underdeveloped. Key debates include: What obligations do scholars
have regarding comprehensive literature engagement? How does intellectual honesty
function as an epistemic virtue? What are the ethics of selective citation and
omission in scholarship? Recent work has expanded beyond individual misconduct
(plagiarism, fabrication) to examine structural issues like epistemological racism,
power dynamics in knowledge production, and the responsibilities of scholarly
communication. Christian Miller and T. Ryan Byerly have developed accounts of
intellectual honesty as a virtue, while Ryuko Kubota and others critique how
hegemonic knowledge systems marginalize scholars from the Global South and women of
color. The field increasingly recognizes that research ethics involves not just
following procedural rules but cultivating intellectual virtues and addressing
systemic inequities in knowledge production.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the normative foundations of literature review
methodology. If comprehensive literature engagement is an ethical obligation, what
grounds this duty? The intellectual honesty literature provides virtue-theoretic
frameworks for understanding scholars' responsibilities regarding truth-telling,
citation practices, and acknowledgment of limitations. The epistemological racism
and knowledge production critiques reveal how literature review practices can
perpetuate inequities by privileging certain voices and marginalizing others. This
domain thus provides essential normative resources for evaluating whether selective
literature engagement constitutes ethical scholarship.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers explicitly address the ethics of literature reviews or comprehensive
literature engagement as a specific scholarly practice. Most work focuses on
misconduct (plagiarism) or broad issues in knowledge production. There is limited
philosophical analysis of what makes citation practices ethically justified or how
intellectual honesty applies specifically to literature synthesis. The connection
between intellectual virtues and concrete research practices remains undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should connect virtue epistemology (intellectual honesty, transparency)
with structural critiques of knowledge production (epistemological racism, power
dynamics). Consider how individual-level virtues and systemic-level critiques
complement or tension with each other. Explore whether intellectual honesty provides
sufficient normative resources for evaluating literature review practices or whether
additional principles (justice, care, solidarity) are needed.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Virtue-theoretic approaches: 5 papers - Intellectual honesty/transparency as
  epistemic virtues (Guenin, Miller, Byerly, King, Baehr)
- Structural/critical approaches: 3 papers - Epistemological racism and power in
  knowledge production (Kubota, Burrell et al., Luchies)
- Research integrity frameworks: 2 papers - Scholarly record correction and academic
  integrity (Dougherty, Khamitov)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Philosophy is not fundamentally different from science in its methodology or epistemic status. Philosophical questions can be addressed through ordinary reasoning, observation, and theoretical inference, without appeal to special philosophical intuitions or a priori knowledge. Williamson defends a naturalistic conception of philosophy against approaches that treat it as conceptual analysis, linguistic investigation, or fundamentally distinct from empirical inquiry. He argues that philosophy makes progress through the accumulation of knowledge, similar to sciences, and that metaphilosophical reflection should itself be conducted as first-order philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This work establishes the most influential contemporary defense of naturalistic metaphilosophy. For understanding literature reviews in philosophy, Williamson's view implies that philosophical literature functions similarly to scientific literature: as a cumulative body of knowledge where later work builds on earlier results. His rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction and defense of philosophical progress has direct implications for how we conceive the relationship between a philosophical argument and the existing literature. If philosophy is continuous with science, then philosophical literature reviews should adopt similar methodological standards to scientific reviews.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive handbook surveys the diverse methodologies employed in contemporary philosophy, including conceptual analysis, thought experiments, formal methods, experimental philosophy, and phenomenological approaches. The volume's editors and contributors collectively argue that philosophical methodology is heterogeneous, with different methods appropriate for different philosophical questions. The handbook covers both traditional methods (e.g., analysis, intuitions) and newer approaches (e.g., experimental philosophy, formal epistemology), showing both continuities and tensions between them.

  RELEVANCE: This handbook provides the most comprehensive recent survey of philosophical methods, making it essential for understanding the methodological landscape within which philosophical literature reviews operate. The diverse methods discussed (experimental, formal, phenomenological, conceptual) each imply different relationships to existing literature. For instance, experimental philosophy's empirical methods suggest a different role for literature than purely conceptual analysis. The handbook's pluralism about method directly informs questions about whether there can be a unified methodology for philosophical literature reviews or whether different subfields require different approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This companion volume explores philosophical methodology from both analytic and continental perspectives, arguing that the divide between these traditions reflects different metaphilosophical commitments rather than simply different topics or styles. The volume emphasizes that methodological choices in philosophy are theory-laden and depend on prior commitments about the nature of philosophy itself. Contributors examine methods including phenomenology, hermeneutics, conceptual analysis, ordinary language philosophy, and naturalized epistemology, showing how each method embodies different assumptions about philosophical knowledge.

  RELEVANCE: Unlike the Oxford Handbook's survey approach, this volume explicitly thematizes the relationship between methodology and metaphilosophy, making it particularly relevant for understanding how different conceptions of philosophy yield different approaches to literature. The inclusion of both analytic and continental perspectives is crucial for a project examining literature reviews across philosophical traditions, as it highlights that what counts as "the relevant literature" depends on one's methodological orientation. The volume's attention to the theory-ladenness of method suggests that literature reviews cannot be methodologically neutral.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewin provides a systematic reconstruction of Kant's metaphilosophy, arguing that Kant developed an explicit account of philosophy's nature, aims, and methods. Kant distinguishes between philosophy as activity and philosophy as system, between the worldly concept and the scholastic concept of philosophy, and between philosophy as proper science and philosophy as idea. Lewin argues that Kant's critical project is fundamentally metaphilosophical: it investigates the conditions under which philosophy can be scientific. This analysis reveals eight elements of an "imperfect definition" of philosophy in Kant's work, including philosophy as an architectonic idea and reason as the absolute condition of philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that metaphilosophical reflection has a distinguished historical pedigree and that Kant's critical philosophy centrally concerns the methodology of philosophy itself. For understanding literature reviews in philosophy, Kant's distinction between philosophy as activity and as system suggests that engaging with literature is not merely about surveying existing results but about participating in a distinctive form of rational activity. Kant's emphasis on systematic unity and architectonic structure implies that philosophical literature cannot be treated as a mere aggregation of results but must be understood in light of how individual contributions relate to systematic wholes.

In the second part, I will analyze eight elements for an “imperfect definition” (KrV A731/B759) of philosophy outlining the scope of Kant’s explicit metaphilosophy against the backdrop of recent metaphilosophical research: (i) scientific concept of philosophy, (ii) philosophy as an activity, (iii) worldly concept, (iv) philosophy as a (proper and improper) science, (v) philosophy as an architectonic idea (archetype and ectypes), (vi) philosophy as a social practice and the appropriate holding-to-be-true (one or many true philosophies?), (vii) reason as the absolute condition and subject of philosophy, and (viii) methodology of philosophy. I will put these elements together for an attempt to give an imperfect definition of philosophy – something that Kant promised but never did – in the conclusion.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Denecke analyzes the current deadlock in efforts to globalize academic philosophy, identifying four problematic diversity paradigms ("The Same," "The Subaltern," "The Samaritan," and "The Area Studies Silo") that Western-style philosophers find either threatening or uninteresting. She argues that progress requires deep metaphilosophical reflection on what counts as philosophy across world history. By taking a "deeper historical and philological breath" to redraw where philosophy has thrived globally, we can develop a cosmopolitan future for academic philosophy that brings diverse philosophical practices to bear on contemporary global challenges.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the politics and ethics of what counts as "the philosophical literature" in an era of globalization. It argues that current approaches to diversity in philosophy fail because they operate within Western metaphilosophical assumptions about what philosophy is. For a project on literature reviews in philosophy, Denecke's analysis implies that the very question "what is the relevant literature?" cannot be answered without confronting the hegemony of Western philosophical canons and methods. Her call for metaphilosophical reflection as a prerequisite for genuine globalization suggests that literature review methodologies must themselves be reconceived to recognize diverse philosophical traditions.

  POSITION: Critical global philosophy, arguing for metaphilosophical reconstruction to enable genuine philosophical pluralism.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book (reviewed in the article) develops a systematic account of philosophical methodology structured around five questions: What is the structure of theoretical inquiry? What are the goals of philosophical inquiry? What are philosophical data? What is a sound method for philosophical theorizing? Has philosophical progress been made? The authors defend an epistemic theory of philosophical data (data are what inquirers collectively have good epistemic reason to believe) and propose the "Tri-Level Method" as a framework for philosophical theorizing that can facilitate understanding and explain philosophical progress.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides one of the most systematic recent attempts to articulate a unified philosophical methodology. The emphasis on philosophical data and the collective epistemic standing of the discipline is directly relevant to understanding how literature functions in philosophical inquiry: past philosophical work contributes to the collective body of data and reasons that constrain current theorizing. The defense of philosophical progress and the Tri-Level Method suggest that literature reviews in philosophy should track not just the history of positions but the accumulation of reasons and the refinement of theories over time.

  doi = {10.1111/meta.12553},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This introduction to a special issue on metaphilosophy argues that recent years have seen increasing interest in metaphilosophical questions, driven by new approaches and methods in philosophy (digital philosophy of science, conceptual engineering, practice-based approaches to logic). The article identifies key metaphilosophical issues including philosophical progress, the aims of philosophy, naturalism, ordinary language philosophy, and the relationship between philosophical methods and their objects of study. It argues that examining philosophy's own methods and assumptions is essential to responsible philosophical practice.

  RELEVANCE: This recent overview of metaphilosophical debates provides a snapshot of contemporary concerns and new directions in the field. The emphasis on examining philosophy's own methods before doing philosophy connects directly to the project of understanding literature reviews: engaging with literature is itself a philosophical practice that requires methodological reflection. The mention of new methods (digital philosophy, conceptual engineering) suggests that technological and social changes may require rethinking traditional approaches to philosophical literature.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewin argues that both Kant's conception of philosophy and contemporary metaphilosophy deserve systematic attention and mutual illumination. Kant's direct analyses of philosophy's nature, aims, and methods address issues that constitute the research field of contemporary metaphilosophy: the taxonomy of philosophy, the relation between empirical and non-empirical philosophy, the relation between philosophy and its history, conceptual analysis, deductive reasoning, and philosophical disagreement. The article introduces debates about Kant's metaphilosophical value and argues for the continuing relevance of historical metaphilosophy to contemporary discussions.

  RELEVANCE: This introduction establishes historical continuity in metaphilosophical inquiry, showing that reflection on philosophical method is not a recent innovation but has deep roots in the canonical tradition. For understanding literature reviews, the emphasis on "the relation between philosophy and its history" is particularly significant: it suggests that engaging with the literature is not external to philosophical inquiry but integral to it. The attention to philosophical disagreement also connects to questions about how literature reviews should handle persistent philosophical controversies.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.21146/2072-0726-2023-16-3-55-68},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using case studies of the analytical, linguistic, pragmatic, and ontological turns in 20th-century philosophy, Skripnik argues that philosophical "turns" are fundamentally changes in research methods that lead to new problem areas and subject matters. The analytical turn involved diversification of analysis methods; the linguistic turn changed methods of philosophical analysis, generating new problems in both philosophy and linguistics; the pragmatic turn used pragmatist methods to bridge analytic and continental philosophy; and the ontological turn shifted methods toward seeing things "as they really are" beyond multiculturalism to multi-naturalism.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of philosophical turns as methodological shifts has direct implications for understanding how philosophical literature evolves. It suggests that the relevant literature for a philosophical question changes not just through new arguments on the same topic, but through methodological innovations that reframe what counts as relevant. For literature review methodology, this implies that reviews must be sensitive to how different methodological paradigms constitute different bodies of "relevant" literature, and how methodological turns can make previously separate literatures suddenly relevant to each other.

  abstract = {The purpose of the article is to consider the phenomenon of philosophical “turn” in the framework of descriptive metaphilosophy. Using the example of analytical, linguis­tic, pragmatic and ontological turns, an attempt is made to highlight the characteristic fea­tures of “turns”. The author shows that the analytical turn is associated with the develop­ment of methods of philosophy, primarily with the diversification of the concept of analy­sis itself. Consideration of the linguistic turn leads to the position that its characterization as a change in the subject of philosophy is not quite adequate – in fact, it is a change in the methods of philosophical analysis, which leads to the emergence of new problem areas not only in philosophy, but also in linguistics. The pragmatic turn is characterized by emphasizing the role of pragmatism in overcoming the existing opposition of analytic and continental philosophy through the use of both logical and, for example, axiological methods or the “pragmatic principle”. The ontological turn, characteristic of anthropol­ogy, the philosophy of technology, as well as for “general” philosophy, is associated with a change in the methods of analysis in the direction of solving the problem of seeing “things in a new way” and how “they really are”. The analysis in the case of an ontologi­cal turn is aimed not so much at “multiculturalism” as at “multi-naturalism”, at taking into account the active role of the subject and building the research models capable of taking this into account. The final position of the author is that according to which a “turn” is a change in research methods that leads to the formation of a new subject area and the formulation of new problems.

  CORE ARGUMENT: In this wide-ranging interview, Groff discusses her intellectual development as a realist philosopher, her role as a community organizer in philosophy, and her relationship to critical realism. She addresses the nature and legacy of positivism, the concept of falsehood, realism about causal powers, mind-independent reality, the history of philosophy, and the role of ideology-critique in philosophical inquiry. Groff argues that philosophical inquiry is never ideologically neutral and that examining the social and political dimensions of philosophical positions is itself a form of philosophical work.

  RELEVANCE: This interview articulates a critical realist metaphilosophy that emphasizes philosophy's political dimensions and its role in ideology-critique. For literature review methodology, this perspective suggests that reviewing existing literature is not a neutral scholarly exercise but involves political and ethical decisions about which voices to center, which problems to take seriously, and which forms of knowledge to recognize. The emphasis on positivism's legacy also highlights how past methodological commitments continue to shape what counts as legitimate philosophical work and thus what enters the literature.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Clarke-Doane examines the problem of mathematical knowledge and its implications for metaphilosophy. He argues that the challenge to explain mathematical knowledge arises from disagreement over mathematical axioms that bottoms out in disagreement over intuitions (the justificatory challenge) and from the modal fact that we could easily have had different mathematical beliefs (the reliability challenge). He argues that mathematical facts might be so plentiful that our knowledge of them is unmysterious, and extends this pluralism to modality, logic, and normative theory. This metaphilosophical pluralism has surprising implications: metaphysically it engenders perspectivalism and indeterminacy, while methodologically it vindicates Carnapian pragmatism.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on mathematics, this work has direct implications for philosophical methodology more broadly. The argument that philosophical disagreements often bottom out in disagreements over intuitions connects to debates about the role of intuitions in philosophical method. The defense of pluralism across multiple domains (mathematics, modality, logic, normative theory) suggests that philosophical literature will exhibit deep disagreements that cannot be resolved by appeal to shared data or methods. For literature review methodology, this implies that reviews cannot aim for convergence on truth but must acknowledge legitimate pluralism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Nado addresses how to think about debates in philosophical methodology, particularly in light of challenges from experimental philosophy. She argues that metaphilosophical debates should not be understood as purely empirical questions about how philosophers actually reason, nor as purely normative questions about how philosophers should reason in isolation from actual practice. Instead, methodological debates involve both descriptive and normative elements in complex interaction. Understanding actual philosophical practice is necessary for evaluating proposed methodologies, but empirical findings alone cannot settle methodological questions.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses the methodology of metaphilosophy itself, providing a framework for thinking about methodological debates. For literature review methodology, it suggests that prescriptive methodologies for conducting reviews cannot be developed independently of examining how philosophical literature reviews actually function in practice. At the same time, descriptive accounts of existing review practices do not automatically vindicate those practices. This implies that developing a methodology for philosophical literature reviews requires both empirical investigation of actual practices and normative reflection on their justification.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schmid examines how Kant, Salomon Maimon, and F.W.J. Schelling developed distinctive methods for philosophizing about philosophy itself. The book argues that these German Idealist philosophers recognized that metaphilosophy requires distinctive methods because of its special object: philosophy itself. The investigation proceeds by examining how these thinkers engaged with 18th-century scientific theories and practices, showing that philosophical experiments, fictions, and models offer methodological solutions to the problem of developing a scientific metaphysics. The book demonstrates that metaphilosophical reflection has a sophisticated methodological history.

  RELEVANCE: This historical study shows that the problem of how to conduct metaphilosophical inquiry (including inquiry into philosophical methods) has a rich intellectual tradition. For literature review methodology, it suggests that reflecting on how to review philosophical literature is itself a metaphilosophical question requiring appropriate methods. The emphasis on how German Idealists drew on scientific practices of their era to develop philosophical methods suggests that contemporary literature review methodologies might similarly benefit from engaging with current scholarly practices in adjacent fields while maintaining awareness of philosophy's distinctive character.

What unites their projects is the thesis that philosophy must begin with an investigation of its own nature, and that this investigation, because of its special object, must be accompanied by a reflection on its method. To this end, their methods are discussed on the assumption that these methods arise from a particular engagement with the theories and practices of the 18th century sciences.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reinoso argues against the interpretation of Neopyrrhonism (linking Wittgenstein and ancient Pyrrhonian skepticism) as a quietist metaphilosophy that cancels philosophy through self-destructive arguments. Instead, she proposes interpreting Neopyrrhonism as a performative metaphilosophy that is an open-ended inquiry using different philosophical argumentative strategies to encourage new ways of practicing philosophy. This non-quietist Neopyrrhonism involves skepticism about philosophy based on philosophical arguments, but does not conclude that philosophy should cease; rather, it transforms how philosophy is done.

  RELEVANCE: This article offers an alternative metaphilosophical position that is skeptical about traditional philosophical methods while remaining engaged in philosophical inquiry. For literature review methodology, a Neopyrrhonist approach would emphasize examining the arguments and presuppositions in the literature rather than accepting them, using the literature performatively to generate new philosophical questions. This contrasts with approaches that treat the literature as a body of established results to build upon. The distinction between quietist and non-quietist metaphilosophy also maps onto different possible attitudes toward philosophical literature: accepting its authority vs. subjecting it to ongoing critical scrutiny.

  abstract = {Fogelin (2002 [1976]; 1992 [1981]; 1994) was the first one to speak about “Neopyrrhonism” to link Wittgenstein and Sextus Empiricus. To him, Pyrrhonism “combines philosophical scepticism with scepticism about philosophy, that is, to have doubts about philosophy on the basis of philosophical arguments” (1994, p. 3). Following this interpretation, Neopyrrhonism can be understood as a kind of scepticism that cancels philosophy using self-destructive arguments (peritrope). Both Sextus -with his proposal of suspension of judgment- and Wittgenstein -with his idea of the dissolution of philosophical problems- are representatives of quietism. Neopyrrhonism as quietism can be conceived of as a therapeutic proposal mainly based on not postulating an argumentative-constructive philosophical theory. Against this perspective, I propose interpreting Neopyrrhonism as Metaphilosophy, from which a performative proposal emerges. In this approach, Neopyrrhonism is an open-ended inquiry that implies the ability of using different philosophical argumentative strategies in a performative sense to encourage a new way of exercising philosophy. },

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Yetman argues that Conceptual Metaphor Theory's (CMT) critique of philosophy—that philosophical concepts and arguments rely on unacknowledged metaphorical structures that can lead philosophy astray—was anticipated by Wittgenstein and his student Margaret MacDonald. Wittgenstein's method of identifying and resolving philosophical puzzles generated by misused grammatical analogies, and MacDonald's analysis of how and why such analogies create problems, both prefigure CMT's claims about metaphor in philosophy. Yetman supplements these historical figures' diagnoses with evidence from CMT showing that linguistic metaphors often originate in deeper cognitive mappings.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses how metaphors and analogies function in philosophical reasoning, with implications for how we read philosophical literature. If philosophical arguments often rely on implicit metaphorical structures, then understanding a piece of philosophical literature requires identifying these structures. For literature review methodology, this suggests that reviews should attend not just to explicit arguments but to the metaphors and analogies that structure philosophical discourse. It also implies that different philosophical traditions may employ different root metaphors, making cross-traditional literature reviews particularly challenging.

One brand of external critique is associated with Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), the view that human cognition is partially structured by pervasive and automatic mappings between conceptual domains. Most notably, Lakoff and Johnson (1999) claimed that many central philosophical concepts and arguments rely on an unacknowledged metaphorical substructure, and that this structure has sometimes led philosophy astray. The purpose of this paper is to argue that Lakoff and Johnson's critique is anticipated by the work of post‐Tractarian Wittgenstein and his student, Margaret MacDonald. In the Blue Book, Wittgenstein outlines a method for identifying and resolving philosophical puzzles generated by misused grammatical analogies, although his discussion lacks a precise characterization of exactly how and why such analogies lead to trouble. In a 1938 paper, MacDonald offers such a characterization, which I outline and then connect back to Wittgenstein. In addition to this interpretive work, I supplement Wittgenstein and MacDonald's diagnosis using evidence from CMT which suggests that linguistic metaphors and analogies often originate in or are motivated by more fundamental analogical mappings in cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pati examines what it means to speak of a "Hegelian metaphilosophy" and assesses Hegel's relevance for contemporary metaphilosophical debates. He argues that Hegel developed a distinctive conception of philosophy as the self-conscious comprehension of its own historical development, where philosophy is both historically situated and capable of grasping its own historicity. This Hegelian metaphilosophy offers resources for contemporary debates about philosophical progress, the relationship between philosophy and its history, and the possibility of overcoming philosophical disagreements through dialectical development.

  RELEVANCE: Hegel's metaphilosophy offers a distinctive account of how philosophical inquiry relates to its own history—neither treating the history of philosophy as mere preparatory material (as in cumulative progress models) nor as historically relative with no trans-historical standards (as in radical historicism). For literature review methodology, a Hegelian approach would emphasize understanding how current philosophical questions emerge from the internal development of past philosophical positions, requiring literature reviews to reconstruct this dialectical development rather than simply cataloging positions. This contrasts with both naturalistic and purely historical approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This article critically examines how Western philosophy constructs epistemic hegemony through historical narratives (linear progress from Greece to modernity), methodological standards (logical-deductive methods as prerequisites for philosophical validity), and terminology (Greek-Latin vocabulary as necessary for philosophical discourse). These mechanisms systematically exclude non-Western thought (exemplified by Confucianism and Daoism) from recognition as philosophy. The authors propose "dialogical exclusive multiplicity" as an alternative framework that recognizes non-Western traditions as autonomous and equal rather than requiring them to conform to Western philosophical categories.

  RELEVANCE: This article directly addresses power dynamics in defining what counts as philosophy and thus what counts as philosophical literature. For literature review methodology, it exposes how seemingly neutral methodological choices (what sources to include, what languages to prioritize, what standards of argument to apply) can reproduce epistemic hegemony. The proposal for "dialogical exclusive multiplicity" suggests that philosophical literature reviews should not force non-Western traditions into Western frameworks but should recognize multiple autonomous philosophical traditions, each with their own internal standards and development.

This research is significant as the discourse of global philosophy remains dominated by Western epistemic structures that limit the plurality of rational forms. Employing a qualitative, literature-based approach, this study analyzes key metaphilosophical texts, Jacques Derrida’s theory of deconstruction, and Alain Badiou’s ontology as conceptual tools to trace power relations embedded in the definitions and boundaries of philosophy. The findings reveal that Western philosophy has institutionalized a linear historical narrative, logical-deductive methodological standards, and a Greek-Latin vocabulary as prerequisites for philosophical validity—resulting in the systematic exclusion of non-Western thought. The study further proposes a conceptual framework of dialogical exclusive multiplicity as an alternative for recognizing truth procedures in non-Western traditions as autonomous and equal. The implications of this research open avenues for deconstructing philosophy as the sole legitimate mode of thinking and promote the formation of a more epistemically just global philosophical ecosystem. The originality of this study lies in its critical synthesis of metaphilosophy, deconstruction, and contemporary ontology to construct an alternative paradigm for cross-traditional philosophical inquiry—one based not on inclusion, but on recognition and articulative equality.

This challenges interpretations that see Kant as exclusively concerned with pure philosophical inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between pure and impure philosophy raises questions about what kinds of considerations belong in philosophical inquiry and thus what literature is relevant. If philosophy properly includes empirical elements (impure philosophy), then philosophical literature reviews might need to engage with empirical research more extensively than if philosophy is purely a priori. For understanding philosophical methodology, Garcia's analysis suggests that different areas of philosophy may have different relationships to empirical inquiry and thus different methodologies for engaging with literature.

  POSITION: Kantian metaphilosophy emphasizing the complementary roles of pure and impure philosophical inquiry.

This paper focuses on the third project. In particular, it explores one of the most intriguing yet puzzling aspects of Kant’s philosophy, viz. the relationship between what Kant calls ‘pure’ philosophy vs. ‘applied’, ‘empirical’ or what we can broadly refer to as ‘impure’ philosophy. (As we shall see, in order to be able to address this third project, we shall also need to examine the other two projects in detail.) My plan is as follows. First, I discuss four main areas of pure vs. impure philosophy: (i) ‘pure logic’ vs. ‘applied logic’; (ii) ‘rational psychology’ vs. ‘empirical psychology’; (iii) ‘pure metaphysics of nature’ vs. ‘physics’ and (iv) ‘pure morality’ or a ‘metaphysics of morals’ vs. ‘moral anthropology’, ‘practical anthropology’ or ‘applied moral philosophy’. Based on this, I identify four key differences between pure and impure philosophy. Second, I critically examine four different readings of Kant’s views about the status of ‘impure’ philosophy: (a) that it is not genuine philosophy; (b) that it is bad or inferior philosophy; (c) that it is instrumentally valuable; and (d) that it constitutes an indispensable part of Kant’s philosophy, both in a theoretical and practical sense. I argue that Kant is best interpreted as endorsing readings (c) and (d). Third, I offer some concluding remarks.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Grant and Booth provide a systematic typology of 14 distinct review types (including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-analyses, critical reviews, and literature reviews) and analyze their associated methodologies using the SALSA framework (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis, and Analysis). They clarify the defining characteristics, purposes, and methodological requirements of each review type, addressing widespread confusion about review terminology and methodology.

  RELEVANCE: Though developed for health information science, this typology has become a foundational reference across disciplines seeking structured approaches to literature synthesis. For the present project, it provides a baseline taxonomy of review types against which to assess whether and how these categories apply to philosophical inquiry. The SALSA framework offers a potential starting point for analyzing philosophical review methodology, though the paper's assumption of evidence-based empirical research raises questions about translation to conceptual and normative domains.

  POSITION: Evidence-based research synthesis. Assumes reviews aim to synthesize empirical evidence according to explicit, replicable protocols. Emphasizes transparency, systematic search strategies, and quality appraisal of primary studies—features that may or may not straightforwardly apply to philosophical literature reviews.

  abstract = {Abstract Background and objectives: The expansion of evidence‐based practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Arksey and O'Malley propose a six-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results; and (6) consultation with stakeholders. They distinguish scoping reviews from systematic reviews, emphasizing that scoping studies aim to map key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in a research area rather than to answer narrow research questions through synthesis of empirical evidence.

  RELEVANCE: The scoping review framework is highly relevant to philosophical literature review methodology because scoping reviews' broader, exploratory aims—mapping a field, identifying gaps, clarifying concepts—align more closely with typical aims of philosophical surveys than do the narrowly focused questions of systematic reviews. This paper provides a structured methodology that may translate more readily to philosophy than systematic review protocols, though questions remain about how "evidence" should be understood in philosophical contexts.

  POSITION: Flexible evidence mapping approach. Distinguishes scoping reviews as exploratory and concept-mapping exercises rather than hypothesis-testing syntheses. Emphasizes breadth over depth and allows for iterative refinement of research questions—features that may suit philosophical inquiry's conceptual and argumentative character.

We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Williamson argues against dominant 20th-century views that would reduce philosophy to linguistic analysis, conceptual analysis, or culturally relative inquiry. He defends a robustly realist conception of philosophy as continuous with other forms of inquiry, particularly with science, employing a broadly abductive methodology that seeks the best explanations of all the evidence (including evidence from thought experiments, intuitions, and reflection). Philosophy, on this view, aims at knowledge of objective, mind-independent reality, and philosophical method is not fundamentally distinct from scientific method.

  RELEVANCE: Williamson's defense of philosophical methodology has significant implications for how literature reviews in philosophy should be conceived. If philosophy is continuous with science and employs broadly abductive methods, then literature reviews might function similarly to reviews in empirical sciences—surveying evidence, assessing competing explanatory theories, identifying unsolved problems. However, if philosophical "evidence" includes intuitions, conceptual considerations, and thought experiments, the criteria for appraising and synthesizing this evidence will differ from empirical research, raising questions about what a "systematic" philosophical review would involve.

  POSITION: Methodological continuity between philosophy and science. Rejects linguistic turn and defends philosophy as knowledge-seeking enterprise with methods continuous with (though not identical to) scientific inquiry. Implies literature reviews should survey philosophical "evidence" and assess competing theories, though details of how this works remain to be specified.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Thomasson defends "easy ontology," arguing that many traditional metaphysical disputes about what exists (numbers, properties, social objects, etc.) can be resolved through straightforward conceptual and empirical inferences rather than through deep metaphysical theorizing. Ontological questions are "easy" when they can be answered by combining semantic competence with relevant empirical information. This approach deflates many metaphysical debates, suggesting that philosophers have often mistaken conceptual or semantic questions for substantive questions about the world's fundamental structure.

  RELEVANCE: Though not explicitly about review methodology, Thomasson's easy ontology has significant implications for how philosophical literature should be surveyed and assessed. If many philosophical debates rest on conceptual confusions or category mistakes rather than genuine disagreements about reality, then literature reviews must include a diagnostic component—identifying which debates are substantive and which rest on pseudo-questions. This affects how gaps in the literature are understood: an apparent gap may reflect not an unsolved problem but a dissolved pseudo-problem. Thomasson's work exemplifies a methodological orientation (neo-Carnapian deflationism) that would shape literature review practices differently than, say, naturalistic metaphysics.

  POSITION: Deflationary/easy ontology. Rejects the idea that ontology involves discovering the deep structure of reality in favor of view that ontological questions are typically answerable through conceptual analysis plus empirical input. Implies that literature reviews in metaphysics should identify which debates are substantive versus merely verbal or conceptual.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the concept of epistemic injustice, identifying two forms: testimonial injustice (when identity prejudice causes deflated credibility judgments) and hermeneutical injustice (when gaps in collective interpretive resources disadvantage marginalized groups in understanding their experiences). Argues these wrongs are distinctively epistemic—harming people specifically in their capacity as knowers—and proposes testimonial justice as an epistemic virtue to counteract them.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational work establishing the framework used throughout this domain. Directly relevant to literature review ethics because citational practices involve credibility judgments about whose testimony (scholarship) deserves inclusion and attention. The testimonial injustice concept illuminates how prejudice-driven exclusion from bibliographies wrongs authors as epistemic agents. The hermeneutical dimension addresses how marginalized perspectives may lack recognition as legitimate knowledge contributions.

  POSITION: Virtue epistemology approach emphasizing individual epistemic virtues as corrective. Positions epistemic injustice as simultaneously ethical and epistemic wrong, requiring reflexive critical awareness from hearers/citers.

  abstract = {Abstract Justice is one of the oldest and most central themes of philosophy, but sometimes we would do well to focus instead on injustice. In epistemology, the very idea that there is a first-order ethical dimension to our epistemic practices — the idea that there is such a thing as epistemic justice — remains obscure until we adjust the philosophical lens so that we see through to the negative space that is epistemic injustice. This book argues that there is a distinctively epistemic genus of injustice, in which someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower, wronged therefore in a capacity essential to human value. The book identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. In doing so, it charts the ethical dimension of two fundamental epistemic practices: gaining knowledge by being told and making sense of our social experiences. As the account unfolds, the book travels through a range of philosophical problems. Thus, the book finds an analysis of social power; an account of prejudicial stereotypes; a characterization of two hybrid intellectual-ethical virtues; a revised account of the State of Nature used in genealogical explanations of the concept of knowledge; a discussion of objectification and ‘silencing’; and a framework for a virtue epistemological account of testimony. The book reveals epistemic injustice as a potent yet largely silent dimension of discrimination, analyses the wrong it perpetrates, and constructs two hybrid ethical-intellectual virtues of epistemic justice which aim to forestall it.},

Emphasizes that epistemic oppression operates at group level through "irreducibly reliable" patterns that cannot be addressed through individual virtue alone.

  RELEVANCE: Expands Fricker's framework to emphasize structural dimensions directly relevant to understanding how literature review practices systematically exclude marginalized scholarship. The concept of contributory injustice (preventing marginalized knowers from contributing to collective epistemic resources) directly applies to citational gatekeeping.

  abstract = {AbstractEpistemic oppression refers to persistent epistemic exclusion that hinders one’s contribution to knowledge production. The tendency to shy away from using the term “epistemic oppression” may follow from an assumption that epistemic forms of oppression are generally reducible to social and political forms of oppression. While I agree that many exclusions that compromise one’s ability to contribute to the production of knowledge can be reducible to social and political forms of oppression, there still exists distinctly irreducible forms of epistemic oppression. In this paper, I claim that a major point of distinction between reducible and irreducible epistemic oppression is the major source of difficulty one faces in addressing each kind of oppression, i.e. epistemic power or features of epistemological systems. Distinguishing between reducible and irreducible forms of epistemic oppression can offer a better understanding of what is at stake in deploying the term and when such deployment is apt.Keywords: Epistemic OppressionEpistemic ExclusionEpistemological ResilienceEpistemic PowerEpistemological Systems Notes[1] This definition of epistemic exclusion relies heavily on Irene Omolola’s use of the term (see Adadevoh 2011).[2] My definition of epistemic agency is heavily influenced by Cynthia Townley’s definition (see Townley 2003, 109–110).[3] I use Plato’s Allegory very deliberately here. The allegorical imagery of Plato’s Allegory facilitates an acknowledgement of the three features of our epistemic landscape, that is, situatedness, interdependence and resilience, which I will use to illustrate different epistemic exclusions. It also serves the goals of this paper. I am not concerned here with establishing new forms of epistemic oppression or that epistemic oppression exists. If I held these goals, then utilizing the imagery in Plato’s Allegory would be inappropriate. Rather, my objective is to highlight the possibility of pulling apart reducible and irreducible epistemic oppression. As such, I do not use “real life” examples mainly because my focus is not to demonstrate the actual existence of epistemic oppression itself. Rather, mine is a pursuit of an adequate conceptualization of epistemic oppression. For articles that highlight the existence of epistemic oppression (see Code 1995; Collins 1989; Fricker 1998, 2007; Harding 1986; Langton 2000; Mills 1999). Hence, this analysis is an inquiry into conceptual approaches that can illuminate the existence of epistemic oppression and not an attempt to locate epistemic oppression on the ground.[4] This is not to say all organizational schemata are intentionally decided upon. To say that organizational schemata are intentionally collective is to gesture to the fact that collectives can and do come together according to shared aims, values and/or beliefs for the sake of furthering those aims, values, and/or beliefs. Organizational schemata will, then, develop both inside and outside of these goals thereby creating increasingly complex social-collective schemata.[5] There may be some pause over the focus on effectiveness in this approach to organizational change. However, epistemic affairs, as I understand them, are a normative affairs. Knowing well (internal justification) and accurately (external justification) is often the goal of epistemological investigations. I take this to be a kind of effectiveness.[6] It is important to note, again, that I am not borrowing the insight Plato draws from his Allegory. Rather I am appropriating the imagery for the sake of my attempt to conceptualize epistemic oppression. Hence, my use of the Allegory may diverge starkly from Plato’s positions.[7] Epistemic exclusion is not synonymous with epistemic oppression. Recall, I defined epistemic oppression according to persisting exclusion. Hence, establishing the existence of an epistemic exclusion is only one aspect of establishing the presence of epistemic oppression. One must also demonstrate the persistence of the exclusion.[8] Some would argue that even this kind of search would most likely prove ineffective. For example, Mariana Ortega carefully details how the search for the kinds of experiences that lead to epistemic friction can often lead to “being knowingly, lovingly ignorant,” another recalcitrant form of ignorance (Ortega 2006).[9] To be clear, though Plato would go on to postulate an “outside” of the cave, where access to things-in-themselves resides. I am in no way committed to the idea that there is an outside of the allegorical cave setting Plato creates. In fact, it may well be the case that, as many suggest, there is no outside of our social worlds, where knowledge lies. Regardless of how one resolves the question of knowledge and perspective, there is, however, an outside to one’s own perspective that is often held by other knowers. Hence, the “outside,” in the allegory I am building, points to epistemically different perspectives, that is, mobile vs. fettered persons.[10] This extension of the Allegory is heavily influenced by Nancy Tuana’s articulation of the creation of “epistemically damaged identities,” Patricia Hill Collins’ analysis of the suppression of black feminist thought and Miranda Fricker’s paradigm case of testimonial injustice (see Collins 1989; Fricker 2007; Tuana 2006).[11] I use the phrase “default credibility level” because it does not denote an automatic credibility conferral, but rather a general propensity to give positive credibility assessments.[12] For an account that develops this well, see Medina 2011. Tuana cites the lower credibility given to victims of incest as an example of the “construction of an epistemically disadvantaged identity.” She explains: “Victims of incest are often judged as not being epistemically credible because they are constructed as being suggestible, gullible, or vengeful. Their testimony is discredited; their memories are questioned. In instances such as these, it is not simply facts, events, practices, or technologies that are rendered not known, but individuals and groups who are rendered ‘not knowers.’ They are constructed as untrustworthy.” (2006, 13). In cases where entire groups suffer prejudices that compromise their ability to appear credible, for example, these groups experience epistemic exclusion insofar as their ability to participate in knowledge production is compromised. Their language skills become moot. Their ability to access shared images and metaphors for communicating their experience is lessened considerably. In other words, populations with epistemically disadvantaged identities have a reduced ability to utilize persuasively shared epistemic resources.[13] Miranda Fricker, in her book, Epistemic Injustice, calls the routine deflation of a given groups credibility, testimonial injustice. She writes, testimonial injustice “occurs when prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker’s word” (Fricker 2007, 1). Fricker’s epistemic injustice is a species of epistemic oppression. Insofar as testimonial injustice involves persistent epistemic exclusion that compromises epistemic agency, it is a kind of epistemic oppression. Hence, the concept of epistemic oppression is an umbrella term for multiple ideas of how knowledge production can routinely harm some people and/or populations. Elsewhere I have explored Fricker’s concept of epistemic injustice using my understanding of epistemic oppression. (see Dotson 2012).[14] I borrow this term from Fricker (2007, 17).[15] There are many examples of this kind of epistemic exclusion (see e.g. Code 1995; Collins 2000; Fricker 2007; Williams 1991). For an extended example, see the Rigoberta Menchú controversy (Arias 2001).[16] It is important to note that “minimal” here does not denote “easy” or “adequate.” It is most likely the case, as is the case with Fricker’s testimonial injustice, the changes required to address first-order exclusions are quite extensive (For an account illustrating this, see Langton 2010). However, it is unclear that one needs to abandon the value placed on credibility in order to address the creation of epistemically disadvantaged identities via credibility deficits. I imply this conclusion in my article, “A Cautionary Tale” (2012).[17] For an extended example of the difficulty of the backlash such endeavors invoke see the Rigoberta Menchú controversy (Arias 2001).[18] The additions made to the Allegory are heavily influenced by Fricker’s paradigm case of hermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007).[19] Fricker’s example of hermeneutical injustice concerned the events leading to the creation of the term “sexual harassment,” where experiences with sexual harassment predated the term itself to the detriment of the victims. Many deny the prevalence of this kind of exclusion. They claim that it presumes that at any given time there is but one set of epistemic resources (Mason 2011). However, even if one were to take the reality of alternative epistemologies and epistemic resources into consideration, communicating with those not fluent in those alternative epistemic resources can still foster second-order epistemic exclusion.[20] See, for example (Anzaldúa 1999; Dotson 2011; duCille 2009; Lugones and Spelman 1983).[21] These extensions are influenced by Lorraine Code’s concept of rhetorical space and my concept of contributory injustice (see Code 1995; Dotson 2012).[22] There is a budding debate concerning whether Fricker’s hermeneutical injustice, which I have identified as an example of a second order epistemic injustice, affects all involved knowers equally (see Beeby 2011; Medina 2012).[23] For a good example of similar epistemic ramifications of such clashes (see Bergin 2001).Additional informationNotes on contributorsKristie DotsonKristie Dotson is an assistant professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the concept of contributory injustice—a form of epistemic injustice where marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to shared hermeneutical resources due to willfully ignorant audiences who refuse to acknowledge gaps in collective understanding. Distinguished from Fricker's hermeneutical injustice by emphasizing active exclusion rather than passive absence of concepts. Uses example of academic philosophy's marginalization of certain knowers and knowledge forms.

  RELEVANCE: Contributory injustice directly implicates literature review and citation practices: when reviewers systematically exclude work from marginalized scholars or alternative epistemologies, they enact this injustice. The paper's focus on academic philosophy makes it particularly relevant to understanding citational gatekeeping. The concept of "willful hermeneutical ignorance" applies to reviewers who claim comprehensiveness while excluding marginalized perspectives.

  POSITION: Critical expansion of Fricker emphasizing active dimensions of exclusion. Argues that simply lacking conceptual resources (Fricker's hermeneutical injustice) doesn't capture cases where dominant groups actively prevent marginalized contributions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Documents systematic epistemic injustice in global health bioethics through empirical analysis of knowledge production patterns. Shows Global South epistemologies, theories, and experiences are silenced through three mechanisms: who produces knowledge (predominantly Global North institutions/scholars), what theories are applied (Western philosophical frameworks presented as universal), and whose voices are sought (Global South populations studied but not consulted as epistemic authorities).

Particularly relevant for understanding citational justice as requiring not just demographic inclusion but substantive engagement with alternative epistemologies.

Our shared responsibility to rectify that injustice should be at the top of the ethics agenda. That it is not, or only is in part, is deeply problematic and endangers the credibility of the entire field. As a first step towards reorienting the field, this paper offers a comprehensive account of epistemic justice for global health ethics. We first introduce several different conceptions of justice and decolonisation in relation to knowledge, purposefully drawing on work emanating from the global South as well as the global North. We then apply those conceptions to the global health ethics context to generate a tripartite account of the layers of epistemic justice in the field: who is producing ethics knowledge; what theories and concepts are being applied to produce ethics knowledge; and whose voices are sought, recorded and used to generate ethics knowledge. These layers reflect that the field spans conceptual and empirical research. We conclude by proposing that, going forward, three avenues are key to achieve greater epistemic justice at each layer and to help decolonise global health ethics: namely, understanding the problem, dialogue and structural change.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic review of journal publications (1947-2023) analyzing epistemic inclusivity through six varieties of epistemic justice framework. Identifies citational justice as essential facet of testimonial justice. Shows how citational practices in academic journals reflect and perpetuate epistemic exclusion. Argues for decolonizing knowledge through attention to hermeneutical justice, testimonial justice, interpretive burden, and metalinguistic awareness. Citational justice emerges as critical mechanism for recognizing marginalized epistemic contributions.

  RELEVANCE: Rare paper explicitly connecting citation practices to epistemic justice framework. Provides empirical demonstration of how citational patterns in journals constitute epistemic injustice. The systematic review methodology offers model for analyzing citational justice/injustice. Directly relevant to literature review ethics by showing citational choices as sites of potential injustice. The six-part epistemic justice framework could be applied to evaluate literature review practices.

  POSITION: Applies Foucauldian discourse analysis to epistemic justice. Emphasizes citational justice as form of testimonial recognition. Advocates decolonizing knowledge production through reformed citational practices.

Our systematic review of PAD's publications from 1947 to May 2023 in Atlas.ti seeks to illuminate the operational factors steering the discourse. Using a structured approach, which is rooted in six constitutive varieties of epistemic justice, to guide a Foucauldian discourse analysis, the review gauges epistemic inclusivity in academic works. The results highlight the significance of decolonising knowledge, which is undergirded by pillars like hermeneutic and testimonial justice, the epistemic justice of interpretive burden, and metalinguistic awareness. Notably, the emphasis on citational justice emerges in the findings as an essential facet of testimonial justice.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Empirical survey study identifying three categories of ethically questionable citation behaviors: strategic citations (citing for personal advantage), neglectful citations (failing to cite due to bias/carelessness), and blind citations (citing without reading). Finds that greater experience does not necessarily improve citation practices. Particularly divisive issue: intentionally citing authors from underrepresented demographic groups for social justice reasons. Many respondents viewed this as ethically questionable, revealing tension between epistemic and social justice considerations in citation.

  RELEVANCE: Rare empirical study of citation ethics revealing actual norms and controversies among scholars. The finding that social justice-motivated citation is controversial illuminates key tension for literature review ethics: does citational justice require demographic-based inclusion, or does this constitute "strategic" citation? The three-category framework (strategic, neglectful, blind) could be applied to analyzing citation practices in literature reviews. Shows citation ethics is contested terrain, not settled practice.

  POSITION: Empirical/descriptive rather than normative, but reveals deep disagreements about whether social justice considerations legitimately inform citation. The controversy over demographic-based citation reveals tensions between traditional epistemic norms and citational justice demands.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes that when ethicists face credible allegations of professional sexual misconduct, scholars should cite their work alongside impartial information about allegations rather than either disengaging or proceeding as usual. Argues ethicists are distinct because their power is reproduced through citations, giving scholars moral and intellectual responsibility in citational practices. Suggests citational practice can function as accountability mechanism when institutional justice fails.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses ethics of citation as more than epistemic recognition—citation confers power and authority. Relevant to literature review ethics because it treats citation as morally significant act with consequences beyond knowledge transmission. The argument that scholars have "moral and intellectual responsibility" in citation practices supports viewing citational choices as ethically loaded. The focus on power reproduced through citations illuminates stakes of citational justice/injustice.

 In this article, we explore how to engage with the work of ethicists facing public allegations of professional sexual misconduct. Rather than disengaging or proceeding as usual, we propose citing their work alongside impartial information about credible allegations. We choose to isolate the work of ethicists as the target of this proposal because ethicists are distinct on two fronts: they are distinct among philosophers because they have moral authority, and distinct among others with moral authority, such as religious leaders and civil rights activists, because their power is reproduced in part through citations. Our approach offers a nuanced perspective on the power conferred through citations. We argue that individual scholars have a moral and intellectual responsibility to cite using this practice, especially when institutional enforcement of justice is lacking.},

That is, there's been much work on the epistemology of testimony. However, what about when hearers don't believe speakers when they should? In other words, what are we to make of when testimony goes wrong? A recent topic of interest in epistemology and feminist philosophy is how we sometimes fail to believe speakers due to inappropriate prejudices – implicit or explicit.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker responds to criticisms of her 2007 framework. Addresses questions about relationship between epistemic and ethical dimensions of epistemic injustice, whether virtue ethics approach is sufficient, and scope of testimonial injustice concept. Defends that epistemic injustice is distinctively epistemic (not reducible to ethical wrong) while acknowledging ethical and epistemic are inseparable. Clarifies that testimonial justice virtue requires more than absence of prejudice—requires active, critical reflection.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals debates and refinements around foundational framework. Fricker's defense of distinctively epistemic character of epistemic injustice is relevant to whether citational exclusion constitutes epistemic wrong or merely ethical failing. Her emphasis on active critical reflection (not just passive absence of bias) suggests citational justice requires reflexive examination of one's bibliographic choices. The engagement with critics shows epistemic injustice framework is contested, not settled doctrine.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends Fricker's framework by arguing credibility excess (not just deficit) can constitute testimonial injustice. When speakers from marginalized groups are assigned excess credibility on identity-related topics (as "spokespersons" for their group), this wrongfully reduces them to their identity and burdens them with representational labor. Discusses three patterns: typecasting (assumption that identity determines perspective), tokenism (exceptional individual treated as representative), and spokesperson burden (expectation to speak for entire group). All harm speakers as individual knowers.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant to citation practices and literature review ethics. Shows that simply increasing citation of marginalized scholars can perpetuate injustice if done in identity-reductive ways (citing women only on gender, scholars of color only on race, etc.). Illuminates how "diversity" in bibliographies can still enact epistemic injustice if it tokenizes or typecast authors. Suggests citational justice requires recognizing scholars as individuals with diverse expertise, not merely as group representatives.

  POSITION: Expansion of Fricker's framework. Argues testimonial injustice is broader than credibility deficit. Maintains focus on individual harms while addressing group-level patterns.

I show how positive stereotyping and prejudicially inflated credibility assessments contribute to the continued epistemic oppression of marginalized knowers. In particular, I examine harms such as typecasting, compulsory representation, and epistemic exploitation and consider what hearers are obligated to do in response to these injustices. I argue that because epistemic harms to marginalized knowers also arise from prejudicially inflated assessments of their credibility, the virtue of testimonial justice must be revised to remedy them.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques Fricker's claim that primary harm of testimonial injustice is epistemic objectification (treating speaker as mere object/informant rather than knower). Argues primary harm is better understood as derivatization—treating someone as derived/dependent rather than autonomous epistemic agent. Emphasizes that testimonial exchanges are mutual, requiring active participation from both speaker and hearer; derivatization violates this mutuality by denying speaker's epistemic agency and autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to understanding how citational practices can wrong authors as epistemic agents. If citing someone's work while systematically misrepresenting or decontextualizing it treats them as mere information source (objectification), or if citing only to critique without genuine engagement denies their autonomous epistemic standing (derivatization), this constitutes testimonial injustice. The emphasis on mutuality suggests literature reviews must engage work cited, not merely extract from it.

I first analyze Fricker's account of the harm, which she posits in terms of a subject/object relation as "epistemic objectification." My analysis, however, shows that (1) testimonial injustice does not render its victim to an object-like status and (2) testimonial injustice necessarily treats its victim as a subject, albeit a truncated subject. Drawing on the work of Ann Cahill and Simone de Beauvoir, I demonstrate that the primary harm of testimonial injustice is more aptly described in terms of a subject/other relation, or a relation that circumscribes the subjectivity of its victim within the confines of the perpetrator's subjectivity. Using these conceptual resources to examine the primary epistemic harm of testimonial injustice not only avoids the problems I raise with the notion of epistemic objectification, but also greatly enhances our understanding of testimonial injustice, and consequently of what more epistemically just relations look like.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces "testimonial void"—when a speaker withholds epistemic materials from a hearer-to-be based on faulty assumption that hearer lacks capacity to use them epistemically. Unlike Dotson's testimonial smothering (speaker withholds due to anticipated prejudice from hearer), testimonial void involves speaker's own prejudice about hearer's epistemic capacities. This is a form of silencing where would-be knowers are denied access to testimony due to prejudice. Shows testimonial injustice can be enacted by speakers, not just hearers.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to literature review practices when scholars withhold their work from certain venues/audiences based on prejudiced assumptions about those audiences' epistemic capacities (e.g., assuming certain scholars/communities cannot engage with sophisticated arguments). Also relevant to accessibility issues in academic writing—when scholars deliberately write inaccessibly based on faulty assumptions about who merits access to knowledge. Illuminates bidirectional nature of testimonial injustice in scholarly communication.

  POSITION: Extension of testimonial injustice framework. Shows speakers can also be wrongdoers in testimonial injustice (not only victims). Emphasizes epistemic trust and relational equality dimensions.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, I characterize a new kind of testimonial injustice (TI), a phenomenon I call ‘testimonial void’ (TV), which involves a substantial extension of the limits of the original concept put forward by Miranda Fricker. TV occurs when a speaker withholds epistemic materials on the basis of an epistemically and ethically faulty assumption that a hearer-to-be lacks the capacity to do anything epistemically relevant with them. As in testimonial smothering (TS), testimony is not proffered owing to an anticipated failure of uptake. However, unlike in cases of TS, the anticipated failure of uptake in TV is due to prejudice on the speaker’s part. By comparing TV with other forms of TI, I show that TV shares TI’s conceptual structure and harms. I argue that TV: a) shows the speaker to be a potential wrongdoer, b) reveals that TI cannot be equated with biased credibility assessments, c) entails both an indirect yet extreme form of silencing and d) the failure to extend a kind of epistemic trust implied by the enjoyment of epistemic relational equality. In addition, I explore intricate cases in which TV interacts with TS, identifying smothered instances of TV, as well as non-culpable cases of TV.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Fricker's objectification account of testimonial injustice's primary harm against Pohlhaus's derivatization alternative. Argues that enriching conception of epistemic objectification (drawing on Martha Nussbaum's cluster analysis) better captures harms than othering/derivatization framework. Shows cases where epistemic agency is affirmed but credibility unjustly impugned can still be understood as objectification when using nuanced account. Maintains objectification framework while acknowledging othering may offer supplementary resources.

  RELEVANCE: Contributes to understanding what makes citational exclusion or misrepresentation a distinctive epistemic wrong. If primary harm is objectification (reducing author to mere information source, denying epistemic agency), this explains why proper citation requires genuine engagement—not just formal attribution. Suggests citational justice requires recognizing cited authors as epistemic agents with autonomous contributions, not mere sources to extract from.

  abstract = {This paper re-examines the debate between those who, with Miranda Fricker, diagnose the primary, non-contingent harm of testimonial injustice as a kind of epistemic objectification and those who contend it is better thought of as a kind of epistemic othering. Defenders of the othering account of the primary harm have often argued for it by presenting cases of testimonial injustice in which the testifier’s epistemic agency is affirmed rather than denied, even while their credibility is unjustly impugned. In previous work, I have instead argued that such cases suggest that we need to enrich our conception of epistemic objectification in ways encouraged by Martha Nussbaum’s cluster analysis of objectification. Here I continue to make the case for this approach, and I consider the othering account in more detail. I focus in particular on Gaile Pohlhaus Jr.’s arguments for a version of the othering account in terms of the notion of derivatization, which turns on the idea that only such an account can enable us to properly understand the harms of testimonial injustice, in particular the ways in which it interferes with a subject’s epistemic agency and autonomy, and I’ll argue that such arguments should not sway us. Finally, I’ll further support my contention that it is illuminating and helpful to think of the primary harm of testimonial injustice in terms of epistemic objectification, though I will concede that the notion of epistemic othering may offer further helpful resources for understanding how subjects can be harmed by testimonial injustice.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Pratt and de Vries's account of epistemic justice, probing nuances of "inclusion" as remedy for epistemic injustice. Questions whether inclusion should operate within binary North/South vocabulary, whether inclusion can paradoxically produce exclusion (through tokenism or elite capture), and whether inclusion as "politics of belonging" creates new epistemic harms through authenticity demands. Warns that increasing representation without transforming underlying epistemic structures may create appearance of inclusion while leaving exclusion intact (internal exclusion).

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis directly relevant to debates about citational justice and diversity in literature reviews. Warns that simply including more scholars from Global South (or other marginalized groups) may not achieve epistemic justice if underlying power structures remain. The concept of "internal exclusion" (being formally included but substantively marginalized) applies to tokenistic citation practices. Elite capture warning relevant to concerns about who gets to represent marginalized perspectives in bibliographies.

  keywords = {epistemic-justice, inclusion, decolonization, global-south, elite-capture, Low},
  abstract = {Bridget Pratt and Jantina de Vries have made an insightful contribution to enhancing epistemic justice in global health ethics. Their elaboration details intellectual (external) exclusion— described as nonrepresentation—across three levels, and at its core, proposes inclusion to rectify this. To extend this work, we contend that it is worth probing the nuances and challenges associated with inclusion as a response to epistemic injustice. These include (A) the meaning of inclusion outside binary vocabularies of north and south; (B) the possibility of forms of inclusion that produce exclusion and (C) inclusion as a politics of belonging with intellectual confinement as a possible epistemic harm. How the problem of injustice is described influences the substantive meaning of inclusion. In describing epistemic injustice, north and south (centre and periphery) are used as relational markers of power, inclusion, authority and exclusion. While this binary vocabulary is seductive, it can appear to confer proprietary rights to the concepts, theories and values described as originating in the global north (and south). However, such inscriptions of ownership are not always a correct reading of the problem. Sometimes, the ostensible westernness and nonwesternness of ideas are taken for granted, particularly when histories of connection and exchange go unacknowledged. Even if we grant that an idea has its geodiscursive origin in the global north, there is the separate issue of whether it is ever fully constituted in this epistemic location. Therefore, while Pratt and de Vries are right to seek the representation of voices and debates that position themselves as southern, epistemic justice can also entail abandoning the presumption of discrete intellectual traditions by illuminating histories of interaction, exchange and connection, although in unequal encounters. This frames inclusion as an effort in reclamation and appropriation, inscribing Africa and the global south in the genealogy and intellectual history of ideas routinely taken for granted as northern. A second set of issues relates to whether including scholarship from the global south necessarily means that these perspectives are more heard. Sometimes, inclusion can be an instrument of exclusion, a way of (un)consciously weakening the radical claims being pursued. This erosion can occur through internal exclusion, which is the experience of exclusion by individuals positioned as included/represented. This shows that exclusion and inclusion are not always binaries. Increasing visibility through representation of previously excluded knowers and knowledge systems that fit the social descriptions of prime targets for inclusion may enhance optics but direct attention away from the phenomenon of exclusion itself. To consolidate inclusion that matters, internal exclusion should be central to an understanding of exclusion. In order to mitigate the appearance of inclusion, it is important to scrutinise, for example, the language of ‘standards’ and associated processes of establishing epistemic authority, as sites of internal exclusion. Although we lack the space to provide details, this more transformative inclusion regards the epistemologies that are accounted for in the construction of what is meaningful in global health ethics. In addition to which priorities are favoured and by whom, the inclusion that matters involves unravelling the politics of knowledge (production and conversion), particularly in relation to how standards are (re) influenced, (re)developed, (re)validated and fed into the priorities and discourses constitutive of global health ethics. Rather than an exhaustive statement on what constitutes inclusive practices, Pratt and de Vries’ contribution should be taken as impetus to think and rethink inclusion and epistemic justice. The denuding of inclusion can also occur through elite capture, which is ‘the control over the political agendas and resources by a group’s most advantaged people.’ Elite capture points to the possibility that those likely to be included/ deferred to are insufficiently representative of the material conditions and intellectual concerns of the locations they are expected to represent. More cynically, outcomes like elite capture render grammars of inclusion, like epistemic justice, as nothing more than campaigns for parochial power and esteem. Pratt and de Vries do pay some attention to this by effectively outlining epistemic justice as having beneficiaries outside academic elites. As such, epistemic justice would need to be seen as an ongoing commitment to being accountable and responsive to those who are not yet in the room by deliberately cultivating the ‘practical and material bases for popular power over knowledge production and distribution.’ Finally, it is worth paying attention to the politics of belonging that often accompanies the pursuit of inclusion. On a practical level, including voices and perspectives from the global south means making political and ethical judgements about what counts as knowledge from the global south and who qualifies for recognition as African/southern. This means generating values by which membership is judged, such that a key issue becomes the very boundedness of a particular epistemic location. Do these values broaden or constrict the canvass on which southern/ African ideas are painted? Do they constrain or expand the possibilities for negotiating inclusion? While Pratt and de Vries foreground the question of ‘where is knowledge from the global south’, the equally salient question of who/what is recognised as southern lurks around the corner. The political nature of belonging is evident, for example, in the suggestion that one may be from the south geographically but not intellectually. An interest in voices that think from a southern/African location, we imagine, would involve generating criteria of what those voices sound like, and this is inevitably a normative project. With this comes the possibility of an altogether new epistemic harm within the talk of inclusion, whereby expectations of authenticity work to enclose and confine southern scholars within a narrow set of themes, concepts, debates and intellectual traditions.},

 It is a common contention that education done uncritically and unreflectively may serve to sustain and justify the status quo, in terms of mechanisms of cultural or racial privileging and marginalization. This article explores an argument made from within anti-oppressive education theory and advocated by theorist Kevin Kumashiro, namely that transformative education must entail altering harmful citational practices. I see two shortcomings in relation to this argument: first, its focus on discursive practice entails a prerequisite of high discursive literacy. Second, it may lead to a failure to give credit to people’s intentions, risking a conflation of honest mistakes and wilful ignorance, and depriving us of theoretical nuance. While a well-argued and important call, I argue in this article that both shortcomings lead to the risk of a polarized conversation. Focusing on cultural, ethnic and racial categorization, and using social studies as an illustration, it is suggested that applying notions from the theoretical concept of epistemic injustice may open up a space for granting nuanced credit to people’s intentions, thereby mitigating the risk of polarization. Rather than viewing attention to outcome and attention to intention as oppositional to one another, it is argued that both theoretical perspectives may benefit from the insights of the other. By applying needed context-specificity and nuance to categorizations of dominance and marginalization in individual discursive exchange, this can be done without granting priority to the experience of dominantly situated knowers.},

  abstract = {In this study, we analyse a comprehensive database (from 1960 to June 2024) of scientific publications in AI Ethics (n= 5755) using Web of Science (WoS) as a data source, to generate quantitative insights around the research trends within the field. We systematically curate the initial data to conduct a co-authorship and co-citation analysis with highly cited research outputs (n = 500) and a co-word analysis with most relevant research outputs (n = 1000). These bibliometric analyses result in multiple networked visualisations that map the status quo and the nature of current citational and collaborative practices among the experts, institutions and countries involved in global AI Ethics research. Using Sheila Jasanoff’s co-production theory as a conceptual lens, we analyse these findings and show that the experts from the Global North currently legitimise their expertise in AI Ethics through dynamic citational and collaborative practices in knowledge production within the field. Collectively, they shape the discourses and institutional ways of understanding around the ethical development of AI technologies worldwide. This techno-politics of knowledge-making in AI Ethics culminates in creating epistemic injustice for the Global South. Drawing from Miranda Fricker and prominent feminist and postcolonial theorists, we explain how such injustice is produced and distributed through patterned pathways of co-production of AI Ethics. Thus, we show that the global project of AI Ethics fails to deliver its promise to be universally useful by keeping the global majority populations in the Southern regions marginalized as ‘others’.},

  doi = {10.1353/book22395},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book documents how the modern Western philosophical canon
  was constructed through explicitly racist exclusions of African and Asian thought
  in 19th-century German historiography. Park traces how Kant, Hegel, and their
  successors systematically denied philosophical status to non-European traditions
  using racial arguments about capacity for abstract thought. The exclusion was
  not based on ignorance—European scholars knew these traditions—but on deliberate
  ideological construction. Park examines the institutional, pedagogical, and
  textual mechanisms through which this racialized canon became naturalized as
  "the history of philosophy" itself.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding how canon formation operates as an
  exclusionary political practice rather than neutral recognition of merit. Directly
  relevant to literature reviews because it shows how defining "what counts as
  philosophy" precedes and shapes any survey of "the philosophical literature."
  Park's analysis of how historiographical narratives construct canons parallels
  how literature reviews construct their objects. His documentation of racist
  arguments reveals the contingency of current canonical boundaries.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Waithe analyzes the processes through which excluded philosophers—
  particularly women—might be integrated into the philosophical canon. Drawing on
  her decades of recovery work editing the four-volume *History of Women Philosophers*,
  she examines obstacles to canon revision including genre dismissal (treating women's
  philosophical writing as "not philosophy"), institutional gatekeeping, and the
  circular logic that excludes figures for lack of influence when exclusion itself

  Relevant to literature review methodology because it illuminates how disciplinary
  boundaries and genre hierarchies shape what gets included as "relevant literature."

  CORE ARGUMENT: Graness examines the challenges of writing a history of philosophy
  for African traditions, arguing that the discipline of history of philosophy has
  been instrumental in shaping exclusionary canons. She shows how African philosophical
  thought (traceable to ancient Egypt) has been systematically excluded through
  historiographical practices that privilege certain textual forms and conceptual
  frameworks. Graness argues that decolonizing the history of philosophy requires
  "conceptual decolonisation" (following Wiredu)—questioning the very categories
  through which philosophy is defined. The difficulty of writing African philosophy's
  history reveals how Eurocentric frameworks structure the discipline itself.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how historiographical practices shape canons and what
  counts as "philosophy." Directly relevant to literature review methodology because
  it shows how definitional questions precede empirical surveys—deciding what
  counts as "philosophical literature" already enacts exclusions. Graness's emphasis
  on conceptual decolonization suggests literature reviews must interrogate their

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume brings together diverse perspectives on how
  historiographical practices shape philosophical canons. Contributors examine case
  studies from multiple traditions (Western, Chinese, Indian) and historical periods

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dhawan critiques the Eurocentric presumption that philosophy is
  fundamentally European, showing how Enlightenment universalism was constructed
  through colonial exclusions. She debunks claims that Kantian cosmopolitanism
  provided an antidote to colonialism, instead documenting how Enlightenment
  philosophy participated in epistemic violence that delegitimized non-European
  thought. Dhawan argues that simply "including" previously marginalized traditions
  within existing philosophical frameworks proves insufficient—the frameworks
  themselves must be decolonized. Drawing on Spivak, she proposes "transnational
  literacy" and "planetary ethics" as alternatives to liberal multicultural inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the fundamental question of what counts as "philosophy" and
  whose knowledge receives epistemic recognition. Directly relevant to literature
  reviews because it questions whether adding "diverse voices" to existing review
  structures addresses the deeper epistemic frameworks that enabled exclusion.
  Dhawan's critique of liberal inclusion suggests literature reviews require
  methodological transformation, not just expanded scope. Her emphasis on uneven

One of the most pervasive repercussions of the claim that the Enlightenment was always already anti‐imperial is that postcolonial critique is rendered redundant, and the project of decolonizing European philosophy becomes unnecessary. Contesting the exoneration of Enlightenment philosophers of racism and sexism, this article debunks the claim that Kantian cosmopolitanism was an antidote to colonialism. Addressing the ambivalent legacies of the European Enlightenment for the postcolonial world, with special focus on the “Syrian refugee crisis,” the article examines the enduring normative violence exerted by Enlightenment principles of cosmopolitanism and outlines the contested terrains that inflect current geopolitics of knowledge‐production. Given that the normative idea of philosophy, as defined during the Enlightenment, continues to delegitimize non‐European perspectives, the integration of previously marginalized knowledges into the philosophical canon is insufficient; rather, in order to desubalternize non‐Western epistemologies, it is imperative to undo the uneven distribution of epistemic agency globally. Drawing on Gayatri Spivak's ideas of transnational literacy and planetary ethics, the article concludes by underscoring the contribution of postcolonial‐feminist critique in imagining postimperial philosophy in a global age.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosfoguel argues that Westernized universities are structured by
  "epistemic racism/sexism"—the systematic privileging of knowledge produced by men
  from five Western European countries as universally valid while dismissing all other
  knowledge as particular, traditional, or non-scientific. He traces this structure
  to four epistemicides of the long 16th century: conquest of Al-Andalus, conquest
  of Americas, African enslavement, and European witch hunts. These genocides
  destroyed entire knowledge systems and ways of knowing. Modern disciplines embody
  this epistemic structure, with theory reduced to white European male experience
  presented as universal.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical framework for understanding how canon formation
  operates as "epistemicide"—not just exclusion but active destruction of knowledge
  systems. Directly relevant to literature reviews because it challenges the assumption
  that "relevant literature" can be identified through neutral bibliographic search—
  the very infrastructure of knowledge production embeds exclusionary structures.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kim distinguishes between "alterior" philosophies (culturally

A central focus is the distinction between those philosophies of formerly colonized peoples that are culturally alterior or, simply, alterior and those that are analectical in the Dusselian sense of emerging from a subordinated political position. The paper begins by reflecting upon connections between coloniality, the alterior, and the analectical to frame the discussion of epistemic decolonization in the philosophy profession. It then considers a knower's core theoretic reconstruction in the task of epistemic decolonization and identifies some ambiguities in reconciling alterior traditions with analectical theoretical reconstruction. The work of Charles Mills and Enrique Dussel are considered as case studies. The paper concludes with critical reflections on the institutional network of canon, curriculum, and other conceptual and credentialization structures that constitute institutional Eurocentrism.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Connell and Janssen-Lauret analyze how evaluative labels like
  "bad philosophy" and "derivative philosophy" have been weaponized to exclude women
  from the philosophical canon. They focus on early-to-mid 20th century analytic
  women philosophers who published in mainstream journals and held philosophy
  positions, yet were systematically dismissed and forgotten. The authors show how
  these exclusions occurred through subtextual mechanisms—not explicit claims that
  "women can't philosophize" but dismissals of specific women's work as insufficiently
  original or rigorous. They argue these evaluative practices reveal implicit bias
  in how "good philosophy" is recognized.

  RELEVANCE: Exposes mechanisms of canon gatekeeping beyond explicit exclusion,
  showing how evaluative criteria can function as implicit exclusion. Directly
  relevant to literature reviews because it illuminates how judgments of "relevance,"
  "importance," or "quality" can embed bias. The authors' focus on women who met
  all formal criteria yet were excluded suggests literature reviews must examine
  not just who gets included but how evaluative standards themselves may be biased.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bergès examines why recovered women philosophers remain on "the
  outskirts of the canon"—known individually but not integrated into standard
  narratives of philosophy's development. She argues the "lone female philosopher"
  framing (pairing each woman with a canonical male figure) obscures the intellectual
  networks and conversations among women philosophers themselves. Bergès proposes
  three strategies: creating courses focused entirely on women philosophers to
  establish their intellectual traditions, pairing women with canonical men as
  interlocutors, and reconstructing women's intellectual networks. She examines
  barriers to integration including pedagogical structures and historiographical
  conventions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses why recovery work alone doesn't transform canons, relevant
  to debates about literature review reform. Bergès's analysis of the "lone female
  philosopher" problem illuminates how inclusion can occur without challenging
  underlying narrative structures. Her pedagogical focus connects to how literature
  reviews teach readers what counts as "the conversation" in a field. The emphasis

Yet in ordinary life, we frequently hold individuals responsible who are deficient in these capacities, such as children or people with mental illness. The existing literature that addresses these cases has suggested that we merely pretend to hold these agents responsible or that they are responsible to a diminished degree. In this paper, I demonstrate that neither of these approaches is satisfactory, and I offer an alternative focused on the role relationships play in determining whether it is appropriate to hold someone responsible. I argue that relationships are sources of normative expectations about how parties in that relationship ought to behave and that we can be responsible in virtue of being subject to these norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Shapiro distinguishes three elements of a philosophical canon:
  a causal story (how ideas develop), core philosophical questions, and distinctively

  early modern philosophy within history of science subtly shifts what counts as

  changing the questions asked transforms who counts as answering them. This suggests
  canon revision requires rethinking core problems, not just adding new figures.

  RELEVANCE: Provides analytical framework for understanding canon structure beyond
  mere lists of figures. Directly relevant to literature reviews because it shows
  how problem-definition shapes what literature becomes relevant—reviews don't just
  survey existing literature but constitute their object through how they frame

It is important to recognise, however, that the canon is, in large part, a device designed to compensate for our own human cognitive limitations: there is only so much that we can hold in memory and intellectually manage at one time. If, instead, we had a means of expanding our storage and processing capacities to indefinite size and speed, 'the canon' might be dramatically expanded in size, or even be eliminated altogether in favour of using the entire corpus of a given author, period or philosophical perspective. The new 'digital history' enables us to do exactly that by externalising (certain aspects of) our scholarly work to computers, and then using the output (often an information-dense data visualisation) to advance our knowledge further than would have been possible by means of native brainpower alone. In this chapter, the author discusses these issues and then briefly reviews four instances of digital historical work on the disciplinary boundary between philosophy and psychology in order to provide a variety of examples in which this emerging new approach to scholarship can work for historians of philosophy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smith examines canon formation in the period immediately after
  Kant, bringing together three contemporary scholarly strands: critique of the
  rationalism/empiricism distinction (Vanzo), histories of women's exclusion
  (O'Neill), and histories of non-European philosophy's exclusion (Park). He shows
  how post-Kantian historiography of philosophy constructed a narrative that
  simultaneously established Kant as the culmination of modern philosophy and
  excluded both women and non-European traditions. Smith argues these exclusions
  were mutually reinforcing, with similar mechanisms operating across different
  marginalized groups.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how canon formation operates through historiographical
  narrative construction, not just individual exclusions. Relevant to literature
  reviews because it shows how narratives of intellectual development shape what
  counts as "foundational literature." Smith's integration of feminist and
  decolonial critiques suggests literature reviews should attend to intersectional
  dimensions of exclusion. His focus on post-Kantian period shows how canonical

In response to 'the problem of representation', some argue that, because the canon is inherently racist, sexist, elitist or otherwise hierarchical, it should be abolished altogether. Others argue that despite a lamentable history of exclusion, the canon should be preserved and made more inclusive or pluralistic. The author offers a third response: we ought to reimagine the canon in a way that helps us to understand why certain contributions have been wrongly excluded and that encourages us to reconsider who belongs on the list. To help make his case, the author introduces the reader to four (non-canonical) Mexican philosophers to make three points. First, the traditional canon is imperialistic in the sense that it is based on an understanding of the Western tradition that justifies our ignorance of other traditions and makes us indifferent to our ignorance. Second, the purpose of canonical works is to help us grow into our full humanity. Third, we ought to understand our common humanity in terms of the precariousness and fragility of human existence that one Mexican philosopher calls our 'common accidentality'.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Westphal argues the philosophical canon functions as a "flexible,
  normative fact"—neither rigidly fixed nor purely arbitrary, but open to revision
  while maintaining normative force. He examines how canons balance continuity with
  change, allowing for gradual shifts while preserving enough stability for
  intergenerational conversation. Westphal defends canons against complete relativism
  while acknowledging their contingency and revisability. He argues canonical status
  emerges through collective recognition rather than intrinsic properties, but this
  social construction doesn't render canons merely ideological.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical analysis of canons' normative status, relevant
  to debates about whether literature reviews should defer to or contest canonical
  judgments. Westphal's "flexible normative fact" framework suggests literature
  reviews both reflect and shape what counts as central literature, participating
  in ongoing collective negotiations over canonicity. His emphasis on enabling
  intergenerational conversation raises questions about how literature reviews
  balance tradition with innovation.

  POSITION: Moderate position defending canons' value while acknowledging contingency.
  Philosophical analysis of normative status.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Davidson develops a truth-theoretic approach to meaning where interpretation proceeds via radical interpretation constrained by the principle of charity. The principle requires that we maximize agreement and attribute rationality to speakers, treating their beliefs as largely true and consistent, as a condition for making sense of their utterances. This framework treats meaning and belief as interdependent and resolved simultaneously through charitable interpretation.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the principle of charity as central to interpretation theory. Directly relevant to literature review methodology as it articulates the interpretive obligations when representing others' philosophical positions. Davidson's argument that massive error is ruled out by the conditions of interpretability provides philosophical grounding for charitable reading practices, though recent critics question whether this principle is applied uniformly across academic philosophy.

  POSITION: Represents the Davidsonian constitutive view that charity is not merely advisable but required for interpretation to succeed—it is a transcendental condition rather than an ethical recommendation.

  keywords = {principle-of-charity, radical-interpretation, Davidson, High},
  abstract = {Abstract This volume collects Davidson's seminal contributions to the philosophy of language. Its key insight is that the concept of truth can shed light on various issues connected to meaning: Davidson, who assumes a partial and primitive understanding of the truth predicate, reverses Tarski who had succeeded in elucidating the concept of truth by taking the notion of ‘translation’ (preservation of meaning) for granted. In the first of five subsections into which the papers are thematically organized, Davidson develops the systematic constraints a theory of meaning has to meet and shows how an approach to semantics based on the concept of truth meets these demands better than any rival approach. Sect. 2 explores whether one can give semantic analyses of quotation, intensional contexts, and force within the extensional limitations of the truth‐theoretic framework. Viewing the theories of meaning developed in the first section as empirical, Sect. 3 inquires into their testability: can we verify these theories without presupposing concepts too closely aligned to that of meaning, interpretation, and synonymy? Davidson develops constitutive constraints on applying truth theories to interpret the speech behaviour of others: we have to view utterances for the most part as assertions of the speaker's beliefs and those beliefs as largely true and consistent (he terms this the ‘Principle of Charity’). Sect. 4 combines these interpretative constraints with the semantic concept of truth developed in Sect. 1 to tackle metaphysical issues. Davidson claims that truth is not relative to conceptual schemes but only to languages that can be shown to be largely correct about the world; consequently, by studying those languages via the semantic concept of truth we can derive ontological conclusions. Sect. 5 explores aspects of linguistic usage that form a particular threat to theories of meaning (such as Davidson's) that focus on the literal meaning of sentences: for truth theory to be adequate as a general theory of language, it must give valid accounts of sentence mood, illocutionary force, and metaphorical meaning.},

  doi = {10.1017/hyp.2023.1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lockard identifies a "charitability gap" in academic philosophy where charitable interpretation is selectively applied—demanded disproportionately from marginalized scholars while extended generously to canonical (often white, male) authors, even when they espouse racist or sexist views. This selective charity perpetuates epistemic oppression by creating conditions for testimonial smothering, functions as an "orientation device" enforcing disciplinary conformity, and requires resistant philosophers to remain in oppressive interpretive worlds.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for the ethics of literature review methodology. Exposes how supposedly neutral interpretive principles can be deployed in ways that shore up disciplinary hierarchies. Raises the question of whether literature reviews should apply uniform charity or whether some positions (e.g., those perpetuating oppression) merit less generous interpretation. Directly challenges the assumption that charity is an unproblematic methodological virtue.

  POSITION: Represents critical/feminist scholarship questioning the politics of interpretation. While not advocating abandonment of charity entirely, Lockard shows that its selective application is a mechanism of epistemic injustice in scholarly practice.

  abstract = {Abstract In this article, I explore some harms that emerge from the call for charity in academic philosophy. A charitability gap, I suggest, exists both between who we tend to read charitably and who we tend to expect charitability from. This gap shores up the disciplinary status quo and (re)produces epistemic oppression, which helps preserve philosophy's status as a discipline that is, to use Charles Mills's language, conceptually and demographically dominated by whiteness and maleness (Mills 1998, 2). I am particularly interested in calls for charity made in response to critiques of racist or sexist authors/texts. I suggest that in these cases, interpretive charity perpetuates epistemic violence by creating conditions for testimonial smothering (Dotson 2011); that it functions as an orientation device (Ahmed 2006) designed to bring “unruly” philosophers back in line with disciplinary practices and traditions; and that it requires resistant philosophers to remain in oppressive worlds (Lugones 2003a; Pohlhaus 2011). Although charitability is risky—and charity is disproportionately demanded from already marginalized philosophers—I am hesitant to abandon charity entirely. The outright rejection of charitable orientations toward texts or others commits philosophers to a purity politics that, following Alexis Shotwell, I suggest we resist (Shotwell 2016).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vandevelde argues that charity in interpretation is both an epistemic and moral virtue, not merely a methodological principle as in Davidson. Drawing on Gregory the Great's 6th-century hermeneutics, Vandevelde shows that charity involves attraction to the good in a teleological process, making the interpreter not just a technician following rules but a moral agent acting in community. He criticizes Davidson's version for assuming beliefs can be ascribed without prior interpretation when interpreters and subjects don't share cultural/historical backgrounds.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges analytic philosophy of language and virtue epistemology with religious hermeneutics, offering a richer account of charity than purely procedural models. Relevant to literature reviews as it suggests that representing others' views is not just a technical matter of correct interpretation but involves moral qualities of the interpreter. Raises questions about what virtues (beyond charity) should guide scholarly engagement with texts.

In the second section, I examine the notion of epistemic virtue as discussed in virtue epistemology and question whether an epistemic virtue can be completely separated from a moral virtue. In the third section, I show how Gregory the Great, Father of the Church and Pope in the 6th century, understands the virtue of charity in interpretation not as a motivation (in a causal process of interpretation, as in virtue epistemology) but as an attraction to the good (in a teleological process) so that the interpreter is not only a technician producing an interpretation (following a “principle” of charity, as in Davidson) but a moral agent acting in a community.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: De Caro and Vaccarezza develop a "principle of phronetic charity" that integrates Aristotelian practical wisdom (phronesis) with the principle of charity. They argue that interpretation requires not just maximizing agreement but exercising good judgment about when and how to apply charity, taking into account the specific context, the interpreter's relationship to the text, and the ethical stakes of the interpretation. This phronetic approach makes charity context-sensitive rather than an invariant rule.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a middle path between treating charity as an absolute requirement (Davidson) and critiquing its misapplication (Lockard). Directly relevant to literature review methodology as it suggests that representing others' views requires interpretive judgment shaped by practical wisdom—not mechanical application of rules. The emphasis on context-sensitivity addresses how literature reviews must adapt charitable reading to different disciplinary contexts and rhetorical situations.

  abstract = {The recent discussions on the unity of virtue (or lack thereof) suffer from a lack of reference to the processes through which we interpret each other as moral agents. In the present paper it is argued that much light can be thrown on that crucial issue by appealing to a version of Donald Davidson’s Principle of Charity, which we call “Principle of Phronetic Charity”. The idea is that in order to treat somebody as a moral agent, one has first to attribute to them, at least pro tempore, a significant degree of practical wisdom (intended as ethical expertise) and, then, to assess and rationally adjust such attribution of competence via actual engagement with them – a process that may lead to different responses on the part of the interpreter (i.e., the confirmation, upgrading, or withdrawing of the preliminary interpretation). After expounding and defending the Principle of Phronetic Charity and the interpretive practices connected with it, we discuss the repercussions of our account on the issue of the epistemic access to virtue. We will show, in particular, that some important components of both disunitarianism and unitarianism have to be retained: in accordance with the former, we stress the role of concrete experience over pure speculation and, up to a point, the idea that virtues tend to form variegated ensembles; in accordance with the latter, we accept the claim that virtues are not attributed to moral agents in isolation. Ultimately, however, the account developed here rejects both the atomism of the disunitarian view and the holism of the “Unity of the Virtues”, since it is in fact a form of molecularism, according to which virtues come neither individually nor as a whole, but rather as clusters},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewiński identifies a fundamental paradox in applying the principle of charity to argumentation: being charitable to one party in a dispute often requires being uncharitable to the other party. Since argumentation involves at least two parties who disagree, an analyst who interprets one party's position in the strongest possible way may be forced to interpret the other party's position as weaker. Lewiński argues this paradox requires significantly limiting the application of charity depending on contextual factors and the analyst's dialectical role.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for literature review methodology where one is synthesizing positions that are often in disagreement with each other. Raises the question of whether representing competing positions in a literature review requires taking sides or whether a neutral stance is possible. The paradox highlights that "charitable" representation is not simply a matter of being fair to individual authors but involves complex decisions about how to construct the overall dialectical space.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pruś and Sikora propose a modified "dialectical principle of charity" that addresses problems in Davidson's version by incorporating procedures from Ignatius Loyola's presupponendum and pragma-dialectics.

This procedural approach makes charity actionable in argumentation contexts.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stevens argues that there is a pro tanto moral duty to be charitable in argument, but the amount of charitable effort required varies depending on the type of dialogue. In non-institutionalized contexts, arguers have influence over the dialogue type adopted. Stevens distinguishes egocentric charity (interpreting arguments as strong from the interpreter's viewpoint), emic charity (interpreting as strong from the arguer's viewpoint), and complex charity (uniting both), arguing only complex charity avoids "toxic charity."

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethical dimensions of charitable interpretation relevant to literature review methodology. The distinction between types of charity illuminates different ways scholars might represent others' work—reconstructing positions to be strongest by current lights versus trying to capture how authors themselves understood their positions. The concept of "toxic charity" is particularly relevant to concerns about condescending or distorting representations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Glüer investigates the modal status of the principle of charity, asking whether it is a priori or a posteriori, and what kind of necessity it has. She argues that while Davidson treats charity as a priori and conceptually necessary (constitutive of belief and meaning), there is reason to think of it as an empirical truth. Even if charity is essential to belief and meaning, it might be an a posteriori necessity rather than a conceptual truth, and our ordinary modal intuitions might support only psychological-nomological necessity, not metaphysical necessity.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses fundamental questions about the philosophical status of interpretive principles. If charity is merely psychologically necessary (how we happen to interpret) rather than metaphysically necessary (how we must interpret), this has implications for its normative force in literature review methodology. Suggests that prescriptions about charitable reading need grounding in something other than conceptual necessity.

Because of Davidson's semantic behaviourism, charity's significance is both epistemic and metaphysical: charity not only provides the radical interpreter with a method for constructing a semantic theory on the basis of his data, but it does so because it is the principle metaphysically determining meaning. In this paper, I assume that charity does determine meaning. On this assumption, I investigate both its epistemic and metaphysical status: is charity a priori or a posteriori? And what kind of necessity does it have? According to Davidson himself, charity is an a priori truth and its necessity is conceptual: it is essential to, or constitutive of, our common concepts of meaning and belief. Not only does this generate tension within Davidson's own, Quine-inspired epistemology, but there is independent reason to think of charity as an empirical truth. Even so, charity might be essential to belief and meaning in the sense of being an a posteriori necessity. I conclude that our ordinary modal intuitions might well support charity's psychological-nomological necessity, but that they do not reach all the way to metaphysical necessity.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer's hermeneutics emphasizes that understanding involves the fusion of the interpreter's horizon with the text's horizon, mediated by tradition and historical consciousness. Prejudices (Vorurteile) are not obstacles to understanding but enabling conditions. The hermeneutic circle—understanding parts through the whole and the whole through parts—characterizes all interpretation. Against method-centered approaches, Gadamer argues understanding is a mode of being-in-the-world rather than applying interpretive rules.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to Davidsonian charity for thinking about interpretation in literature reviews. Gadamer's emphasis on historical consciousness and the role of tradition suggests literature reviews must attend to how texts are situated in evolving traditions, not just interpret them by current standards. The fusion of horizons model implies that understanding others' work changes the interpreter, relevant to how engagement with literature should transform one's own thinking.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dresner explores the implications of Davidson's principle of charity for intercultural communication, where differences in cultural background potentially challenge the assumption of shared beliefs and rationality. He argues that even in cases of significant cultural difference, charity remains necessary for recognizing others as language users and believers, though the specific content of charitable attributions may differ. The principle's requirement to maximize agreement is compatible with recognizing deep disagreements about specific topics.

  RELEVANCE: Extends charity to contexts where interpreters and subjects have different cultural frameworks, relevant to literature reviews engaging with texts from different intellectual traditions or historical periods. Addresses the tension between recognizing genuine differences and the need for shared background assumptions. Relevant to debates about whether literature reviews must prioritize the authors' own cultural contexts or can interpret through contemporary frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Standard citation-based bibliometric tools have severe limitations for periods before current citation practices. Presents method for extracting and analyzing mentions (not just formal citations) to map scholarly networks in Anglophone philosophy 1890-1979. Successfully links 93% of 1,095,765 mention links with 82-91% precision, demonstrating mentions reveal more social connections than co-authorship data (average 5.3 individuals mentioned vs 1.3 co-authors).

  RELEVANCE: Methodologically important for studying philosophical communication patterns beyond formal citations. For literature reviews, this reveals that influence and relevance operate through multiple channels—not just who cites whom, but who mentions, discusses, and engages with whom. Literature reviewers implicitly make mention-based judgments (not just citation-based) about what to include.

This paper presents an alternative method involving the extracting and analysis of mentions to map and analyze links between scholars and texts in periods that fall outside the scope of citation-based studies. Focusing on one specific discipline in one particular period and language area—Anglophone philosophy between 1890 and 1979—we describe a procedure to create a mention index by identifying, extracting, and disambiguating mentions in academic publications. Our mention index includes 1,095,765 mention links, extracted from 22,977 articles published in 12 journals. We successfully link 93% of these mentions to specific philosophers, with an estimated precision of 82% to 91%. Moreover, we integrate the mention index into a database named EDHIPHY, which includes data and metadata from multiple sources and enables multidimensional mention analyses. In the final part of the paper, we present four case studies conducted by domain experts, demonstrating the use and the potential of both EDHIPHY and mention analyses more generally.},

 Citation metrics are statistical measures of scientific output that draw on citation indexes. They purport to capture the impact of scientific articles and the journals in which they appear. As evaluative tools, they are mostly used in the natural sciences, but they are also acquiring an important role in the humanities. While the strengths and weaknesses of citation metrics are extensively debated in a variety of fields, they have only recently started attracting attention in the philosophy of science literature. This paper takes a further step in this direction and presents an analysis of citation metrics from the perspective of a Kuhnian model for the development of science. Starting from Gillies’ argument against the use of citation metrics for scientific research (2008), this paper shows that citation metrics interfere with the development of normal science in certain fields or subfields. The main issue is that citation metrics do not take field-specific differences into account, thereby selectively favoring some fields and arbitrarily hindering the development of others. In other words, this paper shows that current citation metrics fail to “carve science at its joints”. In light of this, the paper cautions against their use for evaluative purposes.},

Philosophy employs network science as formal tool in social epistemology but considers network science results in causality/explanation debates.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how philosophers selectively engage with formal methods from other fields, relevant for understanding interdisciplinary literature review practices.

We use citation analysis to identify, among the articles published in Synthese and Philosophy of Science between 1985 and 2021, those that cite the specialistic literature in game theory and network science. Then, we investigate the structure of the two corpora thus identified by bibliographic coupling and divide them into clusters of related papers by automatic community detection. Lastly, we construct by the same bibliometric techniques a reference map of philosophy, on which we overlay our corpora to map the diffusion of game theory and network science in the various sub-areas of recent philosophy. Three main results derive from this study. (i) Philosophers are interested not only in using and investigating game theory as a formal method belonging to applied mathematics and sharing many relevant features with social choice theory, but also in considering its applications in more empirically oriented disciplines such as social psychology, cognitive science, or biology. (ii) Philosophers focus on networks in two research contexts and in two different ways: in the debate on causality and scientific explanation, they consider the results of network science; in social epistemology, they employ network science as a formal tool. (iii) In the reference map, logic—whose use in philosophy dates back to a much earlier period—is distributed in a more uniform way than recently encountered disciplines such as game theory and network science. We conclude by discussing some methodological limitations of our bibliometric approach, especially with reference to the problem of field delineation.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues prepublication peer review should be abolished and replaced with postpublication peer review, judging purely on epistemic grounds.

Changed incentive structures would alter social structure of science by reducing power of individual gatekeepers.

  RELEVANCE: Radical proposal with direct implications for what literature is available to review. If peer review shapes what gets published (and thus what can be reviewed), then critique of peer review is critique of the corpus available for literature reviews. The argument that gatekeeping excludes valuable work applies equally to literature reviews—reviewers face gatekeeping decisions about what to include. Postpublication review model suggests rethinking when and how evaluation occurs.

  RELEVANCE: Documents how gender biases shape not just what gets published but who submits work for publication, directly affecting the corpus available for literature reviews. If women submit less due to social biases, then literature reviews of published work will underrepresent women's philosophical contributions.

As part of the study 297 ethicists affiliated with top-ranking philosophy departments were identified and their journal publication information for the years 2010–2015 were recorded (1682 unique articles). The journal articles were then queried for through Google Scholar in order to establish open access status (web locations, document versions) of each publication record. Publication records belonging to the 20 most frequently used journal outlets (subset of 597 unique articles) were put under closer inspection with regards to alignment with publisher copyright restrictions as well as measuring unused potential to share articles. The results show that slightly over half of recent journal publications are available to read for free. PhilPapers and academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate) were found to be key platforms for research dissemination in ethics research. The representation of institutional repositories as providers of access was found to be weak, receiving the second lowest frequency rating among the eight discrete web location categories.

  RELEVANCE: Dramatic documentation of how language shapes what literature is available and considered relevant. If elite journals publish almost exclusively English-language citations, literature reviews in analytic philosophy will reproduce this bias by drawing on elite journals as sources.

Yet they remain excluded from canon, labeled as doing "bad" or "derivative" philosophy. These gatekeeping labels maintain canonical exclusion despite women's meeting standard criteria for inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how evaluative language functions as gatekeeping mechanism beyond formal publication barriers. Even women who publish in "top" venues face delegitimization through labels questioning quality or originality.

We also discuss two hypotheses: the supposed occurrence of a neuro-revolution in philosophy and the role of psychology as the disciplinary link between neuroscience and philosophy. Both the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and the visibility of philosophy in neuroscience have increased significantly from 1980 to 2020, albeit the latter remains an order of magnitude lower than the former. Neuroscience is particularly visible in philosophy of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of science, but not in ‘core’ areas of analytic philosophy. Philosophy is particularly visible in cognitive and systems neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, but not in biomedical neuroscience. As for the trading zone between philosophy and neuroscience, our data show that it works differently in philosophy and in neuroscience. While some philosophy journals are active loci of bidirectional communication, neuroscience journals are divided between journals ‘importing’ philosophy in neuroscience and journals ‘exporting’ neuroscience to philosophy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mainstream philosophy journals have implemented increasingly stringent peer review, probably attempting to prevent editorial decisions based on non-merit factors.

More stringent review concentrates power in hands of established scholars whose judgments may reflect mainstream biases.

We start by arguing, partly on the basis of the history of peer review in the journal Mind, that past and current peer review practices attest to partisanship with respect to philosophical approach (at least). Then, we explain that such partisanship conflicts with the standard aims of peer review, and that it is both epistemically and morally problematic. This assessment suggests that, if feasible, journals should treat all available and proposed standards of acceptance in philosophy as epistemically equal, and that philosophical work should be evaluated in terms of the novelty and significance of its contribution to developing thought in ways that are of value. Finally, we show, in a programmatic way, that improving the current situation is feasible, and can be done fairly easily.\u3c/p\u3},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Guenin develops a Kantian account of intellectual honesty as an
  exceptionless duty of nondeceptiveness in scholarly communication. Intellectual
  honesty requires not only avoiding false assertions but also refraining from
  deception through implicature, omission, equivocation, and sophistry that affect
  listeners' doxastic states. The kernel of intellectual honesty is a virtuous
  disposition such that when presented with an incentive to deceive, the agent will
  not deceive. For scholarship, this duty is exceptionless—there are no legitimate
  exceptions that would permit scholarly deception.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethics of omission in scholarship and provides
  the most rigorous philosophical account of intellectual honesty's demands.
  Guenin's analysis of deception through omission is crucial for evaluating whether
  selective literature engagement constitutes intellectual dishonesty. His claim
  that the duty is exceptionless in scholarship raises the question: does failing
  to engage with relevant literature constitute deception by omission? This provides
  a strong normative framework for literature review ethics.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller offers a preliminary account of intellectual honesty focused
  on its behavioral and motivational dimensions. The intellectually honest person
  reliably does not intentionally distort the facts as she takes them to be,
  motivated by intellectually virtuous reasons (truth-seeking, intellectual
  excellence, respect for others as epistemic agents). Miller distinguishes
  intellectual honesty from moral honesty and emphasizes that it involves both
  behavioral patterns (not distorting facts) and characteristic motivations (valuing
  truth and understanding).

  RELEVANCE: Provides a more recent and accessible account of intellectual honesty
  than Guenin, focusing on virtue rather than duty. Miller's emphasis on not
  intentionally distorting facts raises questions about how selective literature
  engagement relates to distortion—does omitting relevant work distort the
  scholarly record? His focus on motivation is important for understanding whether
  literature review practices reflect genuine commitment to truth or are driven by
  other motives (efficiency, confirmation bias, competitive advantage).

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account emphasizing behavioral dispositions and
  intellectually virtuous motivations; focuses on avoiding intentional distortion of
  facts.

  abstract = {Until recently, almost nothing had been written about the moral virtue of honesty in the past 50 years of Western analytic philosophy. Slowly, this is beginning to change. But moral honesty is not the only kind of honesty there is. In this paper, I focus specifically on the intellectual cousin to moral honesty, and offer a preliminary account of its behavioral and motivational dimensions. The account will be centered on not intentionally distorting the facts as the person takes them to be, for one of a variety of intellectually virtuous motivating reasons.},

  number = {2},
  pages = {410--428},
  doi = {10.1017/epi.2021.54},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Byerly examines the relationship between intellectual honesty (as
  developed by Nathan King adapting Christian Miller's work) and intellectual
  transparency (Byerly's own account). Intellectual transparency involves openly
  sharing one's intellectual states, processes, and limitations with others in ways
  that facilitate mutual understanding and epistemic cooperation. Byerly argues that
  intellectual transparency can be understood either as an exceptionally strong
  variety of intellectual honesty or as a distinct but related cardinal virtue.
  Transparency goes beyond honesty by requiring positive disclosure rather than
  merely avoiding deception.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between honesty and transparency is crucial for
  literature review ethics. While intellectual honesty might only prohibit
  misrepresenting what one has read, intellectual transparency would require
  disclosing what one has not read or what limitations exist in one's literature
  coverage. Byerly's account suggests that responsible scholarship may require not
  just avoiding deception but actively revealing gaps and limitations in one's
  knowledge. This has direct implications for how scholars should acknowledge the
  scope and boundaries of their literature reviews.

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account distinguishing intellectual honesty (avoiding
  deception) from intellectual transparency (positive disclosure); suggests
  transparency may be a more demanding virtue.

  abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of intellectually virtuous honesty, by examining the relationship between a recent account of intellectual honesty and a recent account of intellectual transparency. The account of intellectual honesty comes from Nathan King, who adapts the work of Christian Miller on moral honesty, while the account of intellectual transparency comes from T. Ryan Byerly. After introducing the respective accounts, I identify four potential differences between intellectual honesty and intellectual transparency as understood by these accounts. I then turn to the question of how to think about the relationship between these traits in light of these potential differences. I make the case that intellectual transparency can either be regarded as an exceptionally strong or ideal variety of intellectual honesty, or it can be regarded as a distinct virtue from intellectual honesty which is a more cardinal virtue than the latter. Along the way, I also note some places where a case can be made that Miller's and King's accounts of honesty and intellectual honesty are in need of refinement or clarification.},

  pages = {3501--3523},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-014-0418-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: King develops an account of intellectual perseverance as a virtue,
  distinct from but related to other intellectual virtues like conscientiousness,
  honesty, courage, and open-mindedness. Intellectual perseverance involves
  sustained engagement with difficult intellectual tasks despite obstacles,
  setbacks, and temptations to give up. King argues that intellectual perseverance
  is valuable both instrumentally (it helps achieve truth) and constitutively (it
  reflects proper valuation of intellectual goods).

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about honesty or integrity, King's analysis of
  intellectual perseverance connects to literature review ethics in important ways.
  Comprehensive literature engagement requires perseverance—the willingness to
  continue searching, reading, and synthesizing even when it becomes tedious or
  overwhelming. King's work suggests that virtuous scholarship involves not just
  avoiding dishonesty but also cultivating the stamina to pursue thorough
  understanding. This virtue-theoretic framework complements duty-based accounts by
  highlighting the dispositional qualities that enable responsible scholarship.

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account of intellectual perseverance as essential for
  sustained inquiry; complements other intellectual virtues in enabling good
  scholarship.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Baehr argues that intellectual virtues (including curiosity,
  open-mindedness, intellectual courage, intellectual honesty, and attentiveness)
  should be central aims of education. He distinguishes reliabilist conceptions of
  intellectual virtue (stable cognitive faculties) from responsibilist conceptions
  (character traits like the ones listed). Baehr advocates for the responsibilist
  approach and outlines how intellectual virtue education can be implemented in
  practice through modeling, direct instruction, and creating supportive
  institutional cultures.

  RELEVANCE: Baehr's work on intellectual virtue education provides a framework for
  understanding how scholarly norms and practices are transmitted through training
  and pedagogy. If intellectual virtues are cultivated through education and
  institutional culture, then research ethics in the humanities depends partly on
  how graduate programs and disciplinary communities socialize scholars. This
  connects to the project's questions about the role of training in shaping citation
  and review practices—are comprehensive literature reviews a matter of individual
  virtue, institutional norms, or both?

  POSITION: Responsibilist virtue epistemology applied to education; emphasizes
  character-based intellectual virtues and their pedagogical cultivation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kubota critiques epistemological racism—how racial inequalities
  shape knowledge production and consumption in academe, marginalizing scholarship
  by Global South scholars and women of color. Neoliberal academic competition
  compels scholars of color to become complicit with white Euro-American hegemonic
  knowledge, further perpetuating this hegemony. Kubota argues that epistemological
  antiracism requires validating alternative theories, rethinking citation practices,
  and developing critical reflexivity and accountability. Simply valorizing
  non-European knowledge risks essentialism and overlooking male hegemony; instead,
  black feminist ethics emphasizes personal ethical commitment to antiracism.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamentally challenges the assumption that literature review practices
  are neutral or purely epistemic. Kubota demonstrates how citation practices
  reproduce racial and gender hierarchies by privileging certain voices and
  marginalizing others. This raises critical questions for the project: Do norms of
  "comprehensive" literature review actually privilege Euro-American scholarship?
  How should scholars balance comprehensiveness with actively seeking out
  marginalized voices? Kubota suggests that responsible scholarship requires
  critical reflexivity about whose knowledge is cited and valued, not just formal
  completeness.

  POSITION: Critical/feminist epistemology analyzing how race and gender shape
  knowledge production; emphasizes structural barriers and need for antiracist
  citation practices.

 Recent scholarship in sociolinguistics and language education has examined how race and language intersect each other and how racism influences linguistic and educational practices. While racism is often conceptualized in terms of individual and institutional injustices, a critical examination of another form of racism—epistemological racism—problematizes how racial inequalities influence our knowledge production and consumption in academe. Highlighting the importance of the intersectional nature of identity categories, this conceptual article aims to draw scholars’ attention on how epistemological racism marginalizes and erases the knowledge produced by scholars in the Global South, women scholars of color, and other minoritized groups. In today’s neoliberal culture of competition, scholars of color are compelled to become complicit with white Euro-American hegemonic knowledge, further perpetuating the hegemony of white knowledge while marginalizing women scholars of color. Valorizing non-European knowledge and collectivity as an alternative framework also risks essentialism and male hegemony. Conversely, the ethics promoted by black feminism emphasizes a personal ethical commitment to antiracism. Epistemological antiracism invites scholars to validate alternative theories, rethink our citation practices, and develop critical reflexivity and accountability.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This collaborative essay examines how questions of who produces
  knowledge, what knowledge is produced, and how it is produced are inherently
  ethical and political, not merely technical. The authors argue that the ethical
  responsibility of academic knowledge production goes far beyond conventions around
  research integrity and extends to challenging systemic inequities, power
  structures, and dominant paradigms. They call for greater reflexivity about how
  journal editorial practices, citation networks, and theoretical frameworks shape
  what counts as legitimate knowledge and who counts as a legitimate knower.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethics of academic knowledge production at
  structural and institutional levels. The paper's emphasis on journal editing and
  publication practices connects to literature review ethics—what gets reviewed and
  cited is shaped by what gets published and legitimated. The authors' call for
  reflexivity about knowledge production aligns with the project's meta-philosophical
  inquiry into literature review methodology. Their critique suggests that ethical
  literature reviews must attend to power dynamics and not just epistemic
  comprehensiveness.

  POSITION: Critical/structural analysis of knowledge production ethics; emphasizes
  institutional power, editorial practices, and need for reflexivity about who
  produces knowledge.

  abstract = {To commemorate 40 years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme The Ethics and Politics of Academic Knowledge Production. Questions of who produces knowledge about what, and how that knowledge is produced, are inherent to editing and publishing academic journals. At the Journal of Business Ethics, we understand the ethical responsibility of academic knowledge production as going far beyond conventions around the integrity of the research content and research processes. We are deeply aware that access to resources, knowledge of the rules of the game, and being able to set those rules, are systematically and unequally distributed. One could ask the question “for whom is knowledge now ethical’”? (See the Burrell commentary.) We have a responsibility to address these inequalities and open up our journal to lesser heard voices, ideas, and ways of being. Our six commentators pursue this through various aspects of the ethics and politics of academic knowledge production. Working with MacIntyre’s scheme of practices and institutions, Andrew West provides commentary on the internal good of business ethics learning and education. Inviting us to step out of the cave, Christopher Michaelson urges a clear-eyed, unblinking focus on the purposes and audiences of business ethics scholarship. As developmental editor, Scott Taylor uncovers some of the politics of peer review with the aim of nurturing of unconventional research. Mike Hyman presents his idiosyncratic view of marketing ethics. In the penultimate commentary, Julie Nelson attributes difficulties in the academic positioning of the Business Ethics field to the hegemony of a masculine-centric model of the firm. And finally, Gibson Burrell provides a powerful provocation to go undercover as researcher-investigators in a parallel ethics of the research process.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Dougherty analyzes the concept of the scholarly record and how it
  should be corrected when research integrity violations occur. He argues that the
  humanities have fallen short compared to natural sciences in ensuring the
  integrity of the published record. The scholarly record includes not just
  publications but also the web of citations, attributions, and knowledge claims that
  constitute disciplinary knowledge. Dougherty develops frameworks for understanding
  what counts as part of the scholarly record and what methods (retraction,
  correction, commentary) are appropriate for maintaining its integrity.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on plagiarism and misconduct, Dougherty's analysis of the
  scholarly record has implications for literature review ethics. If the scholarly
  record includes not just individual publications but the network of citations and
  knowledge claims, then selective literature engagement potentially distorts this
  record by breaking connections or omitting relevant work. Dougherty's emphasis on
  correcting the record also raises questions about what obligations scholars have
  when they discover their own literature reviews were incomplete or biased.

  POSITION: Research integrity framework focused on maintaining the reliability of
  the scholarly record; emphasizes need for humanities disciplines to develop better
  integrity mechanisms.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Khamitov develops a philosophical anthropology of academic integrity
  that goes beyond rule-following to examine it as a will or existential commitment.
  Drawing on meta-anthropology, he argues that academic integrity becomes
  unconditional only when driven by the will to knowledge, creativity, and
  co-creation, not merely the will to power or self-preservation. True academic
  integrity requires genuine academic dialogue and cannot exist as a simulacrum of
  rule-compliance. Khamitov examines how this understanding applies during war and
  peace, connecting academic integrity to broader questions of human existence and
  responsibility.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a deeper philosophical anthropology of what academic integrity
  means beyond procedural compliance. Khamitov's emphasis on academic integrity as
  requiring genuine dialogue and will to knowledge (not just power) offers a
  framework for evaluating whether literature review practices reflect authentic
  scholarly engagement or merely strategic positioning. His work suggests that
  responsible scholarship requires not just following norms but cultivating the right
  kind of will and orientation toward knowledge.

  POSITION: Philosophical anthropology/existential approach to academic integrity;
  emphasizes will, dialogue, and authenticity beyond rule-following.

  abstract = {Academic integrity in education and science is understood as an ability that translates from possible into actual justice in the relations of students, teachers and scientists, their respect for their own dignity and the dignity of colleagues, as well as a focus on sincere creativity and co-creation. Academic integrity is the ability to maintain and develop the reputation of a conscientious, tolerant and creative professional who does not envy the talent of colleagues and does not appropriate their achievements. In the article, academic integrity appears not only as a demand and a challenge, but also as a will. In the coordinates of the methodology of meta-anthropology, it is proven that at the level of the will to self-preservation and procreation, as well as at the level of the will to power, any virtue, including academic and conditional, moreover, its deformations and distortions are possible. Only under the influence of the will to knowledge and creativity of the finite being of a person, which is supplemented by the will to co-creation in the meta-boundary being, academic integrity acquires an unconditional character and naturalness. It has been proven that true academic integrity is impossible without true academic dialogue, without it it turns into a simulacrum. The heuristic meaning of the concept “will to academic integrity” is substantiated. The will to academic integrity is an important component of the will to scientific novelty and actualizes academic writing that has heuristic achievements, is free from plagiarism, does not amount to compilation and is not a fabrication. As an example of the action of such a will in the academic community, the Kyiv anthropological school is presented in its development in the directions of existential anthropology and metaanthropology. The role of academic integrity in conditions of war and peace is shown.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Building on Foucault, anarchist theory, and anti-racist feminist
  scholarship, Luchies argues that academic knowledge production in social movement
  research is embedded in exploitative and hierarchical power relations. He proposes
  three ethics to counter this: movement-relevant research (confronting extractive
  knowledge-making), anti-oppressive practice (resisting neutral and disinterested
  postures), and prefigurative methods (modeling non-hierarchical authority). These
  ethics together facilitate an "insurrection of knowledges" that challenges the
  regime of truth underlying academic research.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on social movement research, Luchies' critique of
  extractive and hierarchical knowledge production applies to literature review
  practices. His emphasis on movement-relevance raises questions about who benefits
  from scholarly literature reviews and whose interests they serve. The
  anti-oppressive and prefigurative ethics suggest that responsible scholarship
  requires interrogating power relations not just in fieldwork but in how scholars
  engage with and represent others' intellectual work. This challenges individualistic
  virtue approaches by foregrounding systemic power.

  abstract = {Despite ongoing efforts to articulate radical methods and theoretical frameworks for social movement research, the field remains embedded in exploitative, oppressive, and hierarchical modes of knowledge production. Following Foucault, I argue that this is because societies like ours, founded through racial and patriarchal violence, are invested in a regime of truth supportive of that violence. In light of this, I argue that social movements scholars need to adopt a radically different form of knowledge practice. Building on anarchist, anti-racist feminist, and anti-colonial scholarship, this paper begins by analysing how liberalism constrains social justice organizing and how academic norms foreclose accountable social movements scholarship. I then introduce three unique ethics emerging in resistance to this situation: movement-relevant, anti-oppressive, and prefigurative. The first confronts the extractive imperatives of enlightenment truth-making; the second resists its neutral and disinterested tendencies; and the third models a rejection of its hierarchical and exclusive mode of authority. I argue that together they provide scholars with a strategy for re-/orienting their research towards what Foucault theorizes as an insurrection of knowledges. These three ethical frameworks combine to facilitate an insurrectionary power/knowledge that fosters collective struggle as it progressively dismantles the regime of truth underlying social movements research.},
