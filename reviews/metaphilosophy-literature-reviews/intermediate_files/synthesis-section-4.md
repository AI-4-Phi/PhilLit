## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals a landscape in which extensive philosophical resources -- from metaphilosophy to epistemic justice to hermeneutic theory -- bear directly on the practice of literature reviewing, yet have never been systematically brought together for this purpose. Four specific lacunae emerge, each grounded in the evidence surveyed above.

### Gap 1: No Explicit Methodology for Philosophical Literature Reviews

The most striking finding of this review is an absence. While Grant and Booth (2009) identify fourteen distinct review types and Arksey and O'Malley (2005) develop a scoping review framework, both emerge from health and social science contexts premised on empirical evidence synthesis. Philosophy has produced no comparable methodological literature for its own review practices. The metaphilosophy literature theorizes philosophical method extensively -- Williamson (2007) defends philosophy's continuity with science, Cappelen, Gendler, and Hawthorne (2016) document its irreducible methodological pluralism, and D'Oro and Overgaard (2017) show how different traditions embed different metaphilosophical commitments -- yet none of these works addresses the literature review as a distinct methodological practice requiring its own theorization.

This absence matters because it means that the norms governing philosophical literature reviews are transmitted tacitly through graduate training and disciplinary socialization rather than subjected to explicit critical examination. As Nado (2017) argues, responsible methodological reflection requires both descriptive understanding of actual practices and normative evaluation of their justification. Without explicit methodology, philosophical review practices remain resistant to the very kind of scrutiny that philosophy demands of other intellectual activities -- a paradox for a discipline defined by self-examination.

### Gap 2: No Integration of Justice Frameworks with Review Methodology

The epistemic injustice literature and the literature on review methodology develop in near-complete isolation from one another. Fricker's (2007) framework of testimonial and hermeneutical injustice has generated a vast body of work applying these concepts to testimony, credibility, and knowledge production broadly. Dotson (2014) expands the framework to structural dimensions through the concept of epistemic oppression. Dadze-Arthur and Mangai (2024) explicitly identify citational justice as a facet of testimonial justice. Yet almost none of this work addresses the specific practice of the literature review -- the scholarly genre in which citational choices are most concentrated and consequential.

Similarly, the canon formation literature documents in rich detail how exclusionary mechanisms -- racist historiography (Graness 2018), evaluative gatekeeping labels (Connell and Janssen-Lauret 2016), colonial epistemicide (Dhawan 2017) -- shape what counts as "the philosophical literature." But this body of work does not connect its findings to the methodology of literature reviewing. The hermeneutic literature on charitable interpretation, including Lockard's (2023) incisive analysis of the "charitability gap," critiques interpretive norms without developing their implications for how scholars should construct literature syntheses.

The result is that literature reviews remain a practice where ethical failures go undiagnosed as such. When a reviewer systematically excludes non-Anglophone work -- a pattern documented by Contesi, Chapman, and Sandis (2019), who found that 97% of citations in elite analytic journals are to English-language sources -- this is treated as a matter of scope rather than a potential injustice. Integrating justice frameworks with review methodology would make such patterns visible as ethical concerns, not merely practical limitations.

### Gap 3: No Account of What Makes a Literature Review Ethically Bad

While the research ethics literature develops accounts of intellectual honesty (Miller 2022) and intellectual transparency (Byerly 2022), these accounts focus on individual scholarly virtues without applying them specifically to literature reviews. Kubota (2019) critiques epistemological racism in knowledge production, and Burrell et al. (2022) call for reflexivity about who produces knowledge and how, but both address research conduct broadly rather than literature synthesis in particular. Lockard (2023) identifies the charitability gap as a mechanism of epistemic oppression but does not develop a comprehensive account of interpretive ethics for the review genre.

A normative account of what makes a literature review ethically deficient is needed -- one that distinguishes failures of inclusion (citational injustice through systematic omission), failures of representation (interpretive injustice through biased or uncharitable engagement with included work), and failures of transparency (intellectual dishonesty about scope, limitations, and the reviewer's own positioning). Each failure type draws on existing conceptual resources but has not been articulated as such in the literature.

### Gap 4: No Empirical Investigation of Philosophical Review Practices

The sociology of philosophy provides rich data on the structural conditions shaping philosophical knowledge production. Petrovich et al. (2024) pioneer mention extraction methods revealing influence networks beyond formal citation. Contesi, Chapman, and Sandis (2019) document language bias. De Bruin (2023) maps journal prestige hierarchies. Leuschner (2019) identifies gendered submission patterns as indirect effects of social bias. Yet no empirical study examines how philosophical literature reviews themselves are actually constructed -- what search strategies philosophers employ, how they determine scope, what factors (prestige, accessibility, personal networks, language) influence inclusion decisions.

Without this empirical baseline, normative prescriptions risk being disconnected from actual scholarly practice. As Nado (2017) insists, methodological reflection requires both descriptive and normative components. The sociological work provides structural context -- documenting the conditions under which reviews are produced -- but the practice itself remains a black box. This gap represents a priority for future research, and the available bibliometric data can ground normative claims even as it highlights the need for more targeted empirical investigation.

### Synthesis

These four gaps are not independent; they form an interlocking structure. The absence of explicit methodology (Gap 1) makes it difficult to identify ethical failures (Gap 3), because there are no standards against which to measure. The separation of justice frameworks from review methodology (Gap 2) means that even well-intentioned reviewers lack conceptual tools for recognizing how their practices may enact epistemic injustice. And the absence of empirical data on actual review practices (Gap 4) means that both methodological proposals and ethical critiques proceed without grounding in how philosophers actually work.

## Conclusion

This review has shown that the philosophical literature review is a practice simultaneously ubiquitous and unexamined. Philosophy's relentless self-scrutiny -- its insistence on interrogating its own concepts, methods, and presuppositions -- has not extended to one of its most basic scholarly genres.

Three key findings emerge from the literatures surveyed. First, there is no settled methodology for philosophical literature reviews because the underlying metaphilosophical questions remain deeply contested. If philosophy is continuous with science (Williamson 2007), literature reviews should track cumulative progress in the manner of scientific reviews. If philosophical methodology is irreducibly plural (Cappelen, Gendler, and Hawthorne 2016; D'Oro and Overgaard 2017), then different subfields may require fundamentally different review approaches. If the very question "what counts as philosophy?" is politically contested (Denecke 2024), then defining the scope of a review is already an ethically freighted decision. The hermeneutic dimension adds further complexity: representing others' views faithfully requires interpretive judgment that is itself subject to the charitability gap Lockard (2023) identifies, and to the paradox of charity that Lewinski (2012) diagnoses in multi-party disputes.

Second, literature reviews are ethically consequential. They enact epistemic justice or injustice through citational choices (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2014; Dadze-Arthur and Mangai 2024), reproduce or contest canons constructed through exclusion (Graness 2018; Connell and Janssen-Lauret 2016), and operate within social structures that systematically advantage some voices while marginalizing others (Contesi, Chapman, and Sandis 2019; Leuschner 2019; Petrovich et al. 2024). These ethical dimensions are not incidental to the literature review but constitutive of it.

Third, existing literatures provide rich but fragmented resources for addressing these questions. Virtue epistemology offers accounts of intellectual honesty and transparency (Miller 2022; Byerly 2022). Structural critique exposes mechanisms of exclusion from epistemological racism to epistemicide (Kubota 2019; Grosfoguel 2013). Hermeneutic theory illuminates the paradoxes and politics of charitable interpretation (Davidson 2001; Lockard 2023). But these resources have not been integrated into a unified account of what makes a philosophical literature review good -- methodologically sound, interpretively fair, and ethically responsible.

The research project this review supports fills a genuine gap by bringing these disparate literatures into conversation. This matters beyond academic methodology. If literature reviews shape what counts as "the state of the art," determine which questions are taken to be open, and distribute epistemic recognition among scholars, then getting them right is not merely a matter of scholarly convenience but of epistemic justice.
