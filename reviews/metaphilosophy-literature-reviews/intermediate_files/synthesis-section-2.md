## The Methodological Landscape -- Competing Conceptions of Philosophical Literature Engagement

There is no settled methodology for conducting literature reviews in philosophy. While adjacent disciplines have developed explicit, replicable frameworks for surveying and synthesizing prior research, philosophy has produced almost nothing of the kind. This absence is not accidental. It reflects a deeper problem: the question of how to review philosophical literature is parasitic on the contested question of what philosophy is and how it proceeds. Different metaphilosophical commitments -- about the nature of philosophical evidence, the possibility of philosophical progress, and the boundaries of the discipline -- yield fundamentally different conceptions of what a literature review should accomplish. To these methodological questions, the hermeneutic dimension of philosophical engagement adds a further layer of complexity: a literature review does not merely catalogue positions but interprets and represents them, and interpretation is itself an ethically fraught practice.

### The Missing Genre -- Philosophy's Unreflective Review Practice

The methodological literature on research synthesis is extensive -- but almost entirely outside philosophy. Grant and Booth (2009) provide a widely cited typology of fourteen distinct review types, from systematic reviews to meta-analyses to critical reviews, analyzed through their SALSA framework (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis, Analysis). This taxonomy offers a structural vocabulary for describing what reviews do and how they differ. Arksey and O'Malley (2005) develop a complementary framework for scoping reviews, emphasizing the mapping of key concepts, the identification of gaps, and the iterative clarification of research questions -- aims that arguably align more naturally with philosophical inquiry than the hypothesis-testing orientation of systematic reviews. Yet both frameworks assume an empirical research paradigm in which "evidence" consists of data gathered through replicable methods and "quality appraisal" involves assessing methodological rigor in a relatively standardized sense.

Philosophy proceeds differently. Its primary modes are conceptual analysis, normative argument, and critical interpretation, not data collection. Philosophical "evidence" -- if the term even applies -- includes intuitions, thought experiments, historical texts, and logical entailments. The translation problem here is fundamental, not incidental: one cannot simply adapt a systematic review protocol designed for randomized controlled trials to a field where the central question may be whether a concept is coherent rather than whether an intervention is effective.

The most telling evidence for philosophy's methodological gap is the sheer scarcity of literature addressing it. A systematic search for work explicitly theorizing the methodology of philosophical literature reviews yielded only a handful of papers, none of which develops a dedicated framework for philosophical contexts. This silence is itself a finding. It reveals that philosophers treat literature engagement as tacit knowledge -- a skill absorbed through graduate training and imitation rather than a methodological problem requiring explicit theorization. As Shan (2022) argues, examining philosophy's own methods and assumptions is essential to responsible philosophical practice; yet the literature review, one of philosophy's most ubiquitous scholarly practices, has escaped this self-scrutiny.

### Metaphilosophical Foundations -- What Philosophy Is Determines How to Review Its Literature

The absence of explicit review methodology in philosophy is not simply a lacuna waiting to be filled by importing frameworks from elsewhere. It reflects the fact that the prior question -- what philosophy is and how it works -- remains deeply contested, and different answers to that question imply different models for what a good literature review looks like.

Williamson (2007) offers the most influential contemporary defense of naturalistic anti-exceptionalism: philosophy is continuous with science, employing broadly abductive methods to seek the best explanations of all available evidence. If this view is correct, philosophical literature reviews should function analogously to scientific reviews -- surveying competing theories, assessing evidence for and against them, and tracking cumulative progress. The implication is that philosophical literature constitutes a body of knowledge that grows over time, and reviews should chart that growth.

Against this, the contributors to D'Oro and Overgaard's (2017) Cambridge Companion emphasize that methodological choices in philosophy are theory-laden, reflecting deeper metaphilosophical commitments rather than neutral procedural decisions. A phenomenologist's literature review will differ fundamentally from an experimental philosopher's, not because they survey different papers but because they disagree about what constitutes evidence, what counts as progress, and what the relevant literature even is. The Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodology (Cappelen, Gendler, and Hawthorne 2016) reinforces this point through sheer variety: conceptual analysis, formal methods, experimental philosophy, and phenomenological approaches each imply different relationships to existing work. The Handbook's pluralism about method suggests that there may be no single correct way to conduct a philosophical literature review -- the review's form must be responsive to the methodological commitments of the inquiry it serves.

Lewin (2021) deepens this picture historically by reconstructing Kant's metaphilosophy, in which philosophy is understood both as a distinctive rational activity and as an architectonic system. The Kantian distinction between philosophy as activity and philosophy as system suggests that engaging with the literature is not merely a preliminary step -- a survey conducted before the real philosophical work begins -- but is itself constitutive of philosophical inquiry. One reviews literature not to clear the ground but to participate in a tradition of reasoned investigation. This implies that literature reviews should be understood as philosophical acts in their own right, not as pre-philosophical housekeeping.

Denecke (2024) exposes a further dimension that Williamson's naturalism and Lewin's Kantianism alike leave underexplored: the politics of the question "what counts as philosophical literature?" She argues that current efforts to globalize academic philosophy are deadlocked because they operate within Western metaphilosophical assumptions about what philosophy is. Four problematic diversity paradigms -- "The Same," "The Subaltern," "The Samaritan," and "The Area Studies Silo" -- each fail to achieve genuine pluralism because they take Western philosophy as the default against which other traditions are measured. If Denecke is right, then the seemingly neutral methodological question of which literatures to include in a review already encodes exclusionary assumptions about whose thought qualifies as philosophy. No review methodology can be adequate that does not confront this problem.

As Nado (2017) argues in a meta-methodological register, prescriptive methodologies for philosophical practice cannot be developed independently of examining how that practice actually functions -- but descriptive accounts alone do not vindicate existing practices. Both empirical investigation and normative reflection are needed. This insight applies directly to literature reviews: understanding what philosophers currently do when they review literature is necessary but insufficient for determining what they should do. The absence of any empirical study of actual philosophical review practices makes the normative task harder still.

### The Hermeneutic Dimension -- Reading, Representing, and the Ethics of Interpretation

A philosophical literature review does not merely list works or tabulate results; it interprets and represents the positions it surveys. This interpretive dimension distinguishes philosophical reviews from their empirical counterparts and introduces ethical complexity that standard review methodologies do not address.

The principle of charity provides the canonical starting point. Davidson (2001) argues that charitable interpretation -- attributing largely true beliefs and rational coherence to those we interpret -- is not merely advisable but constitutive of understanding itself. On this view, massive error cannot be coherently attributed to a speaker, because the conditions for interpretation require substantial agreement between interpreter and interpreted. Applied to literature reviews, this would mean that reviewers must by default attribute rationality and coherence to the positions they survey, reconstructing them in their strongest form before assessing their limitations.

Yet the application of charity is more contested than Davidson's constitutive account suggests. Vandevelde (2021) argues that charity is both an epistemic and a moral virtue, not a mechanical principle. Drawing on Gregory the Great's sixth-century hermeneutics, Vandevelde contends that representing others' views requires moral qualities of the interpreter -- an orientation toward the good in the text -- not just technical skill in reconstruction. Similarly, De Caro and Vaccarezza (2020) develop a "principle of phronetic charity" that integrates Aristotelian practical wisdom with interpretive practice. On their account, charity is context-sensitive: good interpretation requires judgment about when and how to apply charitable reading, not invariant rule-following.

These refinements of charity leave its fundamental orientation intact: interpret generously. But Lewinski (2012) identifies a structural paradox that destabilizes even this orientation. In any multi-party dispute, being charitable to one side often requires being uncharitable to the other, since the parties disagree. A literature review synthesizing competing positions faces this paradox acutely. If one reconstructs the compatibilist's argument in its strongest form, one may thereby make the incompatibilist's objections appear weaker, and vice versa. Neutral charitable representation of all parties may be impossible in principle, not merely difficult in practice.

The most searching challenge to interpretive charity comes from Lockard (2023), who identifies a "charitability gap" in academic philosophy. Lockard argues that charitable interpretation is selectively applied: generously extended to canonical (often white, male) authors, even when they espouse racist or sexist views, while withheld from the work of marginalized scholars. This selective deployment means that charity, far from being a neutral interpretive virtue, can function as a mechanism of epistemic oppression -- creating conditions for testimonial smothering, serving as an "orientation device" that enforces disciplinary conformity, and requiring resistant philosophers to remain in oppressive interpretive worlds. Lockard does not advocate abandoning charity entirely, but her analysis demonstrates that interpretive norms operate within power structures and cannot be assessed in abstraction from them.

The connection between hermeneutic theory and the specific practice of writing literature reviews remains almost entirely implicit in the existing scholarship. Yet the stakes are considerable. If literature reviews are interpretive acts -- and they are -- then the norms governing interpretation directly shape whose work is represented fairly, whose positions are reconstructed charitably, and whose contributions are rendered invisible through ungenerous reading. Lockard's critique raises the question of whether the interpretive norms that guide literature reviews need not merely to be applied more consistently but to be fundamentally rethought in light of the structural inequities that shape scholarly practice.
