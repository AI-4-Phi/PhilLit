DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses a significant gap in the literature: explicit theorizing about what literature reviews are, what they are for, and how they should be conducted in philosophy and the humanities. Unlike the natural and social sciences, which have developed extensive methodological literature on systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and meta-analyses, philosophy and the humanities lack dedicated frameworks for conducting and evaluating literature reviews as a scholarly genre.

The available literature falls into three clusters: (1) methodological frameworks from adjacent fields (health information science, social research) that have been influential but not systematically adapted to humanities contexts; (2) metaphilosophical works that address the nature and methods of philosophy itself, which implicitly bear on how philosophers should survey and synthesize existing work; and (3) emerging discussions of philosophical methodology that occasionally touch on review practices without making them central.

Grant and Booth's typology of review types and Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, though developed for health and social research, have become reference points for humanities scholars seeking structured approaches. However, these frameworks assume empirical research paradigms and evidence-based methodologies that do not straightforwardly translate to philosophical inquiry, which proceeds primarily through conceptual analysis, normative argument, and critical interpretation rather than empirical data collection.

The metaphilosophical literature (Williamson, Thomasson, D'Oro & Overgaard, Cappelen et al.) addresses fundamental questions about philosophical methods but does not explicitly theorize the literature review as a distinct methodological practice. These works establish the contested nature of philosophical methodology itself—whether philosophy is continuous with science, whether it has distinctive methods, what role intuitions and conceptual analysis play—questions that shape but do not determine how philosophers should approach surveying and synthesizing existing literature.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to the research project's attempt to develop a methodology for literature reviews in philosophy. The scarcity of direct literature on this topic is itself a significant finding: it reveals that philosophers have not typically treated literature review as a methodological problem requiring explicit theorization. The project thus enters relatively uncharted territory, with the opportunity to draw selectively from adjacent fields while remaining sensitive to the distinctive features of philosophical inquiry.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
There is almost no literature explicitly addressing the genre of the philosophical literature review, the philosophical survey article, or the state-of-the-art review in philosophy. No works were found that systematically compare review methodologies across disciplines or that develop criteria for evaluating the quality of philosophical literature reviews. The epistemology of literature reviews—how surveying existing work generates new knowledge—remains largely implicit in philosophical practice.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should acknowledge the domain's sparseness and frame this as both a challenge and an opportunity. It should carefully distinguish methodological frameworks developed for empirical research from those potentially applicable to philosophy, and it should extract implicit methodological commitments from metaphilosophical works. The project may need to rely more heavily on inference from practice (how literature reviews actually function in philosophy) than on explicit methodological prescription.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Evidence-based review frameworks (2 papers): Grant & Booth, Arksey & O'Malley - systematic and scoping review methodologies from health/social sciences
- Metaphilosophical positions on philosophical method (4 papers): Williamson, Thomasson, two Companions/Handbooks - diverse views on nature of philosophy and its methods, with implications for how philosophical literature should be surveyed and synthesized

  CORE ARGUMENT: Grant and Booth provide a systematic typology of 14 distinct review types (including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-analyses, critical reviews, and literature reviews) and analyze their associated methodologies using the SALSA framework (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis, and Analysis). They clarify the defining characteristics, purposes, and methodological requirements of each review type, addressing widespread confusion about review terminology and methodology.

  RELEVANCE: Though developed for health information science, this typology has become a foundational reference across disciplines seeking structured approaches to literature synthesis. For the present project, it provides a baseline taxonomy of review types against which to assess whether and how these categories apply to philosophical inquiry. The SALSA framework offers a potential starting point for analyzing philosophical review methodology, though the paper's assumption of evidence-based empirical research raises questions about translation to conceptual and normative domains.

  POSITION: Evidence-based research synthesis. Assumes reviews aim to synthesize empirical evidence according to explicit, replicable protocols. Emphasizes transparency, systematic search strategies, and quality appraisal of primary studies—features that may or may not straightforwardly apply to philosophical literature reviews.

  abstract = {Abstract Background and objectives: The expansion of evidence‐based practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework—Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA)—was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain.},

  title = {Scoping studies: towards a methodological framework},
  journal = {International Journal of Social Research Methodology},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {8},

  pages = {19--32},
  doi = {10.1080/1364557032000119616},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arksey and O'Malley propose a six-stage methodological framework for scoping reviews: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results; and (6) consultation with stakeholders. They distinguish scoping reviews from systematic reviews, emphasizing that scoping studies aim to map key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in a research area rather than to answer narrow research questions through synthesis of empirical evidence.

  RELEVANCE: The scoping review framework is highly relevant to philosophical literature review methodology because scoping reviews' broader, exploratory aims—mapping a field, identifying gaps, clarifying concepts—align more closely with typical aims of philosophical surveys than do the narrowly focused questions of systematic reviews. This paper provides a structured methodology that may translate more readily to philosophy than systematic review protocols, though questions remain about how "evidence" should be understood in philosophical contexts.

  POSITION: Flexible evidence mapping approach. Distinguishes scoping reviews as exploratory and concept-mapping exercises rather than hypothesis-testing syntheses. Emphasizes breadth over depth and allows for iterative refinement of research questions—features that may suit philosophical inquiry's conceptual and argumentative character.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on scoping studies, an approach to reviewing the literature which to date has received little attention in the research methods literature. We distinguish between different types of scoping studies and indicate where these stand in relation to full systematic reviews. We outline a framework for conducting a scoping study based on our recent experiences of reviewing the literature on services for carers for people with mental health problems. Where appropriate, our approach to scoping the field is contrasted with the procedures followed in systematic reviews. We emphasize how including a consultation exercise in this sort of study may enhance the results, making them more useful to policy makers, practitioners and service users. Finally, we consider the advantages and limitations of the approach and suggest that a wider debate is called for about the role of the scoping study in relation to other types of literature reviews.},

@book{williamson2007philosophy,
  author = {Williamson, Timothy},
  title = {The Philosophy of Philosophy},

  doi = {10.1002/9780470696675},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Williamson argues against dominant 20th-century views that would reduce philosophy to linguistic analysis, conceptual analysis, or culturally relative inquiry. He defends a robustly realist conception of philosophy as continuous with other forms of inquiry, particularly with science, employing a broadly abductive methodology that seeks the best explanations of all the evidence (including evidence from thought experiments, intuitions, and reflection). Philosophy, on this view, aims at knowledge of objective, mind-independent reality, and philosophical method is not fundamentally distinct from scientific method.

  RELEVANCE: Williamson's defense of philosophical methodology has significant implications for how literature reviews in philosophy should be conceived. If philosophy is continuous with science and employs broadly abductive methods, then literature reviews might function similarly to reviews in empirical sciences—surveying evidence, assessing competing explanatory theories, identifying unsolved problems. However, if philosophical "evidence" includes intuitions, conceptual considerations, and thought experiments, the criteria for appraising and synthesizing this evidence will differ from empirical research, raising questions about what a "systematic" philosophical review would involve.

  POSITION: Methodological continuity between philosophy and science. Rejects linguistic turn and defends philosophy as knowledge-seeking enterprise with methods continuous with (though not identical to) scientific inquiry. Implies literature reviews should survey philosophical "evidence" and assess competing theories, though details of how this works remain to be specified.

Williamson takes the first-order view and prefers the term "the philosophy of philosophy" to "metaphilosophy," believing that "metaphilosophy" connotes a second-order perspective that "looks down upon philosophy from above, or beyond"—a connotation he rejects.},

@book{doroovergaard2017cambridge,
  editor = {D'Oro, Giuseppina and Overgaard, Søren},
  title = {The Cambridge Companion to Philosophical Methodology},
  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/9781316344118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited collection brings together essays on diverse approaches to philosophical methodology, spanning analytic and continental traditions. Contributors address conceptual analysis, phenomenological method, experimental philosophy, naturalism, pragmatism, and other methodological orientations. The volume as a whole resists offering a unified account of philosophical method, instead presenting philosophical methodology as pluralistic and contested terrain where different traditions and approaches operate with distinct aims, standards, and procedures.

  RELEVANCE: The Companion's pluralistic approach to philosophical methodology is directly relevant to theorizing literature reviews in philosophy. If there is no single philosophical method but rather a family of methods reflecting different traditions and aims, then there may be no single correct way to conduct philosophical literature reviews. The volume provides resources for understanding how different methodological orientations might shape review practices—how a phenomenologist's literature review might differ from an experimental philosopher's, for instance, or how different conceptions of evidence and justification affect what counts as adequate coverage of a field.

  POSITION: Methodological pluralism in philosophy. Rejects the idea of a single philosophical method in favor of recognizing diverse, tradition-relative methodological approaches. Implies that literature review methodology in philosophy may itself need to be pluralistic, reflecting diverse aims and standards across philosophical subdisciplines and traditions.

They explore general conceptions of philosophy, centred on the question of what the point of philosophising might be; the method of conceptual analysis and its recent naturalistic critics and competitors; perspectives from continental philosophy; and also a variety of methodological views that belong neither to the mainstream of analytic philosophy, nor to continental philosophy as commonly conceived. Together they will enable readers to grasp an unusually wide range of approaches to methodological debates in philosophy.},

  title = {The Oxford Handbook of Philosophical Methodology},

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive handbook surveys the landscape of contemporary philosophical methodology through contributions from leading philosophers. Topics include the role of intuitions in philosophy, experimental philosophy, conceptual analysis, thought experiments, formal methods, naturalism, a priori knowledge, and the relationship between philosophy and science. The volume does not advocate a single methodological position but provides critical surveys of major debates and approaches, reflecting the contested and evolving nature of philosophical method in contemporary analytic philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: The Handbook provides essential background for understanding the methodological context in which philosophical literature reviews operate. Different views on philosophical method—whether philosophy relies on a priori intuitions or empirical evidence, whether it employs distinctive conceptual analysis or methods continuous with science—have implications for how philosophical literature should be surveyed and synthesized. A literature review synthesizing work on intuitions, for instance, faces different methodological questions than one synthesizing work on empirical moral psychology. The volume's breadth makes it a key reference for situating literature review methodology within broader metaphilosophical debates.

  POSITION: Comprehensive survey of methodological positions in contemporary analytic philosophy. Presents ongoing debates without endorsing a unified view. Useful primarily as a resource for understanding the diversity of methodological commitments that shape philosophical inquiry and, by extension, may shape philosophical literature review practices.

It considers a number of hypotheses that explain the nature of philosophical methodology, including eliminativism, epistemologism, theory selectionism, necessary preconditionalism, and hierarchicalism. It also tackles a range of topics such as ‘ordinary language philosophy’, the role of logic in philosophical methodology, phenomenology, philosophical heuristics, and methods in the philosophy of literature and film. Other chapters discuss the method of reflective equilibrium, the notions of conceivability and possibility, naturalistic approaches to philosophical methodology, the methodology of legal philosophy, aesthetics and the philosophy of art as branches of analytic philosophy, issues and methods in the philosophy of mathematics, how and whether faith conflicts with reason, and critical philosophy of race.},

@book{thomasson2015ontology,
  author = {Thomasson, Amie L.},
  title = {Ontology Made Easy},
  year = {2014},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199385119.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Thomasson defends "easy ontology," arguing that many traditional metaphysical disputes about what exists (numbers, properties, social objects, etc.) can be resolved through straightforward conceptual and empirical inferences rather than through deep metaphysical theorizing. Ontological questions are "easy" when they can be answered by combining semantic competence with relevant empirical information. This approach deflates many metaphysical debates, suggesting that philosophers have often mistaken conceptual or semantic questions for substantive questions about the world's fundamental structure.

  RELEVANCE: Though not explicitly about review methodology, Thomasson's easy ontology has significant implications for how philosophical literature should be surveyed and assessed. If many philosophical debates rest on conceptual confusions or category mistakes rather than genuine disagreements about reality, then literature reviews must include a diagnostic component—identifying which debates are substantive and which rest on pseudo-questions. This affects how gaps in the literature are understood: an apparent gap may reflect not an unsolved problem but a dissolved pseudo-problem. Thomasson's work exemplifies a methodological orientation (neo-Carnapian deflationism) that would shape literature review practices differently than, say, naturalistic metaphysics.

  POSITION: Deflationary/easy ontology. Rejects the idea that ontology involves discovering the deep structure of reality in favor of view that ontological questions are typically answerable through conceptual analysis plus empirical input. Implies that literature reviews in metaphysics should identify which debates are substantive versus merely verbal or conceptual.

  keywords = {metaphilosophy, ontology, deflationism, Medium},
  abstract = {This volume aims to develop the easy approach to ontology, showing how it leads to both a first-order simple realism about the disputed entities and a form of metaontological deflationism that takes ontological disputes themselves to be misguided, since existence questions may be answered by straightforward conceptual and/or empirical work. It also aims to defend the easy approach against a range of objections and to show it to be a viable and attractive alternative to hard ontology.},
