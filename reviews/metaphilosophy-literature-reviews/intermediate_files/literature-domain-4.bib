====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines the formation, maintenance, and contestation of the
philosophical canon—the set of texts, authors, and traditions recognized as
"philosophy proper" within academic institutions. The literature reveals that
canon formation is not a neutral process of recognizing intrinsic philosophical
merit, but rather a political and epistemic practice shaped by structures of
power, including racism, sexism, colonialism, and Eurocentrism.

The field is structured around three interconnected debates. First, historical
studies trace how the modern Western canon was actively constructed through
exclusionary practices. Peter K.J. Park's groundbreaking work documents how
19th-century German historians of philosophy systematically excluded African
and Asian thought through explicitly racist arguments. Similarly, feminist
scholars have shown how women philosophers were marginalized through genre
dismissal, lack of institutional access, and historiographical erasure.

Second, decolonial and feminist critiques expose how canon formation perpetuates
"epistemic violence" (Grosfoguel) or "epistemicide" (de Sousa Santos)—the
systematic devaluation and destruction of non-Western and marginalized knowledge
systems. These critiques argue that what presents itself as universal philosophy
is actually the parochial knowledge of a narrow demographic: primarily men from
five Western European countries. The canon thus functions as a mechanism of
exclusion that determines whose voices count as "philosophical."

Third, debates over canon revision reveal tensions between different strategies
for change: "recovery" work that excavates marginalized figures, "critique" that
exposes canonical texts' complicity in oppression, and "abolition" that questions
whether reform is possible. Recent work questions whether adding diverse voices
to existing structures addresses the deeper epistemic frameworks that made
exclusion possible in the first place.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain is directly relevant to the metaphilosophical inquiry into literature
reviews because canon formation fundamentally shapes what counts as "the relevant
literature" for any philosophical inquiry. Literature reviews do not merely
survey a pre-existing field—they participate in reproducing or contesting
canonical boundaries. The mechanisms of canon formation (institutional gatekeeping,
genre hierarchies, citation practices) parallel the mechanisms through which
literature reviews constitute their objects. Understanding how canons emerge
through collective practices of recognition and exclusion illuminates how
literature reviews function as sites of epistemic and political power.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

While the literature extensively documents Western canon formation and its
critiques, there is less work on how canons operate in non-Western philosophical
traditions (though see the Confucian and Islamic philosophy examples). Additionally,
the empirical mechanisms linking canon formation to contemporary literature
review practices remain understudied—most work focuses on historical formation
rather than present-day reproduction. The relationship between digital infrastructure
(databases, search engines) and contemporary canon formation also needs attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the mechanisms and power dynamics of canon formation
rather than simply cataloging excluded figures. Connect historical analyses of
19th-century canon construction to contemporary practices of literature review
and philosophical pedagogy. Highlight tensions between different strategies for
change (recovery, critique, abolition) and their implications for rethinking
literature review methodology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical critique (8 papers): Documents racist, sexist, colonial origins of modern canon
- Decolonial/epistemicide frameworks (5 papers): Theorizes epistemic violence of Western universalism
- Feminist recovery and critique (4 papers): Both excavates excluded women and critiques canonical androcentrism
- Canon revision debates (3 papers): Examines strategies and politics of changing what counts as philosophy

  author = {Park, Peter K. J.},
  title = {Africa, Asia, and the History of Philosophy: Racism in the Formation of the Philosophical Canon, 1780--1830},
  year = {2013},
  publisher = {State University of New York Press},
  doi = {10.1353/book22395},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book documents how the modern Western philosophical canon
  was constructed through explicitly racist exclusions of African and Asian thought
  in 19th-century German historiography. Park traces how Kant, Hegel, and their
  successors systematically denied philosophical status to non-European traditions
  using racial arguments about capacity for abstract thought. The exclusion was
  not based on ignorance—European scholars knew these traditions—but on deliberate
  ideological construction. Park examines the institutional, pedagogical, and
  textual mechanisms through which this racialized canon became naturalized as
  "the history of philosophy" itself.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding how canon formation operates as an
  exclusionary political practice rather than neutral recognition of merit. Directly
  relevant to literature reviews because it shows how defining "what counts as
  philosophy" precedes and shapes any survey of "the philosophical literature."
  Park's analysis of how historiographical narratives construct canons parallels
  how literature reviews construct their objects. His documentation of racist
  arguments reveals the contingency of current canonical boundaries.

  POSITION: Historical critique documenting racist origins of Western philosophical
  canon. Foundational text for decolonial philosophy and canon revision debates.

  number = {1},
  pages = {21--33},
  doi = {10.1093/monist/onu004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Waithe analyzes the processes through which excluded philosophers—
  particularly women—might be integrated into the philosophical canon. Drawing on
  her decades of recovery work editing the four-volume *History of Women Philosophers*,
  she examines obstacles to canon revision including genre dismissal (treating women's
  philosophical writing as "not philosophy"), institutional gatekeeping, and the
  circular logic that excludes figures for lack of influence when exclusion itself
  prevented influence. Waithe argues that canon formation involves complex negotiations
  among multiple stakeholders and that simply "adding" marginalized figures without
  addressing underlying structures proves insufficient.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how canonical status is negotiated and reproduced.
  Relevant to literature review methodology because it illuminates how disciplinary
  boundaries and genre hierarchies shape what gets included as "relevant literature."
  Waithe's analysis of recovery work highlights tensions in attempting to revise
  canons from within existing institutional structures. Her emphasis on the politics
  of recognition connects to questions of how literature reviews legitimate or
  delegitimate certain voices.

  POSITION: Feminist recovery work with methodological reflection on canon revision.
  Bridges historical recovery and theoretical analysis of canon-formation mechanisms.

  volume = {16},
  number = {2},
  pages = {78--96},
  doi = {10.25159/2413-3086/3819},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Graness examines the challenges of writing a history of philosophy
  for African traditions, arguing that the discipline of history of philosophy has
  been instrumental in shaping exclusionary canons. She shows how African philosophical
  thought (traceable to ancient Egypt) has been systematically excluded through
  historiographical practices that privilege certain textual forms and conceptual
  frameworks. Graness argues that decolonizing the history of philosophy requires
  "conceptual decolonisation" (following Wiredu)—questioning the very categories
  through which philosophy is defined. The difficulty of writing African philosophy's
  history reveals how Eurocentric frameworks structure the discipline itself.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how historiographical practices shape canons and what
  counts as "philosophy." Directly relevant to literature review methodology because
  it shows how definitional questions precede empirical surveys—deciding what
  counts as "philosophical literature" already enacts exclusions. Graness's emphasis
  on conceptual decolonization suggests literature reviews must interrogate their
  own categorical frameworks, not just expand inclusion within existing categories.

  POSITION: Decolonial critique of history of philosophy as canon-forming practice.
  Emphasizes conceptual and categorical dimensions of exclusion.

It has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of philosophy, our philosophical canon and curricula. The history of philosophy in Africa is still a young discipline, although philosophical thinking (concepts, manuscripts, books and philosophers) can be traced back until ancient Egypt. Facing the problem of exclusion and inferiorisation of traditions of thought and philosophy in Africa, the discipline of the history of philosophy involves very specific problems and requires a project of “conceptual decolonisation”. This explains both the importance and the difficulty of writing a history of philosophy in Africa.},

  author = {Lapointe, Sandra and Reck, Erich},
  title = {Historiography and the Formation of Philosophical Canons},
  year = {2023},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781003184294},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume brings together diverse perspectives on how
  historiographical practices shape philosophical canons. Contributors examine case
  studies from multiple traditions (Western, Chinese, Indian) and historical periods
  to analyze the mechanisms of canon formation: pedagogical practices, institutional
  structures, translation politics, and narrative construction. The volume shows
  how canons emerge through contingent historical processes rather than tracking
  intrinsic philosophical importance. Several chapters address efforts to "diversify"
  canons and the theoretical challenges such efforts face.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic analysis of canon-formation mechanisms applicable
  to understanding literature review practices. The volume's comparative approach
  illuminates how canonization operates across contexts. Its attention to
  historiographical method connects directly to questions of how literature reviews
  construct their objects through narrative and selection. Multiple chapters address
  the politics of canon revision, relevant to debates about expanding philosophical
  literature.

  POSITION: Historiographical analysis of canon formation across traditions. Combines
  descriptive case studies with normative questions about canon revision.

  journal = {Hypatia},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {32},
  number = {3},
  pages = {488--505},
  doi = {10.1111/hypa.12333},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dhawan critiques the Eurocentric presumption that philosophy is
  fundamentally European, showing how Enlightenment universalism was constructed
  through colonial exclusions. She debunks claims that Kantian cosmopolitanism
  provided an antidote to colonialism, instead documenting how Enlightenment
  philosophy participated in epistemic violence that delegitimized non-European
  thought. Dhawan argues that simply "including" previously marginalized traditions
  within existing philosophical frameworks proves insufficient—the frameworks
  themselves must be decolonized. Drawing on Spivak, she proposes "transnational
  literacy" and "planetary ethics" as alternatives to liberal multicultural inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the fundamental question of what counts as "philosophy" and
  whose knowledge receives epistemic recognition. Directly relevant to literature
  reviews because it questions whether adding "diverse voices" to existing review
  structures addresses the deeper epistemic frameworks that enabled exclusion.
  Dhawan's critique of liberal inclusion suggests literature reviews require
  methodological transformation, not just expanded scope. Her emphasis on uneven
  epistemic agency illuminates power dynamics in citation and recognition practices.

  POSITION: Postcolonial feminist critique of Enlightenment universalism and
  Eurocentric philosophy. Argues for epistemic decolonization beyond inclusion.
  },
  keywords = {decolonial, Eurocentrism, Enlightenment, postcolonial-feminism, High},
  abstract = {Defenders of the Enlightenment highlight the long neglected anticolonial writings of thinkers like Immanuel Kant, which serve as a corrective to the misrepresentation of the Enlightenment's epistemological investment in imperialism. One of the most pervasive repercussions of the claim that the Enlightenment was always already anti‐imperial is that postcolonial critique is rendered redundant, and the project of decolonizing European philosophy becomes unnecessary. Contesting the exoneration of Enlightenment philosophers of racism and sexism, this article debunks the claim that Kantian cosmopolitanism was an antidote to colonialism. Addressing the ambivalent legacies of the European Enlightenment for the postcolonial world, with special focus on the “Syrian refugee crisis,” the article examines the enduring normative violence exerted by Enlightenment principles of cosmopolitanism and outlines the contested terrains that inflect current geopolitics of knowledge‐production. Given that the normative idea of philosophy, as defined during the Enlightenment, continues to delegitimize non‐European perspectives, the integration of previously marginalized knowledges into the philosophical canon is insufficient; rather, in order to desubalternize non‐Western epistemologies, it is imperative to undo the uneven distribution of epistemic agency globally. Drawing on Gayatri Spivak's ideas of transnational literacy and planetary ethics, the article concludes by underscoring the contribution of postcolonial‐feminist critique in imagining postimperial philosophy in a global age.},

  title = {The Structure of Knowledge in Westernized Universities: Epistemic Racism/Sexism and the Four Genocides/Epistemicides of the Long 16th Century},
  journal = {Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {11},
  number = {1},
  pages = {73--90},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grosfoguel argues that Westernized universities are structured by
  "epistemic racism/sexism"—the systematic privileging of knowledge produced by men
  from five Western European countries as universally valid while dismissing all other
  knowledge as particular, traditional, or non-scientific. He traces this structure
  to four epistemicides of the long 16th century: conquest of Al-Andalus, conquest
  of Americas, African enslavement, and European witch hunts. These genocides
  destroyed entire knowledge systems and ways of knowing. Modern disciplines embody
  this epistemic structure, with theory reduced to white European male experience
  presented as universal.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical framework for understanding how canon formation
  operates as "epistemicide"—not just exclusion but active destruction of knowledge
  systems. Directly relevant to literature reviews because it challenges the assumption
  that "relevant literature" can be identified through neutral bibliographic search—
  the very infrastructure of knowledge production embeds exclusionary structures.
  Grosfoguel's emphasis on epistemicide suggests literature reviews participate in
  reproducing or contesting colonial knowledge structures.

  POSITION: Decolonial critique theorizing epistemic violence and epistemicide.
  Connects historical colonial violence to contemporary university structures.

  number = {S1},
  pages = {43--70},
  doi = {10.1111/sjp.12346},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kim distinguishes between "alterior" philosophies (culturally
  different from Western traditions) and "analectical" philosophies (emerging from
  politically subordinated positions, following Dussel). He examines challenges of
  epistemic decolonization in US philosophy, arguing that simply including
  "non-Western" traditions proves insufficient without addressing power relations
  that structure philosophical discourse. Kim analyzes institutional Eurocentrism
  in canon, curriculum, and credentialization practices, showing how these structures
  reproduce epistemic colonization even when superficially diversified.

  RELEVANCE: Provides nuanced framework for understanding different dimensions of
  canon exclusion (cultural alterity vs. political subordination). Relevant to
  literature reviews because it distinguishes between including "different perspectives"
  and addressing power structures that determine what counts as legitimate philosophy.
  Kim's analysis of institutional structures (canon, curriculum, credentialization)
  parallels mechanisms through which literature reviews legitimate certain sources
  while marginalizing others.

  POSITION: Decolonial philosophy analyzing institutional structures of epistemic
  exclusion. Distinguishes cultural difference from political subordination.

  abstract = {Abstract This essay explores some conceptual and diagnostic frameworks to advance epistemic decolonization in the US philosophical profession. A central focus is the distinction between those philosophies of formerly colonized peoples that are culturally alterior or, simply, alterior and those that are analectical in the Dusselian sense of emerging from a subordinated political position. The paper begins by reflecting upon connections between coloniality, the alterior, and the analectical to frame the discussion of epistemic decolonization in the philosophy profession. It then considers a knower's core theoretic reconstruction in the task of epistemic decolonization and identifies some ambiguities in reconciling alterior traditions with analectical theoretical reconstruction. The work of Charles Mills and Enrique Dussel are considered as case studies. The paper concludes with critical reflections on the institutional network of canon, curriculum, and other conceptual and credentialization structures that constitute institutional Eurocentrism.},

  volume = {2},
  number = {2},
  pages = {253--273},
  doi = {10.1017/apa.2016.11},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Connell and Janssen-Lauret analyze how evaluative labels like
  "bad philosophy" and "derivative philosophy" have been weaponized to exclude women
  from the philosophical canon. They focus on early-to-mid 20th century analytic
  women philosophers who published in mainstream journals and held philosophy
  positions, yet were systematically dismissed and forgotten. The authors show how
  these exclusions occurred through subtextual mechanisms—not explicit claims that
  "women can't philosophize" but dismissals of specific women's work as insufficiently
  original or rigorous. They argue these evaluative practices reveal implicit bias
  in how "good philosophy" is recognized.

  RELEVANCE: Exposes mechanisms of canon gatekeeping beyond explicit exclusion,
  showing how evaluative criteria can function as implicit exclusion. Directly
  relevant to literature reviews because it illuminates how judgments of "relevance,"
  "importance," or "quality" can embed bias. The authors' focus on women who met
  all formal criteria yet were excluded suggests literature reviews must examine
  not just who gets included but how evaluative standards themselves may be biased.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of implicit exclusion through evaluative standards.
  Focuses on analytic tradition and 20th century.

  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--18},
  doi = {10.1017/apa.2019.36},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bergès examines why recovered women philosophers remain on "the
  outskirts of the canon"—known individually but not integrated into standard
  narratives of philosophy's development. She argues the "lone female philosopher"
  framing (pairing each woman with a canonical male figure) obscures the intellectual
  networks and conversations among women philosophers themselves. Bergès proposes
  three strategies: creating courses focused entirely on women philosophers to
  establish their intellectual traditions, pairing women with canonical men as
  interlocutors, and reconstructing women's intellectual networks. She examines
  barriers to integration including pedagogical structures and historiographical
  conventions.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses why recovery work alone doesn't transform canons, relevant
  to debates about literature review reform. Bergès's analysis of the "lone female
  philosopher" problem illuminates how inclusion can occur without challenging
  underlying narrative structures. Her pedagogical focus connects to how literature
  reviews teach readers what counts as "the conversation" in a field. The emphasis
  on intellectual networks rather than isolated figures suggests literature reviews
  could reconstruct marginalized traditions rather than just adding individual voices.

  abstract = {Abstract Philosophical views of responsibility often identify responsible agency with capacities such as rationality and self-control. Yet in ordinary life, we frequently hold individuals responsible who are deficient in these capacities, such as children or people with mental illness. The existing literature that addresses these cases has suggested that we merely pretend to hold these agents responsible or that they are responsible to a diminished degree. In this paper, I demonstrate that neither of these approaches is satisfactory, and I offer an alternative focused on the role relationships play in determining whether it is appropriate to hold someone responsible. I argue that relationships are sources of normative expectations about how parties in that relationship ought to behave and that we can be responsible in virtue of being subject to these norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zorrilla analyzes multiple causes of women philosophers' exclusion
  from early modern canon: lack of institutional access, genre dismissal, historical
  contingencies, and subsequent historiographical practices. She argues against
  monolithic explanations, showing how different mechanisms operated for different
  figures. Zorrilla then examines how digital humanities methods (network analysis,

  by making visible marginalized figures and reconstructing intellectual networks.
  However, she cautions that digital methods risk reproducing biases if not

  cause explanations. Relevant to literature reviews because it shows how multiple
  institutional, historical, and epistemic factors intersect to produce canon.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Shapiro distinguishes three elements of a philosophical canon:
  a causal story (how ideas develop), core philosophical questions, and distinctively
  philosophical works. She argues that recent historiographical work contextualizing
  early modern philosophy within history of science subtly shifts what counts as
  central philosophical questions, allowing previously marginalized figures (especially
  women natural philosophers) to become philosophically central. Shapiro shows how
  changing the questions asked transforms who counts as answering them. This suggests
  canon revision requires rethinking core problems, not just adding new figures.

  RELEVANCE: Provides analytical framework for understanding canon structure beyond
  mere lists of figures. Directly relevant to literature reviews because it shows
  how problem-definition shapes what literature becomes relevant—reviews don't just
  survey existing literature but constitute their object through how they frame

  CORE ARGUMENT: Elkind analyzes different positions on canon revision, distinguishing
  "canon-menders" (who seek to reform existing canons), "canon-expanders" (who add
  marginalized figures), and "canon-shredders" (who reject canonical structures
  entirely). He provides a partial argument for canon-shredding, contending that
  mending and expanding strategies preserve problematic power structures that enabled
  exclusion in the first place. Elkind examines how canons function institutionally

  at stake in different approaches to expanding "relevant literature"—is the goal
  to reform existing structures or to fundamentally transform what counts as

  abstract = {The idea of 'the canon' has a long history across the humanities, including philosophy. It is important to recognise, however, that the canon is, in large part, a device designed to compensate for our own human cognitive limitations: there is only so much that we can hold in memory and intellectually manage at one time. If, instead, we had a means of expanding our storage and processing capacities to indefinite size and speed, 'the canon' might be dramatically expanded in size, or even be eliminated altogether in favour of using the entire corpus of a given author, period or philosophical perspective. The new 'digital history' enables us to do exactly that by externalising (certain aspects of) our scholarly work to computers, and then using the output (often an information-dense data visualisation) to advance our knowledge further than would have been possible by means of native brainpower alone. In this chapter, the author discusses these issues and then briefly reviews four instances of digital historical work on the disciplinary boundary between philosophy and psychology in order to provide a variety of examples in which this emerging new approach to scholarship can work for historians of philosophy.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Smith examines canon formation in the period immediately after
  Kant, bringing together three contemporary scholarly strands: critique of the
  rationalism/empiricism distinction (Vanzo), histories of women's exclusion
  (O'Neill), and histories of non-European philosophy's exclusion (Park). He shows
  how post-Kantian historiography of philosophy constructed a narrative that
  simultaneously established Kant as the culmination of modern philosophy and
  excluded both women and non-European traditions. Smith argues these exclusions
  were mutually reinforcing, with similar mechanisms operating across different
  marginalized groups.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how canon formation operates through historiographical
  narrative construction, not just individual exclusions. Relevant to literature
  reviews because it shows how narratives of intellectual development shape what
  counts as "foundational literature." Smith's integration of feminist and
  decolonial critiques suggests literature reviews should attend to intersectional
  dimensions of exclusion. His focus on post-Kantian period shows how canonical
  narratives congeal at specific historical moments with lasting effects.

  abstract = {The premise of this chapter is that the current philosophical canon does not adequately represent non-white-dead-European-males (non-DWEMs). In response to 'the problem of representation', some argue that, because the canon is inherently racist, sexist, elitist or otherwise hierarchical, it should be abolished altogether. Others argue that despite a lamentable history of exclusion, the canon should be preserved and made more inclusive or pluralistic. The author offers a third response: we ought to reimagine the canon in a way that helps us to understand why certain contributions have been wrongly excluded and that encourages us to reconsider who belongs on the list. To help make his case, the author introduces the reader to four (non-canonical) Mexican philosophers to make three points. First, the traditional canon is imperialistic in the sense that it is based on an understanding of the Western tradition that justifies our ignorance of other traditions and makes us indifferent to our ignorance. Second, the purpose of canonical works is to help us grow into our full humanity. Third, we ought to understand our common humanity in terms of the precariousness and fragility of human existence that one Mexican philosopher calls our 'common accidentality'. The aim of reimagining the canon then is not to make it more inclusive in the sense of adding marginalised figures to an already established list but to identify new criteria for reconsidering everyone on and off the list.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gordon explores five ways philosophy could be colonized: racial/ethnic
  origins, coloniality of norms, market commodification, disciplinary decadence,
  and solipsism. He argues Western philosophy's universalizing pretensions mask
  its particularity and complicity with colonial power structures. Gordon examines
  conditions for decolonizing philosophy including unlocking its liberatory potential,
  identifying humanistic dimensions, rethinking metaphysical assumptions, and
  embracing political responsibility for knowledge production. He distinguishes
  philosophy as intellectual practice from its professional institutionalization.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic framework for understanding philosophy's coloniality
  across multiple dimensions. Relevant to literature reviews because it shows how
  colonization operates not just through explicit exclusion but through norms,
  methodologies, and institutional structures. Gordon's distinction between philosophy
  and its professional practice suggests literature reviews participate in either
  reproducing or contesting disciplinary colonization. His emphasis on political
  responsibility for knowledge production raises questions about literature reviews'
  ethical dimensions.

  POSITION: Decolonial philosophy examining multiple dimensions of disciplinary
  colonization. Prescriptive argument for transforming philosophy.

  pages = {34--45},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Westphal argues the philosophical canon functions as a "flexible,
  normative fact"—neither rigidly fixed nor purely arbitrary, but open to revision
  while maintaining normative force. He examines how canons balance continuity with
  change, allowing for gradual shifts while preserving enough stability for
  intergenerational conversation. Westphal defends canons against complete relativism
  while acknowledging their contingency and revisability. He argues canonical status
  emerges through collective recognition rather than intrinsic properties, but this
  social construction doesn't render canons merely ideological.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical analysis of canons' normative status, relevant
  to debates about whether literature reviews should defer to or contest canonical
  judgments. Westphal's "flexible normative fact" framework suggests literature
  reviews both reflect and shape what counts as central literature, participating
  in ongoing collective negotiations over canonicity. His emphasis on enabling
  intergenerational conversation raises questions about how literature reviews
  balance tradition with innovation.

  POSITION: Moderate position defending canons' value while acknowledging contingency.
  Philosophical analysis of normative status.
