====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines how the discipline of philosophy operates as a social and institutional system. The sociology of philosophy studies philosophical knowledge production through the lens of social structures, intellectual networks, and institutional practices. Key contributions come from Carl-Göran Heidegren and Henrik Lundberg, who articulate the field's basic approach as praxeological—treating philosophy as socially situated practices that result in arguments and doctrines. Martin Kusch's foundational case study of psychologism demonstrates how philosophical controversies can be analyzed sociologically.

Bibliometric studies reveal citation patterns and prestige hierarchies within philosophy. Petrovich and colleagues pioneer "mention extraction"—going beyond standard citation analysis to capture how philosophers reference each other in text. These studies show philosophy's relationship to empirical sciences is increasing (Rehren & Armbruster 2025), though philosophy of mind and applied ethics engage more with neuroscience than "core" analytic areas (Petrovich & Viola 2024). Lisciandra (2025) critiques citation metrics from a philosophy of science perspective, arguing they fail to "carve science at its joints" by ignoring field-specific differences. De Bruin (2023) provides both meta-rankings and new survey data on journal prestige.

The peer review system attracts significant scrutiny. Heesen and Bright (2021) argue prepublication peer review should be abolished in favor of postpublication review on epistemic grounds. Katzav and Vaesen examine how stringent peer review affects pluralism. Gender and diversity studies document persistent underrepresentation: Leuschner (2019) identifies women's lower submission rates to journals as an indirect effect of social biases. Laakso and Polonioli (2018) map open access availability in ethics, finding ethicists simultaneously prone to copyright infringement and undersharing. Studies on language bias (Contesi et al.) and canonical gatekeeping (Connell & Janssen-Lauret) show how institutional practices exclude non-Anglophone and women philosophers.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses the social and institutional structures that shape what literature is available to be reviewed. The gatekeeping mechanisms examined here—peer review, journal prestige hierarchies, gender and racial demographics, language bias—determine which voices and arguments enter the philosophical record. For a metaphilosophical inquiry into literature review methodology, understanding these selection pressures is essential: literature reviews do not operate on a neutral body of texts, but on a corpus shaped by institutional power structures. The bibliometric work also models methodologies that could be applied to study literature review practices themselves.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

The field lacks comprehensive empirical studies of how literature reviews in philosophy are actually conducted—what search strategies philosophers use, which sources they privilege, how they determine scope. Most work focuses on article and book publication, not on review articles or synthetic scholarship. The relationship between prestige hierarchies and what gets reviewed (versus merely published) remains underexplored. Non-Anglophone philosophy's bibliometric patterns need more attention beyond language bias studies.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesis should emphasize the tension between philosophy's self-image as pursuing timeless truths and the empirical evidence of its operation as a socially structured profession with gatekeeping mechanisms. The work on peer review and gender/diversity connects to the ethics of literature reviews: whose work do we have epistemic obligations to seek out? The bibliometric studies provide methodological models but also cautionary tales about the limits of quantitative approaches in humanities disciplines.

  year = {2024},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781003426288},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces sociology of philosophy as a research field examining the discipline from a sociological perspective through three case studies of Swedish and Scandinavian philosophy. Argues for studying philosophy as socially situated practices that produce arguments and doctrines in text, rather than treating philosophical ideas as pure intellectual objects.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the foundational framework for this entire domain. For literature review methodology, this perspective reveals how reviews operate within social structures of the discipline—what we review is shaped by institutional affiliations, professional networks, and disciplinary boundaries. The book's focus on how philosophy operates in practice (not just theory) applies directly to understanding how literature reviews function as scholarly practices.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defines sociology of philosophy as theory-based empirical sociological study with praxeological approach—doing philosophy involves socially situated practices yielding philosophical arguments and doctrines fixed in text. Distinguishes this from traditional history of philosophy and from purely external social analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the methodological foundation that later work in this domain builds upon. For metaphilosophy of literature reviews, this article's emphasis on practices is crucial: literature reviews are not just intellectual products but social practices embedded in institutional contexts (academic job markets, journal hierarchies, disciplinary training).

In the first part, the type of empirical material and the forms of data presentation that are available to the sociology of philosophy are discussed. In the second part, the focus is on two important attempts, those of Randall Collins and Pierre Bourdieu, to develop general sociological theories about the relationship between social being and thought. The main lesson to be drawn from them is that in normal circumstances philosophical thought cannot be reduced to socio-political conditions outside the attention space (Collins) or the philosophical field (Bourdieu). In the concluding part, we tentatively sketch a programme for a future sociology of philosophy. All in all, the sociology of philosophy is seen as an emerging new subdivision within sociology, the potential of which is far from exhausted with respect to theoretical development as well as empirical approaches.},

  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies sociology of knowledge to the psychologism debate in late 19th and early 20th century philosophy, showing how philosophical arguments and positions were shaped by social factors including institutional structures, disciplinary boundaries, and academic rivalries. Demonstrates that philosophical controversies have sociological dimensions beyond pure logical or conceptual issues.

  RELEVANCE: Landmark case study showing how sociological analysis can illuminate philosophical debates. For literature review methodology, this suggests that what counts as "relevant literature" is not purely determined by logical relevance but by social factors—disciplinary boundaries, institutional affiliations, and citation networks shape what is considered important to review.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Standard citation-based bibliometric tools have severe limitations for periods before current citation practices. Presents method for extracting and analyzing mentions (not just formal citations) to map scholarly networks in Anglophone philosophy 1890-1979. Successfully links 93% of 1,095,765 mention links with 82-91% precision, demonstrating mentions reveal more social connections than co-authorship data (average 5.3 individuals mentioned vs 1.3 co-authors).

  RELEVANCE: Methodologically important for studying philosophical communication patterns beyond formal citations. For literature reviews, this reveals that influence and relevance operate through multiple channels—not just who cites whom, but who mentions, discusses, and engages with whom. Literature reviewers implicitly make mention-based judgments (not just citation-based) about what to include.

  POSITION: Methodological innovation in bibliometric analysis of philosophy.

This paper presents an alternative method involving the extracting and analysis of mentions to map and analyze links between scholars and texts in periods that fall outside the scope of citation-based studies. Focusing on one specific discipline in one particular period and language area—Anglophone philosophy between 1890 and 1979—we describe a procedure to create a mention index by identifying, extracting, and disambiguating mentions in academic publications. Our mention index includes 1,095,765 mention links, extracted from 22,977 articles published in 12 journals. We successfully link 93% of these mentions to specific philosophers, with an estimated precision of 82% to 91%. Moreover, we integrate the mention index into a database named EDHIPHY, which includes data and metadata from multiple sources and enables multidimensional mention analyses. In the final part of the paper, we present four case studies conducted by domain experts, demonstrating the use and the potential of both EDHIPHY and mention analyses more generally.},

  journal = {Episteme},
  year = {2025},
  pages = {1--15},
  doi = {10.1017/epi.2024.46},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes citation metrics from Kuhnian philosophy of science perspective, arguing they interfere with normal science development in certain fields. Main issue: citation metrics fail to account for field-specific differences, thereby selectively favoring some fields and arbitrarily hindering others. Current metrics don't "carve science at its joints"—they impose external categories that distort the actual structure of scientific communities.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis of quantitative evaluation methods with direct implications for literature review methodology. If citation metrics systematically distort field differences, then citation-based methods for identifying "important" literature will reproduce those distortions. Literature reviewers using citation counts to determine significance risk amplifying existing bibliometric biases rather than identifying genuinely important work.

  abstract_source = {s2},
 Citation metrics are statistical measures of scientific output that draw on citation indexes. They purport to capture the impact of scientific articles and the journals in which they appear. As evaluative tools, they are mostly used in the natural sciences, but they are also acquiring an important role in the humanities. While the strengths and weaknesses of citation metrics are extensively debated in a variety of fields, they have only recently started attracting attention in the philosophy of science literature. This paper takes a further step in this direction and presents an analysis of citation metrics from the perspective of a Kuhnian model for the development of science. Starting from Gillies’ argument against the use of citation metrics for scientific research (2008), this paper shows that citation metrics interfere with the development of normal science in certain fields or subfields. The main issue is that citation metrics do not take field-specific differences into account, thereby selectively favoring some fields and arbitrarily hindering the development of others. In other words, this paper shows that current citation metrics fail to “carve science at its joints”. In light of this, the paper cautions against their use for evaluative purposes.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses citation analysis to examine whether philosophy has become more "scientific" by analyzing citation patterns between philosophy and empirical sciences. Finds increasing but still asymmetric cross-citation, with philosophy citing sciences more than sciences cite philosophy. Different philosophical subfields show varying degrees of scientific engagement.

  RELEVANCE: Documents empirical trends in philosophy's relationship to sciences, relevant for understanding what literature counts as "philosophical" versus "scientific" and how disciplinary boundaries shape literature review scope. Shows that what gets reviewed as "philosophy" is historically contingent—contemporary philosophy engages more with empirical work than past philosophy did.

Discusses limitations of both citation-based and survey-based rankings.

  RELEVANCE: Documents prestige hierarchies that shape what literature gets published and reviewed. Journal rankings influence both what gets published (editors' decisions) and what gets reviewed (scholars' judgments of importance). The finding that affiliations bias assessments raises questions about how institutional positions shape literature review practices. If journal prestige affects citation and review, then literature reviews reproduce existing prestige hierarchies.

In addition to assessing journal quality, data were gathered on various variables such as gender, age, years in academia, number of refereed publications, area of specialization, and journal affiliation (as an author or editor). Findings indicate that only area of specialization and affiliation have some influence on respondents’ assessments.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Investigates what happens when philosophy meets game theory and network science through citation analysis of Synthese and Philosophy of Science articles 1985-2021. Finds philosophers interested not only in game theory as formal method but also its applications in empirical disciplines. Philosophy employs network science as formal tool in social epistemology but considers network science results in causality/explanation debates.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how philosophers selectively engage with formal methods from other fields, relevant for understanding interdisciplinary literature review practices. Demonstrates that citation patterns reveal distinct ways philosophers appropriate methods versus results from other disciplines. Literature reviewers face similar choices about whether to include formal methods as tools or as objects of philosophical analysis.

  abstract = {The article investigates what happens when philosophy (of science) meets and begins to establish connections with two formal research methods such as game theory and network science. We use citation analysis to identify, among the articles published in Synthese and Philosophy of Science between 1985 and 2021, those that cite the specialistic literature in game theory and network science. Then, we investigate the structure of the two corpora thus identified by bibliographic coupling and divide them into clusters of related papers by automatic community detection. Lastly, we construct by the same bibliometric techniques a reference map of philosophy, on which we overlay our corpora to map the diffusion of game theory and network science in the various sub-areas of recent philosophy. Three main results derive from this study. (i) Philosophers are interested not only in using and investigating game theory as a formal method belonging to applied mathematics and sharing many relevant features with social choice theory, but also in considering its applications in more empirically oriented disciplines such as social psychology, cognitive science, or biology. (ii) Philosophers focus on networks in two research contexts and in two different ways: in the debate on causality and scientific explanation, they consider the results of network science; in social epistemology, they employ network science as a formal tool. (iii) In the reference map, logic—whose use in philosophy dates back to a much earlier period—is distributed in a more uniform way than recently encountered disciplines such as game theory and network science. We conclude by discussing some methodological limitations of our bibliometric approach, especially with reference to the problem of field delineation.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues prepublication peer review should be abolished and replaced with postpublication peer review, judging purely on epistemic grounds. Prepublication peer review creates gatekeeping that may exclude valuable work, while postpublication review allows wider initial dissemination followed by community evaluation. Changed incentive structures would alter social structure of science by reducing power of individual gatekeepers.

  RELEVANCE: Radical proposal with direct implications for what literature is available to review. If peer review shapes what gets published (and thus what can be reviewed), then critique of peer review is critique of the corpus available for literature reviews. The argument that gatekeeping excludes valuable work applies equally to literature reviews—reviewers face gatekeeping decisions about what to include. Postpublication review model suggests rethinking when and how evaluation occurs.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Empirical evidence indicates women philosophers submit work to journals substantially less often than male colleagues. This difference in submission behavior correlates with other gendered behavioral patterns: reluctance to participate in discussions, willingness to do low-prestige work, and specialization in certain topics. These differences are indirect effects of social biases—effects on working behavior of members of targeted social groups.

  RELEVANCE: Documents how gender biases shape not just what gets published but who submits work for publication, directly affecting the corpus available for literature reviews. If women submit less due to social biases, then literature reviews of published work will underrepresent women's philosophical contributions. The emphasis on indirect effects suggests biases operate through subtle behavioral mechanisms that literature reviewers should be aware of when assessing whose work to include.

  RELEVANCE: Documents access barriers that shape what literature is practically available for review. If half of ethics publications are behind paywalls, then literature reviews will be biased toward what reviewers can access—favoring authors at well-funded institutions.

This study provides a detailed mapping of the bibliometric state of open access to journal publications among ethicists, taking into account not only open access publishing in journals directly, but also where and in what form ethicists make their journal articles available elsewhere on the web. As part of the study 297 ethicists affiliated with top-ranking philosophy departments were identified and their journal publication information for the years 2010–2015 were recorded (1682 unique articles). The journal articles were then queried for through Google Scholar in order to establish open access status (web locations, document versions) of each publication record. Publication records belonging to the 20 most frequently used journal outlets (subset of 597 unique articles) were put under closer inspection with regards to alignment with publisher copyright restrictions as well as measuring unused potential to share articles. The results show that slightly over half of recent journal publications are available to read for free. PhilPapers and academic social networks (Academia.edu and ResearchGate) were found to be key platforms for research dissemination in ethics research. The representation of institutional repositories as providers of access was found to be weak, receiving the second lowest frequency rating among the eight discrete web location categories.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Study found 97% of citations in elite analytic philosophy journals were to work originally written in English; 73% of sampled papers cited no non-English work.

Greater internationalization, transparency, and reduction of hiring/publishing based on contacts and pedigree would benefit the field.

  RELEVANCE: Dramatic documentation of how language shapes what literature is available and considered relevant. If elite journals publish almost exclusively English-language citations, literature reviews in analytic philosophy will reproduce this bias by drawing on elite journals as sources.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Efforts to include women in philosophical canon face reactionary gatekeeping typified by charge "That's not philosophy." Interestingly, this charge doesn't apply to early analytic women philosophers (Welby, Ladd-Franklin, Stebbing, Ambrose, MacDonald) who published in major journals. Yet they remain excluded from canon, labeled as doing "bad" or "derivative" philosophy. These gatekeeping labels maintain canonical exclusion despite women's meeting standard criteria for inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how evaluative language functions as gatekeeping mechanism beyond formal publication barriers. Even women who publish in "top" venues face delegitimization through labels questioning quality or originality. For literature reviews, this suggests importance of scrutinizing one's own criteria for inclusion—are standards being applied evenhandedly, or are implicit biases operating through quality judgments?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Quantitative analysis of philosophy-neuroscience nexus using citation analysis.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how different philosophical subfields engage differently with empirical sciences, relevant for understanding what counts as philosophical versus scientific literature. Philosophy of mind's engagement with neuroscience means literature reviews in that area must navigate disciplinary boundaries differently than reviews in metaphysics or logic. The asymmetric visibility patterns (philosophy cites neuroscience more than vice versa) suggests philosophers are more likely to review neuroscience literature than neuroscientists are to review philosophy.

Combining bibliometric indicators of cross-field visibility with journal citation mapping techniques, we investigate four dimensions of the nexus: how the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and of philosophy in neuroscience has changed over time, which areas of philosophy are more interested in neuroscience, which areas of neuroscience are more interested in philosophy, and how the trading zone between the two fields is configured. We also discuss two hypotheses: the supposed occurrence of a neuro-revolution in philosophy and the role of psychology as the disciplinary link between neuroscience and philosophy. Both the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and the visibility of philosophy in neuroscience have increased significantly from 1980 to 2020, albeit the latter remains an order of magnitude lower than the former. Neuroscience is particularly visible in philosophy of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of science, but not in ‘core’ areas of analytic philosophy. Philosophy is particularly visible in cognitive and systems neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, but not in biomedical neuroscience. As for the trading zone between philosophy and neuroscience, our data show that it works differently in philosophy and in neuroscience. While some philosophy journals are active loci of bidirectional communication, neuroscience journals are divided between journals ‘importing’ philosophy in neuroscience and journals ‘exporting’ neuroscience to philosophy. Lastly, data do not support the hypothesis that a widespread neuro-revolution has transformed philosophy radically, but support the hypothesis that psychology functions as a mediating disciplinary link between philosophy and neuroscience.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mainstream philosophy journals have implemented increasingly stringent peer review, probably attempting to prevent editorial decisions based on non-merit factors.

More stringent review concentrates power in hands of established scholars whose judgments may reflect mainstream biases.

  RELEVANCE: Connects peer review practices to philosophical diversity, with implications for what literature is available. If stringent peer review reduces pluralism, literature reviews drawing on peer-reviewed journals will have narrower range of philosophical approaches available. The tension between quality control and pluralism is fundamental challenge for literature review methodology—how to maintain standards while ensuring diverse perspectives are represented?

  POSITION: Critique of peer review's effects on philosophical pluralism.

  abstract = {\u3cp\u3eRecently, mainstream philosophy journals have tended to implement more and more stringent forms of peer review (e.g., from double-anonymous to triple-anonymous), probably in an attempt to prevent editorial decisions that are based on factors other than quality. Against this trend, we propose that journals should relax their standards of acceptance, as well as be less restrictive about whom is to decide what is admitted into the debate. We start by arguing, partly on the basis of the history of peer review in the journal Mind, that past and current peer review practices attest to partisanship with respect to philosophical approach (at least). Then, we explain that such partisanship conflicts with the standard aims of peer review, and that it is both epistemically and morally problematic. This assessment suggests that, if feasible, journals should treat all available and proposed standards of acceptance in philosophy as epistemically equal, and that philosophical work should be evaluated in terms of the novelty and significance of its contribution to developing thought in ways that are of value. Finally, we show, in a programmatic way, that improving the current situation is feasible, and can be done fairly easily.\u3c/p\u3},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Anglophone philosophy has well-known gender equity problem, most stark at faculty level (only 22-24% female in US, UK, Australia). Paper examines why female students leave philosophy, finding problem begins at undergraduate level. Multiple factors contribute including teaching styles, lack of female role models, and disciplinary culture that may be experienced as unwelcoming by women.

  RELEVANCE: Documents pipeline problem in philosophy profession starting at undergraduate level. If fewer women enter and remain in philosophy, this affects not just current faculty demographics but future generation of philosophers whose work will be reviewed. For literature review ethics, this raises questions about actively seeking out work by underrepresented groups rather than passively reviewing what appears in mainstream venues.

  POSITION: Empirical study of gender disparities in philosophy education.

  abstract = {Why does female under- representation emerge during undergraduate education? At the University of Sydney, we surveyed students before and after their first philosophy course. We failed to find any evidence that this course disproportionately discouraged female students from continuing in philosophy relative to male students. Instead, we found evidence of an interaction effect between gender and existing attitudes about philosophy coming into tertiary education that appears at least partially responsible for this poor retention. At the first lecture, disproportionately few female students intended to major. Further, at the first lecture, female students were less interested in philosophy, were less self-confident about philosophy, and were less able to imagine themselves as philosophers. Similarly, female students predicted they would feel more uncomfortable in philosophy classes than male students did. Further study with a control is warranted to determine whether this interaction effect is peculiar to philosophy, or whether it is indicative of a more general gendered trend amongst first year undergraduate students},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reflects on philosophy as profession from perspective of philosopher who doesn't fit dominant demographic. Uses metaphor of "concrete flowers"—those who grow in hostile environments—to describe experience of philosophers from marginalized groups. Argues profession must reckon with ways its structures and cultures exclude certain voices and perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Personal reflection that illuminates structural exclusions in philosophy profession. For literature review methodology, this emphasizes that what literature exists and is recognized reflects not neutral merit but professional structures that advantage some and disadvantage others. Literature reviewers have ethical obligations to question whose voices are absent and why, not just to summarize what's present in mainstream venues.

  POSITION: Critical reflection on philosophy profession from marginalized perspective.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses co-citation analysis to examine empirically-informed philosophy of mind's cross-disciplinary structure. Finds multiple clusters of work characterized by different disciplinary integrations—some more philosophical, others more empirical. The field is genuinely interdisciplinary but with distinct research communities that cite different literatures.

  RELEVANCE: Methodologically relevant for understanding how philosophical subfields structure themselves around different bodies of literature. For literature reviews in philosophy of mind, this suggests need to navigate between philosophical and empirical literatures, and awareness that different research communities within same general field may draw on very different sources.

  POSITION: Bibliometric study of interdisciplinary philosophy of mind.
