## The Ethics of the Literature Review -- Injustice, Exclusion, and the Politics of Selection

If the previous section established that there is no settled methodology for philosophical literature reviews, this section argues that the stakes of this absence are not merely methodological but ethical. Literature reviews are not neutral surveys of pre-existing knowledge. They are practices through which epistemic recognition is conferred or withheld, canons are reproduced or contested, and the boundaries of "legitimate philosophy" are policed. When a reviewer decides what to include and what to omit, these decisions carry ethical weight -- they can enact precisely the forms of epistemic injustice that philosophers have identified in other domains but have rarely applied to their own scholarly practices.

### Epistemic Injustice and Citational Practice

Miranda Fricker's (2007) foundational framework identifies two distinctively epistemic wrongs: testimonial injustice, in which identity prejudice causes a speaker to receive deflated credibility, and hermeneutical injustice, in which gaps in collective interpretive resources prevent marginalized groups from making sense of their experiences. Citation is a form of testimonial recognition. Who gets cited, whose work is treated as authoritative, and whose contributions are rendered invisible all reflect and reinforce patterns of epistemic injustice. To exclude a scholar's work from a literature review on the basis of prejudice -- whether explicit or implicit -- is to wrong them in their capacity as a knower.

Kristie Dotson (2014) expands this framework in a direction that bears directly on literature reviews. Her account of epistemic oppression as operating through "irreducibly reliable" structural patterns shifts the focus from individual prejudice to systematic exclusion. When entire traditions or demographic groups are consistently absent from bibliographies, this cannot be explained by the failings of individual reviewers alone; it reflects structural features of knowledge production. The concept of contributory injustice -- in which marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to collective hermeneutical resources -- applies with particular force to literature reviews, since these are precisely the sites where collective understanding of "the state of the art" is constructed.

Recent work has made these connections more explicit. Dadze-Arthur and Mangai (2024) identify citational justice as a facet of testimonial justice, arguing that citational patterns in academic journals reflect and perpetuate epistemic exclusion. Pratt and de Vries (2023) document three layers through which epistemic injustice operates in knowledge production: who produces knowledge, what theories are applied, and whose voices are sought. All three are operative in literature reviews. Yuan and Peterson (2025) argue that citation confers power and authority, making citational choices morally significant acts with consequences that extend beyond knowledge transmission.

Yet the demand for citational justice is not straightforward. Davis (2016) demonstrates that credibility excess -- not just deficit -- can constitute testimonial injustice. Simply increasing citation of marginalized scholars risks perpetuating injustice if done in identity-reductive ways: citing women only on gender topics, or scholars of color only on race, reduces them to group representatives rather than recognizing them as autonomous epistemic agents. Tokenistic inclusion does not achieve citational justice. Furthermore, Bruton et al. (2023) find in an empirical survey that social justice-motivated citation is controversial among scholars -- many view intentionally citing underrepresented groups as ethically questionable "strategic citation." This reveals a genuine tension between traditional epistemic norms of merit-based selection and the demands of citational justice, a tension that literature review methodology must confront rather than elide.

### Canon Formation and the Pre-Selection of "Relevant Literature"

Before any individual reviewer makes choices about what to include, the available "literature" has already been shaped by canon formation processes that embed historical exclusions. Park (2013) documents how the modern Western philosophical canon was constructed through explicitly racist exclusions of African and Asian thought in nineteenth-century German historiography. What presents itself as "the history of philosophy" was deliberately narrowed through racial arguments about who was capable of abstract thought. This is not an incidental bias to be corrected but a structural feature of the discipline's self-understanding.

Graness (2018) draws out the implications for philosophical methodology: writing a history of philosophy for African traditions requires "conceptual decolonisation" -- questioning the very categories through which philosophy is defined. Literature reviews face an analogous challenge. The decision about what counts as "philosophical literature" is not a neutral bibliographic act but an exercise of definitional power that can reproduce or contest canonical boundaries. Connell and Janssen-Lauret (2016) show that even scholars who met all formal criteria for canonical status -- women who published in major analytic journals and held philosophy positions -- were nevertheless excluded through evaluative labels like "bad philosophy" or "derivative philosophy." This reveals that quality judgments in literature reviews can embed implicit bias while appearing to rest on neutral standards.

The decolonial literature raises the stakes further. Dhawan (2017) argues that simply "including" non-Western traditions within existing philosophical frameworks reproduces the epistemic structures that enabled their exclusion. The frameworks themselves must be decolonized. Elkind (2023) usefully distinguishes "canon-menders," "canon-expanders," and "canon-shredders," pressing the question of whether literature review reform should aim to broaden existing review practices or to fundamentally rethink what reviewing means. If canons are products of what Grosfoguel (2013) calls "epistemicide" -- the destruction of entire knowledge systems through colonialism -- then literature reviews operating on the resulting corpus are already operating on epistemically impoverished terrain.

### Structural Conditions -- What the Sociology of Philosophy Reveals

The ethical dimensions of literature reviews become empirically visible through the sociology of philosophy. Heidegren and Lundberg (2010) establish the foundational insight that philosophical knowledge production is socially situated practice. Literature reviews do not operate in a vacuum but within social structures that constrain what is visible and valued.

The empirical evidence is striking. Contesi, Chapman, and Sandis (2019) find that 97% of citations in elite analytic philosophy journals are to English-language work. Literature reviews drawing on these journals will mechanically reproduce this systematic exclusion of non-Anglophone philosophy. Leuschner (2019) documents that women philosophers submit work substantially less often due to indirect effects of social biases, meaning the corpus available for review already underrepresents women's contributions before any reviewer makes a single selection decision. De Bruin (2023) demonstrates that journal prestige hierarchies influence quality assessments -- authors rate their own journals higher than non-affiliated authors do -- suggesting that prestige functions as a self-reinforcing bias rather than an objective indicator.

These structural conditions compound. Heesen and Bright (2021) argue that prepublication peer review creates gatekeeping that may exclude valuable work, while Katzav and Vaesen (2017) show that increasingly stringent review processes may reduce philosophical pluralism by concentrating power in mainstream scholars. Laakso and Polonioli (2018) find that half of ethics publications remain behind paywalls, biasing literature reviews toward what reviewers at well-funded institutions can access. Lisciandra (2025) argues that citation metrics fail to "carve science at its joints," imposing external categories that distort field-specific differences. When literature reviewers use citation counts to identify "important" work, they amplify rather than correct these distortions.

The cumulative picture is clear: literature reviews are ethically consequential practices. They can enact epistemic injustice through biased citational choices, they reproduce canons constructed through exclusion, and they operate within social structures that systematically advantage some voices while marginalizing others. These ethical dimensions are not incidental to literature reviews but constitutive of them. What remains almost entirely absent is systematic work connecting these insights to the specific practice of writing literature reviews -- a gap this project addresses.
