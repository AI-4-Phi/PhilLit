## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the inquiry as a metaphilosophical investigation into a neglected scholarly practice, establish the central paradox, and preview the structure.

**Content**:
- Philosophy is a discipline defined by relentless self-examination -- it scrutinizes its own concepts, methods, and assumptions. Yet there is one practice that philosophy has largely failed to examine: the literature review itself. Every philosophical article positions itself within a tradition, surveys prior work, and selects which voices to include or exclude. These citational and synthetic acts are deeply consequential -- they reproduce canons, distribute epistemic recognition, and shape what counts as "the state of the art." But philosophers have produced almost no explicit theorizing about what makes a literature review good, what purposes it serves, or how it can go ethically wrong.
- This review synthesizes insights from seven domains -- metaphilosophy, review methodology, epistemic injustice, canon formation, hermeneutics, sociology of philosophy, and research ethics -- to construct an argument about the methodology and ethics of literature reviews in philosophy.
- The scarcity of direct literature on this topic (Domain 2 yielded only 6 papers, mostly from adjacent fields) is itself a central finding: philosophy's failure to theorize the literature review constitutes a significant blind spot.
- The review is organized around three questions: (1) What makes a good philosophical literature review? (2) What purposes do literature reviews serve? (3) Can literature reviews be ethically deficient? It argues that answers to these questions require integrating metaphilosophical, hermeneutic, and justice-oriented perspectives that are rarely brought together.

## Section 1: The Methodological Landscape -- Competing Conceptions of Philosophical Literature Engagement

**Section Purpose**: Establish that there is no settled methodology for philosophical literature reviews, because the question of how to review literature is parasitic on the deeper, contested question of what philosophy is and how it works. Different metaphilosophical commitments yield fundamentally different conceptions of what a literature review should accomplish.

**Main Claims**:
1. The methodology of literature reviews in philosophy is radically under-theorized: unlike medicine and the social sciences, philosophy has developed no explicit frameworks for conducting and evaluating reviews.
2. Different metaphilosophical positions (naturalism, hermeneutic historicism, methodological pluralism, decolonial critique) imply fundamentally different models for what a good literature review looks like -- and these implications have never been systematically drawn out.
3. The hermeneutic dimension of literature engagement -- how one reads, interprets, and represents others' views -- adds a layer of complexity absent from empirical review methodologies.

### Subsection 1.1: The Missing Genre -- Philosophy's Unreflective Review Practice

**Papers**: Grant and Booth (2009), Arksey and O'Malley (2005), Williamson (2007), Thomasson (2014), Shan (2022)
**Content**:
- Grant and Booth's typology of 14 review types provides a baseline from evidence-based practice: systematic reviews, scoping reviews, critical reviews, etc. The SALSA framework (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis, Analysis) offers a structural starting point.
- Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework -- with its emphasis on mapping key concepts, identifying gaps, and clarifying terminology -- maps more naturally onto philosophical practice than the systematic review's narrow hypothesis-testing model.
- However, both frameworks assume empirical research paradigms. Philosophy proceeds primarily through conceptual analysis, normative argument, and critical interpretation, not data collection. The translation problem is fundamental, not incidental.
- Domain 2's sparseness (only 6 papers found) is the critical evidence here: no work explicitly develops a methodology for philosophical literature reviews. This absence reveals that philosophers treat literature engagement as tacit knowledge transmitted through training, not as a methodological problem requiring explicit theorization.
**Gap Connection**: This absence motivates the entire project. The research addresses a lacuna that the profession has not recognized as such.

### Subsection 1.2: Metaphilosophical Foundations -- What Philosophy Is Determines How to Review Its Literature

**Papers**: Williamson (2007/2022), Cappelen et al. (2016), D'Oro and Overgaard (2017), Lewin (2021), Denecke (2024), Nado (2017), Shan (2022)
**Content**:
- Williamson's naturalistic anti-exceptionalism: if philosophy is continuous with science, literature reviews should survey philosophical "evidence" (including intuitions, thought experiments, and theoretical considerations) and assess competing theories, much as a scientific review assesses competing hypotheses. The implication is that philosophical literature is cumulative and that reviews track progress.
- Against this, the Cambridge Companion (D'Oro and Overgaard 2017) emphasizes that methodological choices reflect deeper metaphilosophical commitments: a phenomenologist's literature review differs fundamentally from an experimental philosopher's, because they disagree about what counts as evidence, what constitutes progress, and what the relevant literature even is.
- The Oxford Handbook (Cappelen et al. 2016) documents philosophical methodology as irreducibly plural -- the diversity of methods (conceptual analysis, formal methods, experimental philosophy, phenomenology) means there may be no single correct way to conduct a philosophical literature review.
- Lewin (2021) on Kant's metaphilosophy: the distinction between philosophy as activity and philosophy as system implies that literature engagement is not external to philosophical inquiry but constitutive of it -- one reviews literature not as a preliminary step but as part of the philosophical work itself.
- Denecke (2024) exposes the politics of this question: "what counts as philosophical literature?" cannot be answered without confronting the hegemony of Western philosophical canons. Current metaphilosophical assumptions about what philosophy is already determine whose work counts as "the literature."
- Nado (2017) offers a meta-methodological insight: prescriptive methodologies for reviews cannot be developed independently of examining how reviews actually function, but descriptive accounts alone do not vindicate existing practices. Both empirical investigation and normative reflection are needed.
**Gap Connection**: No existing work draws out the implications of metaphilosophical positions for literature review methodology -- a systematic analysis is needed.

### Subsection 1.3: The Hermeneutic Dimension -- Reading, Representing, and the Ethics of Interpretation

**Papers**: Davidson (2001), Lockard (2023), Vandevelde (2021), De Caro and Vaccarezza (2020), Lewinski (2012), Pagin (2013)
**Content**:
- A literature review does not merely list works but interprets and represents them. The principle of charity -- requiring that we attribute the strongest reasonable interpretation to others' positions -- provides a starting point, but its application is contested.
- Davidson's constitutive charity: charitable interpretation is not merely advisable but a precondition for understanding, because attributing massive error makes interpretation impossible. This would mean literature reviews must by default attribute rationality and coherence to the positions they survey.
- Vandevelde (2021) argues charity is both an epistemic and a moral virtue, not a mechanical principle. Representing others' views requires moral qualities of the interpreter, not just technical skill.
- De Caro and Vaccarezza (2020) develop "phronetic charity" -- context-sensitive interpretive judgment, not invariant rules. Literature reviews must adapt charitable reading to different subdisciplinary contexts.
- Lewinski (2012) identifies a fundamental paradox: charity to one side of a dispute often requires being uncharitable to the other. In multi-party debates, neutral charitable representation may be impossible. Literature reviews synthesizing competing positions face this paradox acutely.
- Lockard (2023) delivers the critical challenge: the "charitability gap" means charity is selectively applied -- demanded from marginalized scholars toward canonical figures while withheld from marginalized scholars' own work. Charitable reading, far from being a neutral virtue, can function as a mechanism of epistemic oppression when selectively deployed.
**Gap Connection**: The connection between hermeneutic theory and the specific practice of writing literature reviews remains almost entirely implicit. Lockard's critique raises the question of whether interpretive norms themselves need to be rethought for just scholarly practice.

**Section Summary**: There is no settled methodology for philosophical literature reviews because the underlying metaphilosophical questions -- what is philosophy, what constitutes philosophical evidence, how should we interpret others' work -- remain deeply contested. Different answers yield different review methodologies, and no existing work systematically maps these implications. The hermeneutic dimension adds further complexity: literature reviews are interpretive acts with ethical dimensions.

## Section 2: The Ethics of the Literature Review -- Injustice, Exclusion, and the Politics of Selection

**Section Purpose**: Argue that literature reviews are not ethically neutral but are sites where epistemic justice or injustice is enacted through citational choices, canonical reproduction, and structural gatekeeping. This section builds the case that literature reviews can be ethically deficient in specific, identifiable ways.

**Main Claims**:
1. Literature reviews enact epistemic injustice when they systematically exclude or misrepresent the work of marginalized scholars -- this is not merely a shortcoming in comprehensiveness but a distinctively epistemic wrong.
2. Canon formation mechanisms shape what counts as "the relevant literature" before any individual reviewer makes choices -- the ethics of literature reviews cannot be assessed without understanding the structural conditions that produce the available literature.
3. The sociology of philosophy reveals empirically measurable patterns of exclusion (gender, race, language, geography, prestige) that literature reviews reproduce when they uncritically follow existing citation networks.

### Subsection 2.1: Epistemic Injustice and Citational Practice

**Papers**: Fricker (2007), Dotson (2014), Medina (2012), Dadze-Arthur and Mangai (2024), Pratt and de Vries (2023), Davis (2016), Yuan and Peterson (2025), McKinnon (2016)
**Content**:
- Fricker's (2007) foundational framework: testimonial injustice (prejudice-based credibility deflation) and hermeneutical injustice (gaps in collective interpretive resources) are distinctively epistemic wrongs. Citation is a form of testimonial recognition: who gets cited, whose work is rendered invisible, whose perspectives are marginalized -- all reflect and reinforce epistemic injustice.
- Dotson's (2014) expansion to structural dimensions: contributory injustice occurs when marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to collective hermeneutical resources. This implicates literature reviews directly -- when reviewers systematically exclude work from marginalized scholars or alternative epistemologies, they enact contributory injustice. Medina's (2012) concepts of "active ignorance" and "meta-ignorance" (ignorance of one's ignorance) apply to reviewers who claim comprehensiveness while ignoring marginalized work.
- Dadze-Arthur and Mangai (2024) explicitly connect citation practices to the epistemic justice framework, identifying citational justice as a facet of testimonial justice.
- Pratt and de Vries (2023) demonstrate three layers of epistemic injustice in knowledge production: who produces knowledge, what theories are applied, and whose voices are sought. All three operate in literature reviews.
- Davis (2016) on credibility excess: simply increasing citation of marginalized scholars can perpetuate injustice if done in identity-reductive ways (citing women only on gender topics, scholars of color only on race). Tokenistic inclusion does not achieve citational justice.
- Yuan and Peterson (2025) argue that citation confers power and authority, making citational choices morally significant acts with consequences beyond knowledge transmission.
- Critical tension: Bruton et al. (2023), an empirical survey, finds that social justice-motivated citation is controversial among scholars. Many view intentionally citing underrepresented groups as ethically questionable "strategic citation." This reveals a genuine tension between traditional epistemic norms and citational justice demands that the review should not elide.
**Gap Connection**: Almost no work directly addresses how epistemic injustice operates specifically within the practice of literature reviewing (as opposed to citation generally). The application is obvious but has not been systematically developed.

### Subsection 2.2: Canon Formation and the Pre-Selection of "Relevant Literature"

**Papers**: Park (2013), Graness (2018), Connell and Janssen-Lauret (2016), Waithe (2015), Dhawan (2017), Grosfoguel (2013), Kim (2019), Shapiro (2022), Elkind (2023)
**Content**:
- Park (2013) documents how the modern Western philosophical canon was constructed through explicitly racist exclusions. What presents itself as "the history of philosophy" was deliberately narrowed to exclude African and Asian thought through racial arguments. This is not an accident to be corrected but a structural feature of the discipline.
- Graness (2018): writing a history of philosophy for African traditions requires "conceptual decolonisation" -- questioning the categories through which philosophy is defined. Literature reviews face the same challenge: deciding what counts as "philosophical literature" already enacts exclusions.
- Connell and Janssen-Lauret (2016): women who met all formal criteria for canonical status (published in major journals, held philosophy positions) were nevertheless excluded through evaluative labels ("bad philosophy," "derivative philosophy"). This shows that literature reviews' quality judgments can embed implicit bias.
- Waithe (2015): recovery work alone is insufficient because canon formation involves complex negotiations that cannot be bypassed by simply "adding" marginalized figures.
- Dhawan (2017): simply "including" non-Western traditions within existing philosophical frameworks reproduces the epistemic frameworks that enabled exclusion. The frameworks themselves must be decolonized.
- Grosfoguel (2013) on "epistemicide": the destruction of entire knowledge systems through colonialism shapes what is available to be reviewed. Literature reviews operate on a corpus that is already the product of epistemic violence.
- Elkind (2023) distinguishes "canon-menders," "canon-expanders," and "canon-shredders." The question for literature review methodology: is the goal to reform existing review practices (expand scope) or to fundamentally rethink what reviewing means?
- Shapiro (2022): changing what questions are asked transforms who counts as answering them. Literature reviews can transform canons by reframing central problems, not just expanding coverage.
**Gap Connection**: The relationship between canon formation and the practice of literature reviewing is rarely connected explicitly. These literatures develop in parallel but almost never intersect.

### Subsection 2.3: Structural Conditions -- What the Sociology of Philosophy Reveals

**Papers**: Heidegren and Lundberg (2010), Petrovich et al. (2024), Lisciandra (2025), de Bruin (2023), Contesi et al. (2019), Leuschner (2019), Heesen and Bright (2021), Katzav and Vaesen (2017), Laakso and Polonioli (2018)
**Content**:
- Heidegren and Lundberg (2010) establish the framework: philosophical knowledge production is socially situated practice. Literature reviews operate within social structures that constrain what is visible and valued.
- Contesi et al. (2019): 97% of citations in elite analytic philosophy journals are to English-language work. Literature reviews drawing on these journals will reproduce this systematic exclusion of non-Anglophone philosophy.
- Leuschner (2019): women philosophers submit work substantially less often due to indirect effects of social biases. The corpus available for review already underrepresents women's contributions.
- De Bruin (2023): journal prestige hierarchies influence what gets cited and reviewed. Institutional affiliations bias quality assessments -- authors rate their own journals higher.
- Lisciandra (2025): citation metrics fail to "carve science at its joints" -- they impose external categories that distort field-specific differences. Using citation counts to identify "important" literature amplifies existing biases.
- Petrovich et al. (2024): "mention extraction" reveals influence operates through multiple channels beyond formal citation. Literature reviewers implicitly make mention-based judgments about importance.
- Heesen and Bright (2021): prepublication peer review creates gatekeeping that may exclude valuable work, shaping the corpus available for review.
- Laakso and Polonioli (2018): half of ethics publications are behind paywalls. Literature reviews are biased toward what reviewers can access, favoring well-funded institutions.
- Katzav and Vaesen (2017): increasingly stringent peer review may reduce philosophical pluralism, concentrating power in mainstream scholars.
**Gap Connection**: No empirical study examines how literature reviews in philosophy are actually conducted -- what search strategies philosophers use, which sources they privilege, how they determine scope. The sociological work provides structural context but the practice itself remains unstudied.

**Section Summary**: Literature reviews are ethically consequential practices. They can enact epistemic injustice through biased citational choices, they reproduce canons constructed through exclusion, and they operate within social structures that systematically advantage some voices and marginalize others. These ethical dimensions are not incidental to literature reviews but constitutive of them.

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate the specific lacunae that the research project addresses, grounded in evidence from the preceding sections.

**Gap 1: No Explicit Methodology for Philosophical Literature Reviews**
- **Evidence**: Domain 2 yielded only 6 papers, none of which develops a methodology specifically for philosophy. Grant and Booth (2009) and Arksey and O'Malley (2005) are from health/social sciences. The metaphilosophy literature (Williamson 2007, Cappelen et al. 2016, D'Oro and Overgaard 2017) theorizes philosophical method extensively but never addresses the literature review as a distinct methodological practice.
- **Why it matters**: Without explicit methodology, literature review practices are transmitted tacitly through training and imitation, making them resistant to critical examination and improvement.
- **How the research addresses it**: The project provides the first systematic examination of what a good philosophical literature review would require, drawing on metaphilosophical, hermeneutic, and ethical resources.

**Gap 2: No Integration of Justice Frameworks with Review Methodology**
- **Evidence**: The epistemic injustice literature (Fricker 2007, Dotson 2014, Medina 2012) and citation ethics work (Dadze-Arthur and Mangai 2024) are well-developed but almost never applied to the specific practice of literature reviews. The canon formation literature (Park 2013, Graness 2018, Connell and Janssen-Lauret 2016) identifies exclusion mechanisms but does not connect them to review methodology. The hermeneutic literature on charity (Lockard 2023) critiques interpretive norms but does not address how these norms should guide literature synthesis.
- **Why it matters**: Without this integration, literature reviews remain a practice where ethical failures go unrecognized as such. Selective citation, canonical reproduction, and biased interpretation are treated as matters of scholarly judgment rather than potential injustices.
- **How the research addresses it**: By systematically connecting epistemic injustice, canon critique, and hermeneutic theory to the practice of literature reviewing, the project builds a normative framework for evaluating reviews along ethical dimensions.

**Gap 3: No Account of What Makes a Literature Review Ethically Bad**
- **Evidence**: The research ethics literature (Guenin 2005, Miller 2022, Byerly 2022) develops accounts of intellectual honesty and transparency but does not apply them to literature reviews specifically. Kubota (2019) and Burrell et al. (2022) critique knowledge production ethics but focus on research conduct broadly, not literature synthesis. Lockard (2023) identifies the "charitability gap" but does not develop a comprehensive account of interpretive ethics for reviews. The tension between epistemic norms and justice (revealed by Bruton et al. 2023) remains unresolved.
- **Why it matters**: If literature reviews can perpetuate epistemic injustice, reproduce exclusionary canons, and misrepresent positions through biased interpretation, then a normative account of what makes a review ethically deficient is urgently needed.
- **How the research addresses it**: The project develops an account of ethical failures in literature reviews organized around three categories: failures of inclusion (citational injustice), failures of representation (interpretive injustice), and failures of transparency (intellectual dishonesty about scope and limitations).

**Gap 4: No Empirical Investigation of Philosophical Review Practices**
- **Evidence**: The sociology of philosophy provides data on citation patterns (Petrovich et al. 2024, Contesi et al. 2019), journal prestige (de Bruin 2023), and gender disparities (Leuschner 2019), but no study examines how philosophical literature reviews are actually constructed -- what search strategies are used, how scope is determined, or what factors influence inclusion decisions.
- **Why it matters**: Without empirical baseline, normative prescriptions risk being disconnected from actual scholarly practice. As Nado (2017) argues, methodological reflection requires both descriptive and normative components.
- **How the research addresses it**: While primarily a theoretical contribution, the project identifies this empirical gap as a priority for future work and draws on available bibliometric data to ground its normative claims.

**Synthesis**: These four gaps collectively reveal that philosophy has failed to examine one of its most consequential scholarly practices. The research project addresses this by providing the first integrated account of the methodology and ethics of philosophical literature reviews, drawing on resources that already exist across multiple philosophical subdisciplines but have never been brought together for this purpose.

**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the argument, restate the central findings, and position the research project within the landscape.

**Content**:
- The review has shown that the philosophical literature review is a practice that is simultaneously ubiquitous and unexamined. Philosophy's relentless self-scrutiny has not extended to one of its most basic scholarly genres.
- Three key findings emerge. First, there is no settled methodology for philosophical literature reviews because the underlying metaphilosophical questions remain contested. Different conceptions of philosophy yield different review methodologies, and the hermeneutic dimension adds further complexity. Second, literature reviews are ethically consequential: they enact epistemic justice or injustice through citational choices, reproduce or contest canons built through exclusion, and operate within social structures that systematically shape whose work is visible and valued. Third, the existing literature provides rich but fragmented resources for addressing these questions -- from virtue epistemology (intellectual honesty and transparency) to structural critique (epistemological racism and epistemicide) to hermeneutic theory (the paradox of charity and the charitability gap).
- The research project fills a genuine gap by integrating these disparate literatures into a unified account of what makes a philosophical literature review good and what makes one ethically deficient.
- This matters beyond academic methodology: if literature reviews shape what counts as "the state of the art," determine which questions are taken to be open, and distribute epistemic recognition among scholars, then getting them right is not merely a matter of scholarly convenience but of epistemic justice.

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

**Total Word Target**: 3000-4000 words (aim for 3500)

**Citation Strategy**:
- Foundational must-cite: Fricker (2007), Davidson (2001), Grant and Booth (2009), Park (2013), Williamson (2007)
- Key recent papers: Lockard (2023), Denecke (2024), Dadze-Arthur and Mangai (2024), Lisciandra (2025), Petrovich et al. (2024)
- Papers providing critical tension: Bruton et al. (2023) on contested citation ethics, Lewinski (2012) on charity paradox, Elkind (2023) on canon-shredding, Nyamnjoh and Ewuoso (2023) on problems with inclusion

**Tone**: Analytical and argumentative, building the case that philosophy's failure to examine its own literature review practices constitutes a significant blind spot with methodological and ethical dimensions. The review should be self-aware about its own subject matter -- it is itself a literature review about literature reviews, and should acknowledge this reflexive position.

**Structural Notes**:
- The two main sections correspond roughly to (1) the methodological question (what makes a good review?) and (2) the ethical question (can reviews be unjust?), with the hermeneutic dimension bridging both.
- The purpose question (what are reviews for?) is addressed throughout rather than in a separate section -- different metaphilosophical positions assign different purposes to literature engagement.
- Objections and tensions should be integrated, not segregated. The Bruton et al. finding that social justice citation is controversial, Nyamnjoh and Ewuoso's critique of liberal inclusion, and Lewinski's charity paradox all represent genuine difficulties that the review should take seriously rather than dismiss.
- The Domain 2 sparseness finding should be foregrounded, not buried. It is arguably the review's most distinctive contribution: documenting and explaining philosophy's failure to theorize its own review practices.
