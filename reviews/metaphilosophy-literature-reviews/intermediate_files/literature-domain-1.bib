====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Metaphilosophy concerns the nature of philosophical inquiry itself, including
the methods philosophers use, the status of philosophical knowledge, and the
relationship between philosophy and other disciplines. This domain has seen
renewed interest in the 21st century, particularly through debates about
philosophical methodology, philosophical progress, and the diversity of
philosophical traditions. Major positions include: (1) Naturalistic approaches
that view philosophy as continuous with science (Williamson); (2) Conceptual
approaches emphasizing analysis and linguistic methods; (3) Pragmatist
approaches focused on the practical consequences of philosophical inquiry; and
(4) Pluralist approaches recognizing multiple valid methodologies and traditions.

Recent work (2022-2025) shows increased attention to global philosophy,
critiques of Eurocentrism in philosophical canons, and debates about ideal vs.
non-ideal theory. The question of philosophical progress remains contentious,
with some defending cumulative progress (Williamson, Lewin) and others
emphasizing historically situated, non-cumulative inquiry. Contemporary
metaphilosophy also grapples with the role of intuitions, experimental methods,
and the relationship between first-order philosophy and metaphilosophical
reflection.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the overarching framework for understanding how literature
reviews function in philosophy. If philosophy has distinctive methods that differ
from empirical sciences, then philosophical literature reviews must be understood
in light of those methods. The debates about philosophical progress, the role of
the literature, and different metaphilosophical positions (naturalism, pragmatism,
etc.) directly inform how we should conceive the methodology and ethics of
literature reviews in philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on philosophical methodology in general, there is
surprisingly little explicit reflection on the practice of literature review
itself in philosophy. The relationship between survey articles, overview entries
(SEP/IEP), and research monographs as forms of literature engagement is
under-theorized. Additionally, the differences between philosophical and
scientific literature reviews in terms of goals, methods, and epistemology
deserve more systematic attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should highlight how different metaphilosophical positions
yield different conceptions of what literature reviews should accomplish. It
should also trace the recent globalizing turn in metaphilosophy and its
implications for whose work counts as "the literature." Key tensions to explore
include progress vs. history-dependency, unity vs. plurality of method, and
first-order vs. second-order approaches to philosophy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Naturalist metaphilosophy (Williamson): 6 papers - Philosophy continuous with
  science, using similar methods and standards of progress
- Pragmatist metaphilosophy (Rescher): 3 papers - Philosophy evaluated by
  practical consequences and problem-solving effectiveness
- Historical/hermeneutic approaches: 4 papers - Philosophy as historically
  embedded, requiring attention to context and tradition
- Pluralist approaches (Lewin, Denecke): 3 papers - Multiple valid methodologies,
  recognition of diverse philosophical traditions
- Critical/decolonial approaches (Denecke, Utomo): 2 papers - Challenging
  Western hegemony, recognizing non-Western philosophical traditions

  CORE ARGUMENT: Philosophy is not fundamentally different from science in its methodology or epistemic status. Philosophical questions can be addressed through ordinary reasoning, observation, and theoretical inference, without appeal to special philosophical intuitions or a priori knowledge. Williamson defends a naturalistic conception of philosophy against approaches that treat it as conceptual analysis, linguistic investigation, or fundamentally distinct from empirical inquiry. He argues that philosophy makes progress through the accumulation of knowledge, similar to sciences, and that metaphilosophical reflection should itself be conducted as first-order philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This work establishes the most influential contemporary defense of naturalistic metaphilosophy. For understanding literature reviews in philosophy, Williamson's view implies that philosophical literature functions similarly to scientific literature: as a cumulative body of knowledge where later work builds on earlier results. His rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction and defense of philosophical progress has direct implications for how we conceive the relationship between a philosophical argument and the existing literature. If philosophy is continuous with science, then philosophical literature reviews should adopt similar methodological standards to scientific reviews.

  POSITION: Naturalistic, anti-exceptionalist metaphilosophy emphasizing continuity between philosophical and scientific inquiry.

  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199668779.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive handbook surveys the diverse methodologies employed in contemporary philosophy, including conceptual analysis, thought experiments, formal methods, experimental philosophy, and phenomenological approaches. The volume's editors and contributors collectively argue that philosophical methodology is heterogeneous, with different methods appropriate for different philosophical questions. The handbook covers both traditional methods (e.g., analysis, intuitions) and newer approaches (e.g., experimental philosophy, formal epistemology), showing both continuities and tensions between them.

  RELEVANCE: This handbook provides the most comprehensive recent survey of philosophical methods, making it essential for understanding the methodological landscape within which philosophical literature reviews operate. The diverse methods discussed (experimental, formal, phenomenological, conceptual) each imply different relationships to existing literature. For instance, experimental philosophy's empirical methods suggest a different role for literature than purely conceptual analysis. The handbook's pluralism about method directly informs questions about whether there can be a unified methodology for philosophical literature reviews or whether different subfields require different approaches.

  POSITION: Methodologically pluralist, surveying diverse approaches without advocating a single correct philosophical method.

  abstract = {Abstract This book examines the nature of philosophical methodology, defined as the study of philosophical method: how to do philosophy well. It considers a number of hypotheses that explain the nature of philosophical methodology, including eliminativism, epistemologism, theory selectionism, necessary preconditionalism, and hierarchicalism. It also tackles a range of topics such as ‘ordinary language philosophy’, the role of logic in philosophical methodology, phenomenology, philosophical heuristics, and methods in the philosophy of literature and film. Other chapters discuss the method of reflective equilibrium, the notions of conceivability and possibility, naturalistic approaches to philosophical methodology, the methodology of legal philosophy, aesthetics and the philosophy of art as branches of analytic philosophy, issues and methods in the philosophy of mathematics, how and whether faith conflicts with reason, and critical philosophy of race.},

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/9781316344118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This companion volume explores philosophical methodology from both analytic and continental perspectives, arguing that the divide between these traditions reflects different metaphilosophical commitments rather than simply different topics or styles. The volume emphasizes that methodological choices in philosophy are theory-laden and depend on prior commitments about the nature of philosophy itself. Contributors examine methods including phenomenology, hermeneutics, conceptual analysis, ordinary language philosophy, and naturalized epistemology, showing how each method embodies different assumptions about philosophical knowledge.

  RELEVANCE: Unlike the Oxford Handbook's survey approach, this volume explicitly thematizes the relationship between methodology and metaphilosophy, making it particularly relevant for understanding how different conceptions of philosophy yield different approaches to literature. The inclusion of both analytic and continental perspectives is crucial for a project examining literature reviews across philosophical traditions, as it highlights that what counts as "the relevant literature" depends on one's methodological orientation. The volume's attention to the theory-ladenness of method suggests that literature reviews cannot be methodologically neutral.

  POSITION: Pluralist but historically sensitive, emphasizing that methodological choices reflect deeper metaphilosophical commitments.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewin provides a systematic reconstruction of Kant's metaphilosophy, arguing that Kant developed an explicit account of philosophy's nature, aims, and methods. Kant distinguishes between philosophy as activity and philosophy as system, between the worldly concept and the scholastic concept of philosophy, and between philosophy as proper science and philosophy as idea. Lewin argues that Kant's critical project is fundamentally metaphilosophical: it investigates the conditions under which philosophy can be scientific. This analysis reveals eight elements of an "imperfect definition" of philosophy in Kant's work, including philosophy as an architectonic idea and reason as the absolute condition of philosophy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that metaphilosophical reflection has a distinguished historical pedigree and that Kant's critical philosophy centrally concerns the methodology of philosophy itself. For understanding literature reviews in philosophy, Kant's distinction between philosophy as activity and as system suggests that engaging with literature is not merely about surveying existing results but about participating in a distinctive form of rational activity. Kant's emphasis on systematic unity and architectonic structure implies that philosophical literature cannot be treated as a mere aggregation of results but must be understood in light of how individual contributions relate to systematic wholes.

  POSITION: Historical metaphilosophy showing that methodological reflection has been central to major philosophical projects.

In the first part of the article, I will introduce a demarcation criterion and show how scholars fall prey to the fallacy of extension confusing Kant’s philosophical theories with his theories about philosophy. In the second part, I will analyze eight elements for an “imperfect definition” (KrV A731/B759) of philosophy outlining the scope of Kant’s explicit metaphilosophy against the backdrop of recent metaphilosophical research: (i) scientific concept of philosophy, (ii) philosophy as an activity, (iii) worldly concept, (iv) philosophy as a (proper and improper) science, (v) philosophy as an architectonic idea (archetype and ectypes), (vi) philosophy as a social practice and the appropriate holding-to-be-true (one or many true philosophies?), (vii) reason as the absolute condition and subject of philosophy, and (viii) methodology of philosophy. I will put these elements together for an attempt to give an imperfect definition of philosophy – something that Kant promised but never did – in the conclusion.},

  volume = {9},
  pages = {45--64},
  doi = {10.1086/729074},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Denecke analyzes the current deadlock in efforts to globalize academic philosophy, identifying four problematic diversity paradigms ("The Same," "The Subaltern," "The Samaritan," and "The Area Studies Silo") that Western-style philosophers find either threatening or uninteresting. She argues that progress requires deep metaphilosophical reflection on what counts as philosophy across world history. By taking a "deeper historical and philological breath" to redraw where philosophy has thrived globally, we can develop a cosmopolitan future for academic philosophy that brings diverse philosophical practices to bear on contemporary global challenges.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the politics and ethics of what counts as "the philosophical literature" in an era of globalization. It argues that current approaches to diversity in philosophy fail because they operate within Western metaphilosophical assumptions about what philosophy is. For a project on literature reviews in philosophy, Denecke's analysis implies that the very question "what is the relevant literature?" cannot be answered without confronting the hegemony of Western philosophical canons and methods. Her call for metaphilosophical reflection as a prerequisite for genuine globalization suggests that literature review methodologies must themselves be reconceived to recognize diverse philosophical traditions.

  POSITION: Critical global philosophy, arguing for metaphilosophical reconstruction to enable genuine philosophical pluralism.

Second, it introduces a secret weapon nobody seems to have put to use yet: metaphilosophy. It argues that we need to take a deeper historical and philological breath to redraw what and where “philosophy” has thrived in world history. Only through the detour of a global, deep-time metaphilosophy can we bring the most ingenious human thought and philosophical practice to the table as we battle over a more cosmopolitan future for academic philosophy and try to forge philosophical tools to tackle the global challenges in our world of interlocking social, spiritual, and environmental crises.},

  doi = {10.1080/00048402.2024.2416976},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book (reviewed in the article) develops a systematic account of philosophical methodology structured around five questions: What is the structure of theoretical inquiry? What are the goals of philosophical inquiry? What are philosophical data? What is a sound method for philosophical theorizing? Has philosophical progress been made? The authors defend an epistemic theory of philosophical data (data are what inquirers collectively have good epistemic reason to believe) and propose the "Tri-Level Method" as a framework for philosophical theorizing that can facilitate understanding and explain philosophical progress.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides one of the most systematic recent attempts to articulate a unified philosophical methodology. The emphasis on philosophical data and the collective epistemic standing of the discipline is directly relevant to understanding how literature functions in philosophical inquiry: past philosophical work contributes to the collective body of data and reasons that constrain current theorizing. The defense of philosophical progress and the Tri-Level Method suggest that literature reviews in philosophy should track not just the history of positions but the accumulation of reasons and the refinement of theories over time.

  journal = {Metaphilosophy},
  year = {2022},
  doi = {10.1111/meta.12553},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This introduction to a special issue on metaphilosophy argues that recent years have seen increasing interest in metaphilosophical questions, driven by new approaches and methods in philosophy (digital philosophy of science, conceptual engineering, practice-based approaches to logic). The article identifies key metaphilosophical issues including philosophical progress, the aims of philosophy, naturalism, ordinary language philosophy, and the relationship between philosophical methods and their objects of study. It argues that examining philosophy's own methods and assumptions is essential to responsible philosophical practice.

  RELEVANCE: This recent overview of metaphilosophical debates provides a snapshot of contemporary concerns and new directions in the field. The emphasis on examining philosophy's own methods before doing philosophy connects directly to the project of understanding literature reviews: engaging with literature is itself a philosophical practice that requires methodological reflection. The mention of new methods (digital philosophy, conceptual engineering) suggests that technological and social changes may require rethinking traditional approaches to philosophical literature.

  doi = {10.5922/0207-6918-2023-3-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewin argues that both Kant's conception of philosophy and contemporary metaphilosophy deserve systematic attention and mutual illumination. Kant's direct analyses of philosophy's nature, aims, and methods address issues that constitute the research field of contemporary metaphilosophy: the taxonomy of philosophy, the relation between empirical and non-empirical philosophy, the relation between philosophy and its history, conceptual analysis, deductive reasoning, and philosophical disagreement. The article introduces debates about Kant's metaphilosophical value and argues for the continuing relevance of historical metaphilosophy to contemporary discussions.

  RELEVANCE: This introduction establishes historical continuity in metaphilosophical inquiry, showing that reflection on philosophical method is not a recent innovation but has deep roots in the canonical tradition. For understanding literature reviews, the emphasis on "the relation between philosophy and its history" is particularly significant: it suggests that engaging with the literature is not external to philosophical inquiry but integral to it. The attention to philosophical disagreement also connects to questions about how literature reviews should handle persistent philosophical controversies.

  title = {Metaphilosophy of Philosophical Turns: Case Study},
  journal = {Philosophy Journal},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.21146/2072-0726-2023-16-3-55-68},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using case studies of the analytical, linguistic, pragmatic, and ontological turns in 20th-century philosophy, Skripnik argues that philosophical "turns" are fundamentally changes in research methods that lead to new problem areas and subject matters. The analytical turn involved diversification of analysis methods; the linguistic turn changed methods of philosophical analysis, generating new problems in both philosophy and linguistics; the pragmatic turn used pragmatist methods to bridge analytic and continental philosophy; and the ontological turn shifted methods toward seeing things "as they really are" beyond multiculturalism to multi-naturalism.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of philosophical turns as methodological shifts has direct implications for understanding how philosophical literature evolves. It suggests that the relevant literature for a philosophical question changes not just through new arguments on the same topic, but through methodological innovations that reframe what counts as relevant. For literature review methodology, this implies that reviews must be sensitive to how different methodological paradigms constitute different bodies of "relevant" literature, and how methodological turns can make previously separate literatures suddenly relevant to each other.

  POSITION: Descriptive metaphilosophy analyzing the structure and dynamics of philosophical change through methodological innovation.

  keywords = {metaphilosophy, philosophical-turns, methods, Medium},
  abstract = {The purpose of the article is to consider the phenomenon of philosophical “turn” in the framework of descriptive metaphilosophy. Using the example of analytical, linguis­tic, pragmatic and ontological turns, an attempt is made to highlight the characteristic fea­tures of “turns”. The author shows that the analytical turn is associated with the develop­ment of methods of philosophy, primarily with the diversification of the concept of analy­sis itself. Consideration of the linguistic turn leads to the position that its characterization as a change in the subject of philosophy is not quite adequate – in fact, it is a change in the methods of philosophical analysis, which leads to the emergence of new problem areas not only in philosophy, but also in linguistics. The pragmatic turn is characterized by emphasizing the role of pragmatism in overcoming the existing opposition of analytic and continental philosophy through the use of both logical and, for example, axiological methods or the “pragmatic principle”. The ontological turn, characteristic of anthropol­ogy, the philosophy of technology, as well as for “general” philosophy, is associated with a change in the methods of analysis in the direction of solving the problem of seeing “things in a new way” and how “they really are”. The analysis in the case of an ontologi­cal turn is aimed not so much at “multiculturalism” as at “multi-naturalism”, at taking into account the active role of the subject and building the research models capable of taking this into account. The final position of the author is that according to which a “turn” is a change in research methods that leads to the formation of a new subject area and the formulation of new problems. They, in turn, stimulate the next “turn” and the de­velopment of new methods and methodologies.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: In this wide-ranging interview, Groff discusses her intellectual development as a realist philosopher, her role as a community organizer in philosophy, and her relationship to critical realism. She addresses the nature and legacy of positivism, the concept of falsehood, realism about causal powers, mind-independent reality, the history of philosophy, and the role of ideology-critique in philosophical inquiry. Groff argues that philosophical inquiry is never ideologically neutral and that examining the social and political dimensions of philosophical positions is itself a form of philosophical work.

  RELEVANCE: This interview articulates a critical realist metaphilosophy that emphasizes philosophy's political dimensions and its role in ideology-critique. For literature review methodology, this perspective suggests that reviewing existing literature is not a neutral scholarly exercise but involves political and ethical decisions about which voices to center, which problems to take seriously, and which forms of knowledge to recognize. The emphasis on positivism's legacy also highlights how past methodological commitments continue to shape what counts as legitimate philosophical work and thus what enters the literature.

  doi = {10.1017/9781108993937},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Clarke-Doane examines the problem of mathematical knowledge and its implications for metaphilosophy. He argues that the challenge to explain mathematical knowledge arises from disagreement over mathematical axioms that bottoms out in disagreement over intuitions (the justificatory challenge) and from the modal fact that we could easily have had different mathematical beliefs (the reliability challenge). He argues that mathematical facts might be so plentiful that our knowledge of them is unmysterious, and extends this pluralism to modality, logic, and normative theory. This metaphilosophical pluralism has surprising implications: metaphysically it engenders perspectivalism and indeterminacy, while methodologically it vindicates Carnapian pragmatism.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on mathematics, this work has direct implications for philosophical methodology more broadly. The argument that philosophical disagreements often bottom out in disagreements over intuitions connects to debates about the role of intuitions in philosophical method. The defense of pluralism across multiple domains (mathematics, modality, logic, normative theory) suggests that philosophical literature will exhibit deep disagreements that cannot be resolved by appeal to shared data or methods. For literature review methodology, this implies that reviews cannot aim for convergence on truth but must acknowledge legitimate pluralism.

  POSITION: Metaphilosophical pluralism extending from philosophy of mathematics to modality, logic, and ethics.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Nado addresses how to think about debates in philosophical methodology, particularly in light of challenges from experimental philosophy. She argues that metaphilosophical debates should not be understood as purely empirical questions about how philosophers actually reason, nor as purely normative questions about how philosophers should reason in isolation from actual practice. Instead, methodological debates involve both descriptive and normative elements in complex interaction. Understanding actual philosophical practice is necessary for evaluating proposed methodologies, but empirical findings alone cannot settle methodological questions.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses the methodology of metaphilosophy itself, providing a framework for thinking about methodological debates. For literature review methodology, it suggests that prescriptive methodologies for conducting reviews cannot be developed independently of examining how philosophical literature reviews actually function in practice. At the same time, descriptive accounts of existing review practices do not automatically vindicate those practices. This implies that developing a methodology for philosophical literature reviews requires both empirical investigation of actual practices and normative reflection on their justification.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schmid examines how Kant, Salomon Maimon, and F.W.J. Schelling developed distinctive methods for philosophizing about philosophy itself. The book argues that these German Idealist philosophers recognized that metaphilosophy requires distinctive methods because of its special object: philosophy itself. The investigation proceeds by examining how these thinkers engaged with 18th-century scientific theories and practices, showing that philosophical experiments, fictions, and models offer methodological solutions to the problem of developing a scientific metaphysics. The book demonstrates that metaphilosophical reflection has a sophisticated methodological history.

  RELEVANCE: This historical study shows that the problem of how to conduct metaphilosophical inquiry (including inquiry into philosophical methods) has a rich intellectual tradition. For literature review methodology, it suggests that reflecting on how to review philosophical literature is itself a metaphilosophical question requiring appropriate methods. The emphasis on how German Idealists drew on scientific practices of their era to develop philosophical methods suggests that contemporary literature review methodologies might similarly benefit from engaging with current scholarly practices in adjacent fields while maintaining awareness of philosophy's distinctive character.

What unites their projects is the thesis that philosophy must begin with an investigation of its own nature, and that this investigation, because of its special object, must be accompanied by a reflection on its method. To this end, their methods are discussed on the assumption that these methods arise from a particular engagement with the theories and practices of the 18th century sciences.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reinoso argues against the interpretation of Neopyrrhonism (linking Wittgenstein and ancient Pyrrhonian skepticism) as a quietist metaphilosophy that cancels philosophy through self-destructive arguments. Instead, she proposes interpreting Neopyrrhonism as a performative metaphilosophy that is an open-ended inquiry using different philosophical argumentative strategies to encourage new ways of practicing philosophy. This non-quietist Neopyrrhonism involves skepticism about philosophy based on philosophical arguments, but does not conclude that philosophy should cease; rather, it transforms how philosophy is done.

  RELEVANCE: This article offers an alternative metaphilosophical position that is skeptical about traditional philosophical methods while remaining engaged in philosophical inquiry. For literature review methodology, a Neopyrrhonist approach would emphasize examining the arguments and presuppositions in the literature rather than accepting them, using the literature performatively to generate new philosophical questions. This contrasts with approaches that treat the literature as a body of established results to build upon. The distinction between quietist and non-quietist metaphilosophy also maps onto different possible attitudes toward philosophical literature: accepting its authority vs. subjecting it to ongoing critical scrutiny.

  POSITION: Skeptical but non-quietist metaphilosophy emphasizing performative and critical engagement with philosophy.

  abstract = {Fogelin (2002 [1976]; 1992 [1981]; 1994) was the first one to speak about “Neopyrrhonism” to link Wittgenstein and Sextus Empiricus. To him, Pyrrhonism “combines philosophical scepticism with scepticism about philosophy, that is, to have doubts about philosophy on the basis of philosophical arguments” (1994, p. 3). Following this interpretation, Neopyrrhonism can be understood as a kind of scepticism that cancels philosophy using self-destructive arguments (peritrope). Both Sextus -with his proposal of suspension of judgment- and Wittgenstein -with his idea of the dissolution of philosophical problems- are representatives of quietism. Neopyrrhonism as quietism can be conceived of as a therapeutic proposal mainly based on not postulating an argumentative-constructive philosophical theory. Against this perspective, I propose interpreting Neopyrrhonism as Metaphilosophy, from which a performative proposal emerges. In this approach, Neopyrrhonism is an open-ended inquiry that implies the ability of using different philosophical argumentative strategies in a performative sense to encourage a new way of exercising philosophy. },

  journal = {European Journal of Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/ejop.13038},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Yetman argues that Conceptual Metaphor Theory's (CMT) critique of philosophy—that philosophical concepts and arguments rely on unacknowledged metaphorical structures that can lead philosophy astray—was anticipated by Wittgenstein and his student Margaret MacDonald. Wittgenstein's method of identifying and resolving philosophical puzzles generated by misused grammatical analogies, and MacDonald's analysis of how and why such analogies create problems, both prefigure CMT's claims about metaphor in philosophy. Yetman supplements these historical figures' diagnoses with evidence from CMT showing that linguistic metaphors often originate in deeper cognitive mappings.

  RELEVANCE: This article addresses how metaphors and analogies function in philosophical reasoning, with implications for how we read philosophical literature. If philosophical arguments often rely on implicit metaphorical structures, then understanding a piece of philosophical literature requires identifying these structures. For literature review methodology, this suggests that reviews should attend not just to explicit arguments but to the metaphors and analogies that structure philosophical discourse. It also implies that different philosophical traditions may employ different root metaphors, making cross-traditional literature reviews particularly challenging.

  POSITION: Critical metaphilosophy examining the role of metaphor and analogy in philosophical method and argumentation.

  abstract = {The discipline of philosophy has been critiqued from both within and outside itself. One brand of external critique is associated with Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), the view that human cognition is partially structured by pervasive and automatic mappings between conceptual domains. Most notably, Lakoff and Johnson (1999) claimed that many central philosophical concepts and arguments rely on an unacknowledged metaphorical substructure, and that this structure has sometimes led philosophy astray. The purpose of this paper is to argue that Lakoff and Johnson's critique is anticipated by the work of post‐Tractarian Wittgenstein and his student, Margaret MacDonald. In the Blue Book, Wittgenstein outlines a method for identifying and resolving philosophical puzzles generated by misused grammatical analogies, although his discussion lacks a precise characterization of exactly how and why such analogies lead to trouble. In a 1938 paper, MacDonald offers such a characterization, which I outline and then connect back to Wittgenstein. In addition to this interpretive work, I supplement Wittgenstein and MacDonald's diagnosis using evidence from CMT which suggests that linguistic metaphors and analogies often originate in or are motivated by more fundamental analogical mappings in cognition. The supplemented account carries implications for how philosophical arguments ought to be formulated and critiqued.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pati examines what it means to speak of a "Hegelian metaphilosophy" and assesses Hegel's relevance for contemporary metaphilosophical debates. He argues that Hegel developed a distinctive conception of philosophy as the self-conscious comprehension of its own historical development, where philosophy is both historically situated and capable of grasping its own historicity. This Hegelian metaphilosophy offers resources for contemporary debates about philosophical progress, the relationship between philosophy and its history, and the possibility of overcoming philosophical disagreements through dialectical development.

  RELEVANCE: Hegel's metaphilosophy offers a distinctive account of how philosophical inquiry relates to its own history—neither treating the history of philosophy as mere preparatory material (as in cumulative progress models) nor as historically relative with no trans-historical standards (as in radical historicism). For literature review methodology, a Hegelian approach would emphasize understanding how current philosophical questions emerge from the internal development of past philosophical positions, requiring literature reviews to reconstruct this dialectical development rather than simply cataloging positions. This contrasts with both naturalistic and purely historical approaches.

  POSITION: Hegelian-historicist metaphilosophy emphasizing philosophy's self-conscious relation to its own history.

In recent years, many studies on the relationship between G. W. F. Hegel and metaphilosophy have appeared, articulating it in various ways. The goal of this paper is to specify in what sense it is possible to speak of a Hegelian metaphilosophy, while also assessing the relevance of Hegel for the current metaphilosophical debate. In particular, I will proceed as follows. First, I will outline the main features of the contemporary metaphilosophical debate. Second, I will discuss some important metaphilosophical interpretations of Hegel. Third, I will specify in what sense it is possible to speak of a Hegelian metaphilosophy. Fourth, I will address several methodological issues that arise whenever one attempts to assert the contemporary relevance of Hegel’s philosophy. Finally, I will assess to what extent Hegel’s philosophy can be relevant for the current metaphilosophical debate. As a result, the present paper outlines a concrete option for current philosophical research.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This article critically examines how Western philosophy constructs epistemic hegemony through historical narratives (linear progress from Greece to modernity), methodological standards (logical-deductive methods as prerequisites for philosophical validity), and terminology (Greek-Latin vocabulary as necessary for philosophical discourse). These mechanisms systematically exclude non-Western thought (exemplified by Confucianism and Daoism) from recognition as philosophy. The authors propose "dialogical exclusive multiplicity" as an alternative framework that recognizes non-Western traditions as autonomous and equal rather than requiring them to conform to Western philosophical categories.

  RELEVANCE: This article directly addresses power dynamics in defining what counts as philosophy and thus what counts as philosophical literature. For literature review methodology, it exposes how seemingly neutral methodological choices (what sources to include, what languages to prioritize, what standards of argument to apply) can reproduce epistemic hegemony. The proposal for "dialogical exclusive multiplicity" suggests that philosophical literature reviews should not force non-Western traditions into Western frameworks but should recognize multiple autonomous philosophical traditions, each with their own internal standards and development.

  POSITION: Decolonial metaphilosophy critiquing Western philosophical hegemony and advocating for epistemic pluralism.

  abstract = {This study critically examines how Western philosophy constructs epistemic hegemony through historical, methodological, and terminological mechanisms, and explores how non-Western traditions such as Confucianism and Daoism can be recognized as complete and authentic without undergoing conceptual subordination. This research is significant as the discourse of global philosophy remains dominated by Western epistemic structures that limit the plurality of rational forms. Employing a qualitative, literature-based approach, this study analyzes key metaphilosophical texts, Jacques Derrida’s theory of deconstruction, and Alain Badiou’s ontology as conceptual tools to trace power relations embedded in the definitions and boundaries of philosophy. The findings reveal that Western philosophy has institutionalized a linear historical narrative, logical-deductive methodological standards, and a Greek-Latin vocabulary as prerequisites for philosophical validity—resulting in the systematic exclusion of non-Western thought. The study further proposes a conceptual framework of dialogical exclusive multiplicity as an alternative for recognizing truth procedures in non-Western traditions as autonomous and equal. The implications of this research open avenues for deconstructing philosophy as the sole legitimate mode of thinking and promote the formation of a more epistemically just global philosophical ecosystem. The originality of this study lies in its critical synthesis of metaphilosophy, deconstruction, and contemporary ontology to construct an alternative paradigm for cross-traditional philosophical inquiry—one based not on inclusion, but on recognition and articulative equality.

  title = {Pure and Impure Philosophy in Kant's Metaphilosophy},
  journal = {Kantian journal},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.5922/0207-6918-2023-3-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Garcia explores the distinction between "pure" and "impure" (applied, empirical) philosophy in Kant's system, examining four areas: pure vs. applied logic, rational vs. empirical psychology, pure metaphysics of nature vs. physics, and pure morality vs. moral anthropology. He argues that impure philosophy is not inferior or non-philosophical for Kant, but is instrumentally valuable and constitutes an indispensable part of Kant's philosophy in both theoretical and practical senses. This challenges interpretations that see Kant as exclusively concerned with pure philosophical inquiry.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between pure and impure philosophy raises questions about what kinds of considerations belong in philosophical inquiry and thus what literature is relevant. If philosophy properly includes empirical elements (impure philosophy), then philosophical literature reviews might need to engage with empirical research more extensively than if philosophy is purely a priori. For understanding philosophical methodology, Garcia's analysis suggests that different areas of philosophy may have different relationships to empirical inquiry and thus different methodologies for engaging with literature.

  POSITION: Kantian metaphilosophy emphasizing the complementary roles of pure and impure philosophical inquiry.

  abstract = {Kant’s metaphilosophy has three main parts: (1) an essentialist project (“What is philosophy?”); (2) a methodological project (“How do we do philosophy?”); and (3) a taxonomic project (“What are the different parts of philosophy, and how are they related?”). This paper focuses on the third project. In particular, it explores one of the most intriguing yet puzzling aspects of Kant’s philosophy, viz. the relationship between what Kant calls ‘pure’ philosophy vs. ‘applied’, ‘empirical’ or what we can broadly refer to as ‘impure’ philosophy. (As we shall see, in order to be able to address this third project, we shall also need to examine the other two projects in detail.) My plan is as follows. First, I discuss four main areas of pure vs. impure philosophy: (i) ‘pure logic’ vs. ‘applied logic’; (ii) ‘rational psychology’ vs. ‘empirical psychology’; (iii) ‘pure metaphysics of nature’ vs. ‘physics’ and (iv) ‘pure morality’ or a ‘metaphysics of morals’ vs. ‘moral anthropology’, ‘practical anthropology’ or ‘applied moral philosophy’. Based on this, I identify four key differences between pure and impure philosophy. Second, I critically examine four different readings of Kant’s views about the status of ‘impure’ philosophy: (a) that it is not genuine philosophy; (b) that it is bad or inferior philosophy; (c) that it is instrumentally valuable; and (d) that it constitutes an indispensable part of Kant’s philosophy, both in a theoretical and practical sense. I argue that Kant is best interpreted as endorsing readings (c) and (d). Third, I offer some concluding remarks.},
