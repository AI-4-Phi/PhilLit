DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the ethical norms and responsibilities governing scholarly
practice in philosophy and the humanities, with particular focus on intellectual
honesty, research integrity, and the ethics of knowledge production. While biomedical
research ethics is well-established, scholarship on research ethics specific to the
humanities remains underdeveloped. Key debates include: What obligations do scholars
have regarding comprehensive literature engagement? How does intellectual honesty
function as an epistemic virtue? What are the ethics of selective citation and
omission in scholarship? Recent work has expanded beyond individual misconduct
(plagiarism, fabrication) to examine structural issues like epistemological racism,
power dynamics in knowledge production, and the responsibilities of scholarly
communication. Christian Miller and T. Ryan Byerly have developed accounts of
intellectual honesty as a virtue, while Ryuko Kubota and others critique how
hegemonic knowledge systems marginalize scholars from the Global South and women of
color. The field increasingly recognizes that research ethics involves not just
following procedural rules but cultivating intellectual virtues and addressing
systemic inequities in knowledge production.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the normative foundations of literature review
methodology. If comprehensive literature engagement is an ethical obligation, what
grounds this duty? The intellectual honesty literature provides virtue-theoretic
frameworks for understanding scholars' responsibilities regarding truth-telling,
citation practices, and acknowledgment of limitations. The epistemological racism
and knowledge production critiques reveal how literature review practices can
perpetuate inequities by privileging certain voices and marginalizing others. This
domain thus provides essential normative resources for evaluating whether selective
literature engagement constitutes ethical scholarship.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers explicitly address the ethics of literature reviews or comprehensive
literature engagement as a specific scholarly practice. Most work focuses on
misconduct (plagiarism) or broad issues in knowledge production. There is limited
philosophical analysis of what makes citation practices ethically justified or how
intellectual honesty applies specifically to literature synthesis. The connection
between intellectual virtues and concrete research practices remains undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should connect virtue epistemology (intellectual honesty, transparency)
with structural critiques of knowledge production (epistemological racism, power
dynamics). Consider how individual-level virtues and systemic-level critiques
complement or tension with each other. Explore whether intellectual honesty provides
sufficient normative resources for evaluating literature review practices or whether
additional principles (justice, care, solidarity) are needed.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Virtue-theoretic approaches: 5 papers - Intellectual honesty/transparency as
  epistemic virtues (Guenin, Miller, Byerly, King, Baehr)
- Structural/critical approaches: 3 papers - Epistemological racism and power in
  knowledge production (Kubota, Burrell et al., Luchies)
- Research integrity frameworks: 2 papers - Scholarly record correction and academic
  integrity (Dougherty, Khamitov)

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Guenin develops a Kantian account of intellectual honesty as an
  exceptionless duty of nondeceptiveness in scholarly communication. Intellectual
  honesty requires not only avoiding false assertions but also refraining from
  deception through implicature, omission, equivocation, and sophistry that affect
  listeners' doxastic states. The kernel of intellectual honesty is a virtuous
  disposition such that when presented with an incentive to deceive, the agent will
  not deceive. For scholarship, this duty is exceptionless—there are no legitimate
  exceptions that would permit scholarly deception.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethics of omission in scholarship and provides
  the most rigorous philosophical account of intellectual honesty's demands.
  Guenin's analysis of deception through omission is crucial for evaluating whether
  selective literature engagement constitutes intellectual dishonesty. His claim
  that the duty is exceptionless in scholarship raises the question: does failing
  to engage with relevant literature constitute deception by omission? This provides
  a strong normative framework for literature review ethics.

  POSITION: Deontological/virtue-theoretic account of intellectual honesty as
  exceptionless duty in scholarship; focuses on preventing deception rather than
  promoting positive epistemic goods.

  volume = {10},
  number = {2},
  pages = {83--98},
  doi = {10.12775/setf.2022.021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miller offers a preliminary account of intellectual honesty focused
  on its behavioral and motivational dimensions. The intellectually honest person
  reliably does not intentionally distort the facts as she takes them to be,
  motivated by intellectually virtuous reasons (truth-seeking, intellectual
  excellence, respect for others as epistemic agents). Miller distinguishes
  intellectual honesty from moral honesty and emphasizes that it involves both
  behavioral patterns (not distorting facts) and characteristic motivations (valuing
  truth and understanding).

  RELEVANCE: Provides a more recent and accessible account of intellectual honesty
  than Guenin, focusing on virtue rather than duty. Miller's emphasis on not
  intentionally distorting facts raises questions about how selective literature
  engagement relates to distortion—does omitting relevant work distort the
  scholarly record? His focus on motivation is important for understanding whether
  literature review practices reflect genuine commitment to truth or are driven by
  other motives (efficiency, confirmation bias, competitive advantage).

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account emphasizing behavioral dispositions and
  intellectually virtuous motivations; focuses on avoiding intentional distortion of
  facts.

  abstract = {Until recently, almost nothing had been written about the moral virtue of honesty in the past 50 years of Western analytic philosophy. Slowly, this is beginning to change. But moral honesty is not the only kind of honesty there is. In this paper, I focus specifically on the intellectual cousin to moral honesty, and offer a preliminary account of its behavioral and motivational dimensions. The account will be centered on not intentionally distorting the facts as the person takes them to be, for one of a variety of intellectually virtuous motivating reasons.},

@article{byerly2022intellectual,
  author = {Byerly, T. Ryan},
  title = {Intellectual Honesty and Intellectual Transparency},
  journal = {Episteme},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {20},
  number = {2},
  pages = {410--428},
  doi = {10.1017/epi.2021.54},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Byerly examines the relationship between intellectual honesty (as
  developed by Nathan King adapting Christian Miller's work) and intellectual
  transparency (Byerly's own account). Intellectual transparency involves openly
  sharing one's intellectual states, processes, and limitations with others in ways
  that facilitate mutual understanding and epistemic cooperation. Byerly argues that
  intellectual transparency can be understood either as an exceptionally strong
  variety of intellectual honesty or as a distinct but related cardinal virtue.
  Transparency goes beyond honesty by requiring positive disclosure rather than
  merely avoiding deception.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between honesty and transparency is crucial for
  literature review ethics. While intellectual honesty might only prohibit
  misrepresenting what one has read, intellectual transparency would require
  disclosing what one has not read or what limitations exist in one's literature
  coverage. Byerly's account suggests that responsible scholarship may require not
  just avoiding deception but actively revealing gaps and limitations in one's
  knowledge. This has direct implications for how scholars should acknowledge the
  scope and boundaries of their literature reviews.

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account distinguishing intellectual honesty (avoiding
  deception) from intellectual transparency (positive disclosure); suggests
  transparency may be a more demanding virtue.

  abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of intellectually virtuous honesty, by examining the relationship between a recent account of intellectual honesty and a recent account of intellectual transparency. The account of intellectual honesty comes from Nathan King, who adapts the work of Christian Miller on moral honesty, while the account of intellectual transparency comes from T. Ryan Byerly. After introducing the respective accounts, I identify four potential differences between intellectual honesty and intellectual transparency as understood by these accounts. I then turn to the question of how to think about the relationship between these traits in light of these potential differences. I make the case that intellectual transparency can either be regarded as an exceptionally strong or ideal variety of intellectual honesty, or it can be regarded as a distinct virtue from intellectual honesty which is a more cardinal virtue than the latter. Along the way, I also note some places where a case can be made that Miller's and King's accounts of honesty and intellectual honesty are in need of refinement or clarification.},

  journal = {Synthese},
  year = 2014,
  volume = {191},
  number = {15},
  pages = {3501--3523},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-014-0418-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: King develops an account of intellectual perseverance as a virtue,
  distinct from but related to other intellectual virtues like conscientiousness,
  honesty, courage, and open-mindedness. Intellectual perseverance involves
  sustained engagement with difficult intellectual tasks despite obstacles,
  setbacks, and temptations to give up. King argues that intellectual perseverance
  is valuable both instrumentally (it helps achieve truth) and constitutively (it
  reflects proper valuation of intellectual goods).

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about honesty or integrity, King's analysis of
  intellectual perseverance connects to literature review ethics in important ways.
  Comprehensive literature engagement requires perseverance—the willingness to
  continue searching, reading, and synthesizing even when it becomes tedious or
  overwhelming. King's work suggests that virtuous scholarship involves not just
  avoiding dishonesty but also cultivating the stamina to pursue thorough
  understanding. This virtue-theoretic framework complements duty-based accounts by
  highlighting the dispositional qualities that enable responsible scholarship.

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic account of intellectual perseverance as essential for
  sustained inquiry; complements other intellectual virtues in enabling good
  scholarship.

@article{baehr2013educating,
  author = {Baehr, Jason},
  title = {Educating for Intellectual Virtues: From Theory to Practice},
  journal = {Journal of Philosophy of Education},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {47},
  number = {2},
  pages = {248--262},
  doi = {10.1111/1467-9752.12023},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Baehr argues that intellectual virtues (including curiosity,
  open-mindedness, intellectual courage, intellectual honesty, and attentiveness)
  should be central aims of education. He distinguishes reliabilist conceptions of
  intellectual virtue (stable cognitive faculties) from responsibilist conceptions
  (character traits like the ones listed). Baehr advocates for the responsibilist
  approach and outlines how intellectual virtue education can be implemented in
  practice through modeling, direct instruction, and creating supportive
  institutional cultures.

  RELEVANCE: Baehr's work on intellectual virtue education provides a framework for
  understanding how scholarly norms and practices are transmitted through training
  and pedagogy. If intellectual virtues are cultivated through education and
  institutional culture, then research ethics in the humanities depends partly on
  how graduate programs and disciplinary communities socialize scholars. This
  connects to the project's questions about the role of training in shaping citation
  and review practices—are comprehensive literature reviews a matter of individual
  virtue, institutional norms, or both?

  POSITION: Responsibilist virtue epistemology applied to education; emphasizes
  character-based intellectual virtues and their pedagogical cultivation.

@article{kubota2019confronting,
  author = {Kubota, Ryuko},
  title = {Confronting Epistemological Racism, Decolonizing Scholarly Knowledge: Race and Gender in Applied Linguistics},
  journal = {Applied Linguistics},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {41},
  number = {5},
  pages = {712--732},
  doi = {10.1093/applin/amz033},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kubota critiques epistemological racism—how racial inequalities
  shape knowledge production and consumption in academe, marginalizing scholarship
  by Global South scholars and women of color. Neoliberal academic competition
  compels scholars of color to become complicit with white Euro-American hegemonic
  knowledge, further perpetuating this hegemony. Kubota argues that epistemological
  antiracism requires validating alternative theories, rethinking citation practices,
  and developing critical reflexivity and accountability. Simply valorizing
  non-European knowledge risks essentialism and overlooking male hegemony; instead,
  black feminist ethics emphasizes personal ethical commitment to antiracism.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamentally challenges the assumption that literature review practices
  are neutral or purely epistemic. Kubota demonstrates how citation practices
  reproduce racial and gender hierarchies by privileging certain voices and
  marginalizing others. This raises critical questions for the project: Do norms of
  "comprehensive" literature review actually privilege Euro-American scholarship?
  How should scholars balance comprehensiveness with actively seeking out
  marginalized voices? Kubota suggests that responsible scholarship requires
  critical reflexivity about whose knowledge is cited and valued, not just formal
  completeness.

  POSITION: Critical/feminist epistemology analyzing how race and gender shape
  knowledge production; emphasizes structural barriers and need for antiracist
  citation practices.
  },
  keywords = {epistemological-racism, knowledge-production, citation-practices, feminism, antiracism, High},
  abstract = {
  abstract_source = {s2},
 Recent scholarship in sociolinguistics and language education has examined how race and language intersect each other and how racism influences linguistic and educational practices. While racism is often conceptualized in terms of individual and institutional injustices, a critical examination of another form of racism—epistemological racism—problematizes how racial inequalities influence our knowledge production and consumption in academe. Highlighting the importance of the intersectional nature of identity categories, this conceptual article aims to draw scholars’ attention on how epistemological racism marginalizes and erases the knowledge produced by scholars in the Global South, women scholars of color, and other minoritized groups. In today’s neoliberal culture of competition, scholars of color are compelled to become complicit with white Euro-American hegemonic knowledge, further perpetuating the hegemony of white knowledge while marginalizing women scholars of color. Valorizing non-European knowledge and collectivity as an alternative framework also risks essentialism and male hegemony. Conversely, the ethics promoted by black feminism emphasizes a personal ethical commitment to antiracism. Epistemological antiracism invites scholars to validate alternative theories, rethink our citation practices, and develop critical reflexivity and accountability.},

  number = {3},
  pages = {917--940},
  doi = {10.1007/s10551-022-05243-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This collaborative essay examines how questions of who produces
  knowledge, what knowledge is produced, and how it is produced are inherently
  ethical and political, not merely technical. The authors argue that the ethical
  responsibility of academic knowledge production goes far beyond conventions around
  research integrity and extends to challenging systemic inequities, power
  structures, and dominant paradigms. They call for greater reflexivity about how
  journal editorial practices, citation networks, and theoretical frameworks shape
  what counts as legitimate knowledge and who counts as a legitimate knower.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethics of academic knowledge production at
  structural and institutional levels. The paper's emphasis on journal editing and
  publication practices connects to literature review ethics—what gets reviewed and
  cited is shaped by what gets published and legitimated. The authors' call for
  reflexivity about knowledge production aligns with the project's meta-philosophical
  inquiry into literature review methodology. Their critique suggests that ethical
  literature reviews must attend to power dynamics and not just epistemic
  comprehensiveness.

  POSITION: Critical/structural analysis of knowledge production ethics; emphasizes
  institutional power, editorial practices, and need for reflexivity about who
  produces knowledge.

  abstract = {To commemorate 40 years since the founding of the Journal of Business Ethics, the editors in chief of the journal have invited the editors to provide commentaries on the future of business ethics. This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme The Ethics and Politics of Academic Knowledge Production. Questions of who produces knowledge about what, and how that knowledge is produced, are inherent to editing and publishing academic journals. At the Journal of Business Ethics, we understand the ethical responsibility of academic knowledge production as going far beyond conventions around the integrity of the research content and research processes. We are deeply aware that access to resources, knowledge of the rules of the game, and being able to set those rules, are systematically and unequally distributed. One could ask the question “for whom is knowledge now ethical’”? (See the Burrell commentary.) We have a responsibility to address these inequalities and open up our journal to lesser heard voices, ideas, and ways of being. Our six commentators pursue this through various aspects of the ethics and politics of academic knowledge production. Working with MacIntyre’s scheme of practices and institutions, Andrew West provides commentary on the internal good of business ethics learning and education. Inviting us to step out of the cave, Christopher Michaelson urges a clear-eyed, unblinking focus on the purposes and audiences of business ethics scholarship. As developmental editor, Scott Taylor uncovers some of the politics of peer review with the aim of nurturing of unconventional research. Mike Hyman presents his idiosyncratic view of marketing ethics. In the penultimate commentary, Julie Nelson attributes difficulties in the academic positioning of the Business Ethics field to the hegemony of a masculine-centric model of the firm. And finally, Gibson Burrell provides a powerful provocation to go undercover as researcher-investigators in a parallel ethics of the research process.},

  series = {Research Ethics Forum},
  pages = {19--57},
  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-99435-2_2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dougherty analyzes the concept of the scholarly record and how it
  should be corrected when research integrity violations occur. He argues that the
  humanities have fallen short compared to natural sciences in ensuring the
  integrity of the published record. The scholarly record includes not just
  publications but also the web of citations, attributions, and knowledge claims that
  constitute disciplinary knowledge. Dougherty develops frameworks for understanding
  what counts as part of the scholarly record and what methods (retraction,
  correction, commentary) are appropriate for maintaining its integrity.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on plagiarism and misconduct, Dougherty's analysis of the
  scholarly record has implications for literature review ethics. If the scholarly
  record includes not just individual publications but the network of citations and
  knowledge claims, then selective literature engagement potentially distorts this
  record by breaking connections or omitting relevant work. Dougherty's emphasis on
  correcting the record also raises questions about what obligations scholars have
  when they discover their own literature reviews were incomplete or biased.

  POSITION: Research integrity framework focused on maintaining the reliability of
  the scholarly record; emphasizes need for humanities disciplines to develop better
  integrity mechanisms.

  volume = {29},
  number = {2},
  doi = {10.31874/2309-1606-2023-29-2-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Khamitov develops a philosophical anthropology of academic integrity
  that goes beyond rule-following to examine it as a will or existential commitment.
  Drawing on meta-anthropology, he argues that academic integrity becomes
  unconditional only when driven by the will to knowledge, creativity, and
  co-creation, not merely the will to power or self-preservation. True academic
  integrity requires genuine academic dialogue and cannot exist as a simulacrum of
  rule-compliance. Khamitov examines how this understanding applies during war and
  peace, connecting academic integrity to broader questions of human existence and
  responsibility.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a deeper philosophical anthropology of what academic integrity
  means beyond procedural compliance. Khamitov's emphasis on academic integrity as
  requiring genuine dialogue and will to knowledge (not just power) offers a
  framework for evaluating whether literature review practices reflect authentic
  scholarly engagement or merely strategic positioning. His work suggests that
  responsible scholarship requires not just following norms but cultivating the right
  kind of will and orientation toward knowledge.

  POSITION: Philosophical anthropology/existential approach to academic integrity;
  emphasizes will, dialogue, and authenticity beyond rule-following.

  abstract = {Academic integrity in education and science is understood as an ability that translates from possible into actual justice in the relations of students, teachers and scientists, their respect for their own dignity and the dignity of colleagues, as well as a focus on sincere creativity and co-creation. Academic integrity is the ability to maintain and develop the reputation of a conscientious, tolerant and creative professional who does not envy the talent of colleagues and does not appropriate their achievements. In the article, academic integrity appears not only as a demand and a challenge, but also as a will. In the coordinates of the methodology of meta-anthropology, it is proven that at the level of the will to self-preservation and procreation, as well as at the level of the will to power, any virtue, including academic and conditional, moreover, its deformations and distortions are possible. Only under the influence of the will to knowledge and creativity of the finite being of a person, which is supplemented by the will to co-creation in the meta-boundary being, academic integrity acquires an unconditional character and naturalness. It has been proven that true academic integrity is impossible without true academic dialogue, without it it turns into a simulacrum. The heuristic meaning of the concept “will to academic integrity” is substantiated. The will to academic integrity is an important component of the will to scientific novelty and actualizes academic writing that has heuristic achievements, is free from plagiarism, does not amount to compilation and is not a fabrication. As an example of the action of such a will in the academic community, the Kyiv anthropological school is presented in its development in the directions of existential anthropology and metaanthropology. The role of academic integrity in conditions of war and peace is shown.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Building on Foucault, anarchist theory, and anti-racist feminist
  scholarship, Luchies argues that academic knowledge production in social movement
  research is embedded in exploitative and hierarchical power relations. He proposes
  three ethics to counter this: movement-relevant research (confronting extractive
  knowledge-making), anti-oppressive practice (resisting neutral and disinterested
  postures), and prefigurative methods (modeling non-hierarchical authority). These
  ethics together facilitate an "insurrection of knowledges" that challenges the
  regime of truth underlying academic research.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on social movement research, Luchies' critique of
  extractive and hierarchical knowledge production applies to literature review
  practices. His emphasis on movement-relevance raises questions about who benefits
  from scholarly literature reviews and whose interests they serve. The
  anti-oppressive and prefigurative ethics suggest that responsible scholarship
  requires interrogating power relations not just in fieldwork but in how scholars
  engage with and represent others' intellectual work. This challenges individualistic
  virtue approaches by foregrounding systemic power.

  emphasizes movement-relevance, anti-oppression, and prefigurative practice as
  alternative ethics.

  abstract = {Despite ongoing efforts to articulate radical methods and theoretical frameworks for social movement research, the field remains embedded in exploitative, oppressive, and hierarchical modes of knowledge production. Following Foucault, I argue that this is because societies like ours, founded through racial and patriarchal violence, are invested in a regime of truth supportive of that violence. In light of this, I argue that social movements scholars need to adopt a radically different form of knowledge practice. Building on anarchist, anti-racist feminist, and anti-colonial scholarship, this paper begins by analysing how liberalism constrains social justice organizing and how academic norms foreclose accountable social movements scholarship. I then introduce three unique ethics emerging in resistance to this situation: movement-relevant, anti-oppressive, and prefigurative. The first confronts the extractive imperatives of enlightenment truth-making; the second resists its neutral and disinterested tendencies; and the third models a rejection of its hierarchical and exclusive mode of authority. I argue that together they provide scholars with a strategy for re-/orienting their research towards what Foucault theorizes as an insurrection of knowledges. These three ethical frameworks combine to facilitate an insurrectionary power/knowledge that fosters collective struggle as it progressively dismantles the regime of truth underlying social movements research.},
