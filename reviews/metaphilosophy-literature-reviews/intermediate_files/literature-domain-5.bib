DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the philosophical foundations of interpretation and the principle of charity as they relate to scholarly practice, particularly in literature reviews and philosophical engagement with others' work. The field divides into three main streams: (1) Gadamerian hermeneutics emphasizing the horizon-fusion model of understanding texts within tradition, (2) Davidsonian radical interpretation using the principle of charity as a constraint on attributing beliefs and meanings, and (3) contemporary debates about the ethics and politics of charitable reading in academic philosophy. Recent work has problematized the seemingly neutral principle of charity, revealing how it can perpetuate disciplinary hierarchies and epistemic oppression when selectively applied. The domain connects hermeneutic theory (Gadamer, Ricoeur) with analytic philosophy of language (Davidson, Quine) and with feminist and critical approaches questioning who receives charitable interpretation.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational to the research project as it directly addresses methodological questions about how to read, represent, and engage with others' philosophical positions in literature reviews. The principle of charity frames the interpretive obligations scholars have when representing others' views, while hermeneutic theory illuminates the conditions for adequate understanding across historical and conceptual distance. The critical literature on the "charitability gap" raises crucial ethical questions about whose work receives generous interpretation and whose is subjected to uncharitable reading—questions directly relevant to the ethics of literature review methodology.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive literature on the principle of charity in formal semantics and interpretation theory, and growing work on its misuses in academic philosophy, there remains little explicit discussion of how these principles should guide the specific practice of writing literature reviews. The connection between hermeneutic philosophy and the methodological choices made in constructing literature reviews is largely implicit. Additionally, most discussions of charity focus on interpreting individual texts or utterances rather than synthesizing bodies of literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis phase should trace how the principle of charity moves from Davidson's semantic theory to contemporary debates about interpretive practice, and how Gadamerian hermeneutics offers an alternative model emphasizing historical consciousness and prejudices. Key tension: whether charity is a transcendental condition of interpretation (Davidson) or an ethical virtue that can be misapplied (Lockard, Stevens). Consider how these different models would change literature review methodology.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Davidsonian Charity (5 papers): Charity as constitutive constraint on interpretation
- Gadamerian Hermeneutics (3 papers): Horizon-fusion and prejudice in understanding
- Critical/Feminist Approaches (2 papers): Charitability gap and selective application
- Virtue Ethics of Interpretation (2 papers): Charity as moral and epistemic virtue

  CORE ARGUMENT: Davidson develops a truth-theoretic approach to meaning where interpretation proceeds via radical interpretation constrained by the principle of charity. The principle requires that we maximize agreement and attribute rationality to speakers, treating their beliefs as largely true and consistent, as a condition for making sense of their utterances. This framework treats meaning and belief as interdependent and resolved simultaneously through charitable interpretation.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the principle of charity as central to interpretation theory. Directly relevant to literature review methodology as it articulates the interpretive obligations when representing others' philosophical positions. Davidson's argument that massive error is ruled out by the conditions of interpretability provides philosophical grounding for charitable reading practices, though recent critics question whether this principle is applied uniformly across academic philosophy.

  POSITION: Represents the Davidsonian constitutive view that charity is not merely advisable but required for interpretation to succeed—it is a transcendental condition rather than an ethical recommendation.

  abstract = {Abstract This volume collects Davidson's seminal contributions to the philosophy of language. Its key insight is that the concept of truth can shed light on various issues connected to meaning: Davidson, who assumes a partial and primitive understanding of the truth predicate, reverses Tarski who had succeeded in elucidating the concept of truth by taking the notion of ‘translation’ (preservation of meaning) for granted. In the first of five subsections into which the papers are thematically organized, Davidson develops the systematic constraints a theory of meaning has to meet and shows how an approach to semantics based on the concept of truth meets these demands better than any rival approach. Sect. 2 explores whether one can give semantic analyses of quotation, intensional contexts, and force within the extensional limitations of the truth‐theoretic framework. Viewing the theories of meaning developed in the first section as empirical, Sect. 3 inquires into their testability: can we verify these theories without presupposing concepts too closely aligned to that of meaning, interpretation, and synonymy? Davidson develops constitutive constraints on applying truth theories to interpret the speech behaviour of others: we have to view utterances for the most part as assertions of the speaker's beliefs and those beliefs as largely true and consistent (he terms this the ‘Principle of Charity’). Sect. 4 combines these interpretative constraints with the semantic concept of truth developed in Sect. 1 to tackle metaphysical issues. Davidson claims that truth is not relative to conceptual schemes but only to languages that can be shown to be largely correct about the world; consequently, by studying those languages via the semantic concept of truth we can derive ontological conclusions. Sect. 5 explores aspects of linguistic usage that form a particular threat to theories of meaning (such as Davidson's) that focus on the literal meaning of sentences: for truth theory to be adequate as a general theory of language, it must give valid accounts of sentence mood, illocutionary force, and metaphorical meaning.},

  journal = {Hypatia},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {38},
  number = {1},
  pages = {22--44},
  doi = {10.1017/hyp.2023.1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lockard identifies a "charitability gap" in academic philosophy where charitable interpretation is selectively applied—demanded disproportionately from marginalized scholars while extended generously to canonical (often white, male) authors, even when they espouse racist or sexist views. This selective charity perpetuates epistemic oppression by creating conditions for testimonial smothering, functions as an "orientation device" enforcing disciplinary conformity, and requires resistant philosophers to remain in oppressive interpretive worlds.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for the ethics of literature review methodology. Exposes how supposedly neutral interpretive principles can be deployed in ways that shore up disciplinary hierarchies. Raises the question of whether literature reviews should apply uniform charity or whether some positions (e.g., those perpetuating oppression) merit less generous interpretation. Directly challenges the assumption that charity is an unproblematic methodological virtue.

  POSITION: Represents critical/feminist scholarship questioning the politics of interpretation. While not advocating abandonment of charity entirely, Lockard shows that its selective application is a mechanism of epistemic injustice in scholarly practice.

  abstract = {Abstract In this article, I explore some harms that emerge from the call for charity in academic philosophy. A charitability gap, I suggest, exists both between who we tend to read charitably and who we tend to expect charitability from. This gap shores up the disciplinary status quo and (re)produces epistemic oppression, which helps preserve philosophy's status as a discipline that is, to use Charles Mills's language, conceptually and demographically dominated by whiteness and maleness (Mills 1998, 2). I am particularly interested in calls for charity made in response to critiques of racist or sexist authors/texts. I suggest that in these cases, interpretive charity perpetuates epistemic violence by creating conditions for testimonial smothering (Dotson 2011); that it functions as an orientation device (Ahmed 2006) designed to bring “unruly” philosophers back in line with disciplinary practices and traditions; and that it requires resistant philosophers to remain in oppressive worlds (Lugones 2003a; Pohlhaus 2011). Although charitability is risky—and charity is disproportionately demanded from already marginalized philosophers—I am hesitant to abandon charity entirely. The outright rejection of charitable orientations toward texts or others commits philosophers to a purity politics that, following Alexis Shotwell, I suggest we resist (Shotwell 2016).},

@article{Vandevelde2021charity,

  title = {Charity in Interpretation: Principle or Virtue? A Return to Gregory the Great},
  journal = {American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2021},
  volume = {95},
  number = {3},
  pages = {505--526},
  doi = {10.5840/ACPQ202161226},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Vandevelde argues that charity in interpretation is both an epistemic and moral virtue, not merely a methodological principle as in Davidson. Drawing on Gregory the Great's 6th-century hermeneutics, Vandevelde shows that charity involves attraction to the good in a teleological process, making the interpreter not just a technician following rules but a moral agent acting in community. He criticizes Davidson's version for assuming beliefs can be ascribed without prior interpretation when interpreters and subjects don't share cultural/historical backgrounds.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges analytic philosophy of language and virtue epistemology with religious hermeneutics, offering a richer account of charity than purely procedural models. Relevant to literature reviews as it suggests that representing others' views is not just a technical matter of correct interpretation but involves moral qualities of the interpreter. Raises questions about what virtues (beyond charity) should guide scholarly engagement with texts.

  POSITION: Virtue-theoretic position locating charity within a broader account of epistemic and moral character. Contrasts with Davidson's constitutive view and positions charity as something cultivated rather than presupposed.

  abstract = {I defend the view that charity in interpretation is both an epistemic and a moral virtue. In the first part, I examine Donald Davidson’s version of his principle of charity and question his ascription of beliefs by raising a phenomenological objection: beliefs themselves, before being ascribed, need to be interpreted when interpreters and the subjects they try to understand do not share the same cultural and historical background. In the second section, I examine the notion of epistemic virtue as discussed in virtue epistemology and question whether an epistemic virtue can be completely separated from a moral virtue. In the third section, I show how Gregory the Great, Father of the Church and Pope in the 6th century, understands the virtue of charity in interpretation not as a motivation (in a causal process of interpretation, as in virtue epistemology) but as an attraction to the good (in a teleological process) so that the interpreter is not only a technician producing an interpretation (following a “principle” of charity, as in Davidson) but a moral agent acting in a community.},

  volume = {23},

  pages = {295--307},
  doi = {10.1007/s10677-019-10054-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: De Caro and Vaccarezza develop a "principle of phronetic charity" that integrates Aristotelian practical wisdom (phronesis) with the principle of charity. They argue that interpretation requires not just maximizing agreement but exercising good judgment about when and how to apply charity, taking into account the specific context, the interpreter's relationship to the text, and the ethical stakes of the interpretation. This phronetic approach makes charity context-sensitive rather than an invariant rule.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a middle path between treating charity as an absolute requirement (Davidson) and critiquing its misapplication (Lockard). Directly relevant to literature review methodology as it suggests that representing others' views requires interpretive judgment shaped by practical wisdom—not mechanical application of rules. The emphasis on context-sensitivity addresses how literature reviews must adapt charitable reading to different disciplinary contexts and rhetorical situations.

  POSITION: Neo-Aristotelian position viewing charity as requiring phronesis. Modifies Davidsonian charity with virtue-theoretic considerations while maintaining that interpretation involves ethical dimensions.

  abstract = {The recent discussions on the unity of virtue (or lack thereof) suffer from a lack of reference to the processes through which we interpret each other as moral agents. In the present paper it is argued that much light can be thrown on that crucial issue by appealing to a version of Donald Davidson’s Principle of Charity, which we call “Principle of Phronetic Charity”. The idea is that in order to treat somebody as a moral agent, one has first to attribute to them, at least pro tempore, a significant degree of practical wisdom (intended as ethical expertise) and, then, to assess and rationally adjust such attribution of competence via actual engagement with them – a process that may lead to different responses on the part of the interpreter (i.e., the confirmation, upgrading, or withdrawing of the preliminary interpretation). After expounding and defending the Principle of Phronetic Charity and the interpretive practices connected with it, we discuss the repercussions of our account on the issue of the epistemic access to virtue. We will show, in particular, that some important components of both disunitarianism and unitarianism have to be retained: in accordance with the former, we stress the role of concrete experience over pure speculation and, up to a point, the idea that virtues tend to form variegated ensembles; in accordance with the latter, we accept the claim that virtues are not attributed to moral agents in isolation. Ultimately, however, the account developed here rejects both the atomism of the disunitarian view and the holism of the “Unity of the Virtues”, since it is in fact a form of molecularism, according to which virtues come neither individually nor as a whole, but rather as clusters},

  doi = {10.1002/9781118328408.ch13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pagin provides a systematic overview of Davidson's principle of charity as employed in radical interpretation, explaining how charity functions as both a methodological constraint (for the radical interpreter constructing a semantic theory) and a metaphysical principle (determining meaning and belief). He clarifies the relationship between holistic interpretation, the interdependence of meaning and belief, and the role of charity in breaking into the hermeneutic circle. Pagin also addresses criticisms of charity and defends its necessity for Davidson's semantic program.

  RELEVANCE: Essential handbook article for understanding the technical details of Davidsonian charity and its role in interpretation theory. Provides the analytic philosophy background needed to evaluate how charity principles might transfer to literature review methodology. Clarifies the distinction between charity as a truth-maximizing constraint and charity as rationality-maximizing constraint, relevant to debates about whether literature reviews should prioritize reconstructing what authors "really meant" or what makes their positions most defensible.

  POSITION: Explicates and defends the Davidsonian constitutive view. Treats charity as a non-optional feature of interpretation grounded in the nature of mental content and linguistic meaning.

  volume = {32},
  number = {4},
  pages = {403--439},
  doi = {10.22329/il.v32i4.3620},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lewiński identifies a fundamental paradox in applying the principle of charity to argumentation: being charitable to one party in a dispute often requires being uncharitable to the other party. Since argumentation involves at least two parties who disagree, an analyst who interprets one party's position in the strongest possible way may be forced to interpret the other party's position as weaker. Lewiński argues this paradox requires significantly limiting the application of charity depending on contextual factors and the analyst's dialectical role.

  RELEVANCE: Crucial for literature review methodology where one is synthesizing positions that are often in disagreement with each other. Raises the question of whether representing competing positions in a literature review requires taking sides or whether a neutral stance is possible. The paradox highlights that "charitable" representation is not simply a matter of being fair to individual authors but involves complex decisions about how to construct the overall dialectical space.

  POSITION: Critical position showing internal tension in charity principles when applied to multi-party argumentation. Relevant to debates about neutrality and positioning in literature reviews.

  abstract = {The principle of charity is used in philosophy of language and argumentation theory as an important principle of interpretation which credits speakers with “the best” plausible interpretation of their discourse. I contend that the argumentation account, while broadly advocated, misses the basic point of a dialectical conception which approaches argumentation as discussion between (at least) two parties who disagree over the issue discussed. Therefore, paradoxically, an analyst who is charitable to one discussion party easily becomes uncharitable to the other. To overcome this paradox, I suggest to significantly limit the application of the principle of charity depending on contextual factors.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10503-023-09615-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pruś and Sikora propose a modified "dialectical principle of charity" that addresses problems in Davidson's version by incorporating procedures from Ignatius Loyola's presupponendum and pragma-dialectics. Their principle offers concrete steps for arguers to ensure mutual understanding and avoid cognitive biases, emphasizing that charity requires active work by both parties in a discussion, not just the interpreter. This procedural approach makes charity actionable in argumentation contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Offers practical procedures for implementing charitable interpretation in scholarly contexts. Relevant to literature review methodology as it provides concrete steps for ensuring one has accurately understood positions before critiquing them. The emphasis on procedural safeguards against cognitive bias is particularly relevant given concerns about selective application of charity. However, literature reviews differ from live debates in that authors cannot correct misunderstandings.

  POSITION: Pragmatic/procedural approach to charity, modifying Davidson with pragma-dialectical insights. Focuses on making charity operational in actual argumentative practice.

  abstract = {This paper aims to discuss a well-known concept from argumentation theory, namely the principle of charity. It will show that this principle, especially in its contemporary version as formulated by Donald Davidson, meets with some serious problems. Since we need the principle of charity in any kind of critical discussion, we propose the way of modifying it according to the presupponendum—the rule written in the sixteenth century by Ignatius Loyola. While also corresponding with pragma-dialectical rules, it also provides additional content. This will be termed the dialectical principle of charity, and it offers a few steps to be performed during an argument in order to make sure that the participants understand each other well and are not deceived by any cognitive bias. The meaning of these results could be of great significance for argumentation theory, pragma-dialectics and the practice of public discourse as it enhances the principle of charity and makes it easier to apply in argumentation.},

  author = {Stevens, Katharina},
  title = {Principle of Charity as a Moral Requirement in Non-Institutionalized Argumentation},
  journal = {Argumentation},
  year = {2020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Stevens argues that there is a pro tanto moral duty to be charitable in argument, but the amount of charitable effort required varies depending on the type of dialogue. In non-institutionalized contexts, arguers have influence over the dialogue type adopted. Stevens distinguishes egocentric charity (interpreting arguments as strong from the interpreter's viewpoint), emic charity (interpreting as strong from the arguer's viewpoint), and complex charity (uniting both), arguing only complex charity avoids "toxic charity."

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the ethical dimensions of charitable interpretation relevant to literature review methodology. The distinction between types of charity illuminates different ways scholars might represent others' work—reconstructing positions to be strongest by current lights versus trying to capture how authors themselves understood their positions. The concept of "toxic charity" is particularly relevant to concerns about condescending or distorting representations.

  POSITION: Moral/normative position treating charity as an ethical obligation that must be carefully calibrated to context. Bridges analytic argumentation theory with ethical concerns about representation.

  number = {3},
  pages = {337--359},
  doi = {10.1080/09672550600858320},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Glüer investigates the modal status of the principle of charity, asking whether it is a priori or a posteriori, and what kind of necessity it has. She argues that while Davidson treats charity as a priori and conceptually necessary (constitutive of belief and meaning), there is reason to think of it as an empirical truth. Even if charity is essential to belief and meaning, it might be an a posteriori necessity rather than a conceptual truth, and our ordinary modal intuitions might support only psychological-nomological necessity, not metaphysical necessity.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses fundamental questions about the philosophical status of interpretive principles. If charity is merely psychologically necessary (how we happen to interpret) rather than metaphysically necessary (how we must interpret), this has implications for its normative force in literature review methodology. Suggests that prescriptions about charitable reading need grounding in something other than conceptual necessity.

  POSITION: Defends empiricist/naturalist view of charity against Davidson's a priori conceptual view. Questions whether interpretive principles have the transcendental status often claimed for them.
  },
  keywords = {principle-of-charity, epistemology, modality, Medium},
  abstract = {According to Donald Davidson, linguistic meaning is determined by the principle of charity. Because of Davidson's semantic behaviourism, charity's significance is both epistemic and metaphysical: charity not only provides the radical interpreter with a method for constructing a semantic theory on the basis of his data, but it does so because it is the principle metaphysically determining meaning. In this paper, I assume that charity does determine meaning. On this assumption, I investigate both its epistemic and metaphysical status: is charity a priori or a posteriori? And what kind of necessity does it have? According to Davidson himself, charity is an a priori truth and its necessity is conceptual: it is essential to, or constitutive of, our common concepts of meaning and belief. Not only does this generate tension within Davidson's own, Quine-inspired epistemology, but there is independent reason to think of charity as an empirical truth. Even so, charity might be essential to belief and meaning in the sense of being an a posteriori necessity. I conclude that our ordinary modal intuitions might well support charity's psychological-nomological necessity, but that they do not reach all the way to metaphysical necessity.},

  number = {4},
  pages = {487},
  doi = {10.2307/430490},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer's hermeneutics emphasizes that understanding involves the fusion of the interpreter's horizon with the text's horizon, mediated by tradition and historical consciousness. Prejudices (Vorurteile) are not obstacles to understanding but enabling conditions. The hermeneutic circle—understanding parts through the whole and the whole through parts—characterizes all interpretation. Against method-centered approaches, Gadamer argues understanding is a mode of being-in-the-world rather than applying interpretive rules.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to Davidsonian charity for thinking about interpretation in literature reviews. Gadamer's emphasis on historical consciousness and the role of tradition suggests literature reviews must attend to how texts are situated in evolving traditions, not just interpret them by current standards. The fusion of horizons model implies that understanding others' work changes the interpreter, relevant to how engagement with literature should transform one's own thinking.

  POSITION: Continental hermeneutic tradition emphasizing historicity and tradition. Contrasts with analytic approaches treating interpretation as hypothesis-testing constrained by charity principles.

  pages = {1812--1826},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dresner explores the implications of Davidson's principle of charity for intercultural communication, where differences in cultural background potentially challenge the assumption of shared beliefs and rationality. He argues that even in cases of significant cultural difference, charity remains necessary for recognizing others as language users and believers, though the specific content of charitable attributions may differ. The principle's requirement to maximize agreement is compatible with recognizing deep disagreements about specific topics.

  RELEVANCE: Extends charity to contexts where interpreters and subjects have different cultural frameworks, relevant to literature reviews engaging with texts from different intellectual traditions or historical periods. Addresses the tension between recognizing genuine differences and the need for shared background assumptions. Relevant to debates about whether literature reviews must prioritize the authors' own cultural contexts or can interpret through contemporary frameworks.

  POSITION: Defends applicability of Davidsonian charity across cultural divides while acknowledging that cultural context affects how charity is applied. Mediates between universalist and relativist approaches to interpretation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Boongaling argues that Strawson's critique of Russell's theory of definite descriptions fails because Strawson did not apply the principle of charity in interpreting Russell's theory. The principle requires adopting the most plausible interpretation and ascribing consistency and rationality. Strawson should have considered Russell's epistemological project as the proper context for evaluating his theory of descriptions. This case study illustrates how failure to apply charity leads to misguided philosophical criticism.

  RELEVANCE: Provides concrete case study of how charity principles apply to philosophical critique, directly relevant to literature review methodology where one is evaluating and representing others' philosophical positions. Shows that charity requires understanding a theory in its proper context (Russell's epistemological concerns) rather than judging it by inappropriate standards. Illustrates dangers of uncharitable reading leading to ineffective criticism.

To further this end, the paper delves into the arguments presented by Strawson against Russell’s theory of definite descriptions. In general, Strawson’s arguments are not enough to demolish Russell’s theory of definite descriptions and the main reason for this is the former’s failure to adopt the more/most charitable interpretation of the latter’s theory. This paper also argues that the crucial element which Strawson should have considered in evaluating Russell’s theory so as to comply with the demands of the principle of charity is the latter’s epistemological concern (or project), since this is its proper context.
