# Literature Review Plan: The Methodology and Ethics of Literature Reviews in Philosophy

## Research Idea Summary

This project is a metaphilosophical inquiry into literature reviews as a scholarly practice within philosophy and the humanities. It asks what makes a literature review good, what purposes literature reviews serve within the philosophical enterprise, and whether literature reviews can be ethically deficient -- through biased selection, misrepresentation, citational injustice, or systematic omission. The scope is restricted to philosophy and the humanities, treating the literature review as an object of philosophical reflection rather than a mere methodological tool.

## Key Research Questions

1. What makes a good literature review? What are the criteria for quality, rigor, and comprehensiveness in a philosophical literature review?
2. What is the purpose of a literature review? How does it serve knowledge production, scholarly communication, and the philosophical enterprise?
3. Are there unethical literature reviews? What ethical issues arise in how scholars select, represent, cite, or omit literature?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Metaphilosophy and the Methodology of Philosophy

**Focus**: The nature of philosophical inquiry itself, including how philosophers understand their own methods, the role of the philosophical literature in philosophical practice, and debates about what constitutes legitimate philosophical methodology. This domain provides the overarching framework: if philosophy has distinctive methods, then literature reviews in philosophy must be understood in light of those methods.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the methodology of philosophy? How do philosophers understand their own practice?
- What role does engagement with existing literature play in philosophical argumentation?
- How do different metaphilosophical positions (analytic, continental, pragmatist, experimental) conceive of the relationship between a philosopher and the existing corpus?
- Is philosophy cumulative? Does it make progress? What implications does this have for how literature is surveyed?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "metaphilosophy", "philosophical methodology", "philosophical progress"; PhilPapers categories on metaphilosophy
- Key terms: ["metaphilosophy", "philosophical methodology", "philosophy of philosophy", "philosophical progress", "nature of philosophy", "methods of philosophy"]
- Expected papers: 8-12 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that explicitly theorize philosophical methodology and the role of the literature; major metaphilosophical positions (Williamson, Cappelen, Chalmers, Overgaard, Haslanger)

**Relevance to Project**: Establishes the meta-level framework. A literature review in philosophy must be understood against the backdrop of what philosophy is and how it works. Different metaphilosophical commitments yield different standards for literature engagement.

### Domain 2: Purpose, Epistemology, and Methodology of Literature Reviews in the Humanities

**Focus**: Explicit theorizing about what literature reviews are, what they are for, and how they should be conducted -- specifically in philosophy and the humanities (not in the natural or social sciences). This includes: the genre of the literature review, the state-of-the-art survey, the handbook chapter, and the review article as forms of scholarly production. Also covers the epistemology of literature reviews: how surveying existing work generates new knowledge, identifies gaps, and structures a field.

**Key Questions**:
- What is a literature review in philosophy? How does it differ from a literature review in the sciences?
- What epistemic functions do literature reviews serve? (Synthesis, gap identification, argument mapping, agenda setting)
- What methodologies exist for conducting literature reviews in the humanities?
- Are there explicit quality criteria for philosophical literature reviews?
- How do systematic review methodologies (from evidence-based practice) translate -- or fail to translate -- to philosophy?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: PhilPapers searches on "literature review methodology"; library science and information science literature on humanities research methods; methodology handbooks for philosophy
- Key terms: ["literature review methodology philosophy", "literature review humanities", "scholarly review article", "philosophical survey", "state of the art philosophy", "systematic review humanities", "scoping review humanities", "research methodology humanities"]
- Expected papers: 8-12 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that explicitly discuss the literature review as a genre or method in philosophy/humanities contexts; methodological guides; reflections by philosophers on their review practices

**Relevance to Project**: This is the most directly on-topic domain. It provides whatever explicit theorizing exists about the practice under investigation. The user suspects this literature may be thin, which itself would be a finding.

---

### Domain 3: Citation Ethics, Epistemic Injustice, and Scholarly Inclusion

**Focus**: The ethics of citation practices, with emphasis on how citational patterns can perpetuate or resist epistemic injustice. This domain covers: citational justice and injustice, testimonial and hermeneutical injustice as they manifest in scholarly citation, the ethics of who gets cited and who gets omitted, feminist and critical race critiques of citation practices, and the normative dimensions of bibliographic selection.

**Key Questions**:
- What ethical obligations do scholars have in their citation practices?
- How do citation patterns reflect and reinforce epistemic injustice (testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice)?
- What is "citational justice" and what does it demand?
- How do biases (gender, race, geography, institutional prestige) shape citation networks in philosophy?
- Can a literature review be unjust? What would make it so?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "epistemic injustice", "feminist epistemology"; PhilPapers searches; Fricker's foundational work and its reception
- Key terms: ["citation ethics", "citational justice", "epistemic injustice citation", "citation bias philosophy", "who gets cited", "testimonial injustice scholarship", "citation politics", "citational practice feminist"]
- Expected papers: 10-15 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that directly address the ethics of citation (Fricker, Ahmed, Dotson, Alcoff, Medina); empirical studies of citation bias in philosophy specifically; normative arguments about citational obligations

**Relevance to Project**: Directly addresses Research Question 3. If literature reviews involve selecting which works to include and exclude, they are sites where epistemic justice or injustice is enacted. This is likely the richest domain for the ethics component.

---

### Domain 4: Canon Formation, Exclusion, and the Politics of Philosophical Knowledge

**Focus**: How the philosophical canon is formed, maintained, challenged, and revised. This domain covers: the politics of canon formation in philosophy, debates about the "Western" philosophical canon, the exclusion of non-Western philosophical traditions, feminist critiques of the canon, the relationship between canonicity and what counts as "the literature" to be reviewed, and the role of anthologies, textbooks, and survey articles in canon maintenance.

**Key Questions**:
- How is the philosophical canon formed? What mechanisms sustain it?
- How do canons shape what counts as "the relevant literature" for any given inquiry?
- What are the major critiques of canon formation in philosophy (feminist, decolonial, comparative, pluralist)?
- How do literature reviews participate in canon formation and maintenance?
- What is the relationship between anthologizing, surveying, and canonizing?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "feminist philosophy", comparative philosophy discussions; PhilPapers categories on canon and inclusion; works on the demographics and sociology of professional philosophy
- Key terms: ["philosophical canon formation", "canon exclusion philosophy", "Western philosophy canon critique", "decolonizing philosophy", "philosophy canon gender", "anthologizing philosophy", "philosophical tradition exclusion", "pluralism in philosophy"]
- Expected papers: 8-12 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that theorize canon formation mechanisms (not just advocate for including specific figures); empirical work on what gets taught and cited; philosophical arguments about canonicity and its epistemological effects

**Relevance to Project**: A literature review necessarily operates within a canon or challenges it. Understanding how canons are formed and contested illuminates the structural conditions under which any literature review is written. This connects the methodological and ethical questions.

---

### Domain 5: Hermeneutics, Interpretation, and Charitable Reading

**Focus**: The philosophical tradition of hermeneutics and theories of textual interpretation, insofar as they bear on how one reads, represents, and engages with others' philosophical work in a literature review. Also covers the principle of charity, strong vs. weak readings, and the ethics of interpretation in scholarly contexts.

**Key Questions**:
- What does hermeneutic theory say about the conditions for adequate interpretation of philosophical texts?
- What role does the principle of charity play in representing others' views?
- What are the ethics of representation in scholarly writing -- how should one summarize, paraphrase, or critique another's position?
- How do different hermeneutic traditions (Gadamerian, critical, feminist) conceptualize the reader-text relationship?
- What counts as a fair or accurate representation of a position in a literature review?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "hermeneutics", "charity principle"; PhilPapers categories on interpretation and charity; Gadamer, Ricoeur, and analytic discussions of the principle of charity
- Key terms: ["hermeneutics scholarly interpretation", "principle of charity philosophy", "ethics of interpretation", "charitable reading philosophy", "textual interpretation ethics", "representing philosophical positions", "philosophical hermeneutics"]
- Expected papers: 6-10 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that connect hermeneutic theory to scholarly practice (not purely abstract hermeneutics); discussions of the principle of charity as applied to reading others' work; reflections on misrepresentation in scholarly contexts

**Relevance to Project**: A literature review does not merely list works but interprets and represents them. Hermeneutic theory provides the philosophical resources for understanding what it means to read and represent another philosopher's work well or poorly.

### Domain 6: Sociology of Philosophy, Academic Gatekeeping, and Bibliometrics

**Focus**: Empirical and critical work on how the profession of philosophy operates, including: who gets published, cited, and read; institutional and structural factors shaping philosophical knowledge production; bibliometric studies of philosophy; peer review and editorial gatekeeping; the demographics of the discipline and their epistemic consequences.

**Key Questions**:
- What do bibliometric studies reveal about citation patterns in philosophy?
- How do institutional structures (journals, presses, departments, conferences) shape what counts as important philosophical literature?
- What role do peer review and editorial practices play in determining the literature available to be reviewed?
- How do the demographics of professional philosophy (gender, race, geography, tradition) shape the landscape of available literature?
- What is the relationship between prestige hierarchies and citational visibility?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: PhilPapers searches on sociology of philosophy; bibliometric studies of philosophy; publications from the APA Committee on the Status of Women, the British Philosophical Association reports, and similar
- Key terms: ["sociology of philosophy", "bibliometrics philosophy", "citation analysis philosophy", "academic gatekeeping philosophy", "peer review philosophy", "demographics philosophy profession", "philosophy journal rankings", "prestige bias philosophy"]
- Expected papers: 8-12 key papers
- Quality criteria: Empirical studies with data on philosophy specifically (not just academia generally); critical analyses of institutional structures; works connecting sociological observations to epistemological or ethical implications

**Relevance to Project**: Provides the empirical backdrop for the ethical questions. If a literature review can only survey what is available and visible, then the structural conditions of philosophical knowledge production constrain and shape what any literature review can accomplish.

### Domain 7: Research Ethics, Scholarly Integrity, and the Ethics of Knowledge Production

**Focus**: Broader questions about research ethics and scholarly integrity as they apply to the humanities, including: the ethics of knowledge production, responsibilities of scholars, intellectual honesty, plagiarism and misattribution, the ethics of selective engagement, and the norms governing scholarly discourse. Also covers philosophy of education insofar as it theorizes scholarly training and the transmission of intellectual practices.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the ethical norms governing scholarly communication in philosophy?
- What obligations do scholars have regarding comprehensive engagement with relevant literature?
- How does selective citation differ from legitimate scholarly judgment about relevance?
- What are the ethics of omission in scholarly work?
- How do norms of intellectual honesty and integrity apply specifically to the survey and review of literature?
- What role does training and pedagogy play in shaping citation and review practices?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "scientific research ethics" (for methodological parallels), "academic freedom"; PhilPapers categories on research ethics; works on scholarly integrity in the humanities
- Key terms: ["research ethics humanities", "scholarly integrity philosophy", "ethics of knowledge production", "intellectual honesty scholarship", "ethics of omission scholarship", "academic ethics philosophy", "responsible scholarship", "ethics scholarly communication"]
- Expected papers: 6-10 key papers
- Quality criteria: Works that address the humanities specifically (not just biomedical research ethics); philosophical arguments about scholarly obligations; discussions that connect research ethics to the specific practice of literature engagement

**Relevance to Project**: Provides the normative ethical framework for Research Question 3. While Domain 3 focuses on justice-based concerns (epistemic injustice), this domain covers broader ethical obligations: honesty, thoroughness, fairness, and responsibility in engaging with existing scholarship.

---

## Coverage Rationale

These seven domains provide comprehensive coverage by approaching the research questions from distinct but complementary angles:

- **Domains 1-2** address the foundational and methodological questions (What is a literature review in philosophy? What makes it good?).
- **Domains 3-4** address the justice and power dimensions (Who is included/excluded? How do structural factors shape the literature?).
- **Domain 5** addresses the interpretive dimension (How should one read and represent others' work?).
- **Domain 6** provides empirical grounding (What do the data show about citation and publication patterns in philosophy?).
- **Domain 7** provides the broader ethical framework (What are the norms of scholarly integrity?).

Together, they cover methodology, epistemology, ethics, hermeneutics, and sociology -- the key perspectives needed for a metaphilosophical inquiry into literature reviews. The domains have clear boundaries: Domain 3 is about justice in citation, Domain 4 is about canon formation, Domain 6 is about empirical patterns, and Domain 7 is about normative research ethics. While there are connections between them, each has a distinct primary literature.

## Expected Gaps

The research is likely to find:

1. **Very little direct theorizing** about the literature review as a philosophical genre or method -- most methodology literature comes from the sciences and social sciences, and philosophy has been largely unreflective about this practice.
2. **A disconnect** between the rich literature on epistemic injustice/citation ethics and its application to the specific practice of literature reviews.
3. **Limited empirical work** on citation patterns in philosophy compared to the natural and social sciences.
4. **No integrated framework** that brings together the methodological, hermeneutic, and ethical dimensions of literature reviews in philosophy.
5. **Under-theorized relationship** between canon formation and the practice of literature reviewing -- these are discussed separately but rarely connected.

These gaps would constitute the core contribution space for the research.

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 7
- **Estimated papers**: 55-85 total
- **Key positions**: Metaphilosophy (Williamson, Cappelen, Haslanger); Epistemic injustice (Fricker, Dotson, Medina); Canon critique (feminist, decolonial, pluralist); Hermeneutics (Gadamer, charity principle); Sociology of philosophy (bibliometrics, demographics); Research ethics (scholarly integrity, norms of engagement)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Fricker on epistemic injustice, Gadamer on hermeneutics, Williamson/Cappelen on philosophical methodology, classic statements on canon formation
2. **Directly on-topic work**: Any papers that explicitly theorize the literature review as a practice in philosophy or the humanities -- these are the rarest and most valuable finds
3. **Recent developments (2019-2025)**: Citational justice movement, decolonizing philosophy debates, recent metaphilosophy, AI and literature reviews
4. **Critical and contrarian perspectives**: Arguments against citational justice mandates, defenses of traditional canon, skepticism about philosophical progress, critiques of bibliometric approaches to philosophy
5. **Empirical studies**: Bibliometric analyses of philosophy, demographic studies of the profession, data on citation patterns

## Notes for Researchers

- **Cast a wide net**: The user expects that literature directly on this topic may be sparse. Researchers should search broadly and include works that are indirectly relevant (e.g., a paper on epistemic injustice that uses citation practices as an example, even if it does not theorize literature reviews per se).
- **Philosophy and humanities ONLY**: Exclude natural science methodology, medical systematic review literature, social science research methods -- UNLESS a work from those fields has been explicitly taken up and discussed within philosophy.
- **Use all available search tools**: This topic spans multiple sub-disciplines, so use `search_sep.py` and `fetch_sep.py` for foundational context, `search_philpapers.py` for philosophy-specific papers, `s2_search.py` and `search_openalex.py` for broader academic searches, and `search_core.py` for hard-to-find papers.
- **SEP is especially important here**: Fetch full SEP entries for "metaphilosophy", "epistemic injustice", "hermeneutics", "feminist epistemology", and related entries. The bibliographies of these entries will be rich sources of leads.
- **Check for recent work with `--recent` flag**: The citational justice literature and decolonizing philosophy debates are fast-moving; use `--recent` on PhilPapers and `--year 2020-2025` on Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex.
- **Use citation traversal**: When a key paper is found (e.g., Fricker 2007, Dotson 2012), use `s2_citations.py` to find both its references and papers that cite it. This is especially valuable for mapping a debate.
- **Include book chapters and monographs**: Much of the relevant philosophy literature is in books (e.g., Fricker's *Epistemic Injustice*, Gadamer's *Truth and Method*, Williamson's *The Philosophy of Philosophy*). These may not appear in all search tools but should be included via manual BibTeX entries when known to be central.
- **Be critical**: Include works that push back against the premises of the research questions (e.g., arguments that citation patterns are not ethically significant, defenses of existing canons, skepticism about metaphilosophy as a productive enterprise).
