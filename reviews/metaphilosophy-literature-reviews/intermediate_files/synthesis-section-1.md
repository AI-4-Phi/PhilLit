## Introduction

Philosophy is a discipline defined by relentless self-examination. It scrutinizes its own concepts, methods, and assumptions with a thoroughness unmatched in other fields of inquiry. The contemporary metaphilosophical literature -- from Williamson's (2007) naturalistic defense of philosophy as continuous with science, to Cappelen, Gendler, and Hawthorne's (2016) survey of its irreducibly plural methods, to D'Oro and Overgaard's (2017) argument that methodological choices reflect deeper metaphilosophical commitments -- attests to a vibrant culture of methodological reflection. Yet there is one scholarly practice that philosophy has largely failed to examine: the literature review itself. Every philosophical article positions itself within a tradition, surveys prior work, and selects which voices to include or exclude. These citational and synthetic acts are deeply consequential -- they reproduce canons, distribute epistemic recognition, and shape what counts as the state of the art. But philosophers have produced almost no explicit theorizing about what makes a literature review good, what purposes it serves, or how it can go ethically wrong.

This review synthesizes insights from seven domains -- metaphilosophy, review methodology, epistemic injustice, canon formation, hermeneutics, the sociology of philosophy, and research ethics -- to construct an argument about the methodology and ethics of literature reviews in philosophy and the humanities. The scarcity of direct literature on this topic is itself a central finding. A dedicated search for work on the purpose, epistemology, and methodology of literature reviews in philosophy yielded only six papers, most from adjacent fields such as health information science (Grant and Booth 2009). Philosophy's failure to theorize the literature review constitutes a significant blind spot -- one that is all the more striking given the discipline's otherwise relentless self-scrutiny, recently reinforced by Denecke's (2024) call for deep metaphilosophical reflection on what counts as philosophy across world history.

The stakes of this blind spot extend beyond methodology. If literature reviews enact epistemic justice or injustice through their citational choices -- as Fricker's (2007) foundational framework on testimonial and hermeneutical injustice suggests they can -- then the absence of explicit normative reflection on review practices leaves a consequential scholarly genre unexamined in precisely those dimensions where it matters most.

The review is organized around three questions: What makes a good philosophical literature review? What purposes do literature reviews serve? Can literature reviews be ethically deficient? Section 1 examines the methodological landscape, arguing that competing metaphilosophical commitments yield fundamentally different conceptions of what a review should accomplish, and that the hermeneutic dimension of interpreting and representing others' work adds a layer of complexity absent from empirical review methodologies. Section 2 turns to the ethics of selection, arguing that literature reviews are sites where epistemic injustice is enacted through citational choices, canonical reproduction, and structural gatekeeping. The review concludes by identifying specific research gaps that the project addresses -- gaps that emerge not from a single domain but from the failure to integrate resources that already exist across multiple philosophical subdisciplines.
