      "abstract": "Ferdinand de Saussure\u2019s Course in General Linguistics is one of the most influential texts of the 20th-century \u2013 an astonishing feat for what is, at heart, a series of deeply technical lectures about the structure of human languages. What the Course\u2019s vast influence shows, fundamentally, is the power of good interpretative skills. The interpretative tasks of laying down and clarifying definitions are often vital to providing the logical framework for all kinds of critical thinking \u2013 whether it be solving problems in business, or esoteric academic research. At the time sat which Saussure gave his lectures, linguistics was a scattered and inconsistent field, without a unified method or rigorous approach. He aimed to change that by setting down and clarifying definitions and distinctions that would provide a coherent methodological framework for the study of language. The terms laid down in the Course did exactly that \u2013 and they still make up the core of linguistic terminology a full century later. More than this, however, Saussure also highlighted the centrality of linguistic interpretation to understanding how we relate to the world, founding \u201csemiotics\u201d, or the study of signs \u2013 a field whose influence on academics across the humanities and social sciences is unparalleled.",

The rationale of this research is that the BRICS countries have come to assume a growing gravitas in the world, not only on strength of geography, demography and economy; but also because of the diversity contained in each of these BRICS countries. These diversities offer opportunities to learn a lot from each other, in addition the rest of the gamut of countries in the Global South as well as the nations of the Global North can benefit much from learning from the experience of the BRICS countries. The research commences with a survey of the most compelling societal trends shaping the 21st Century world, which will form the parameters of the context in which scholarship in the social sciences and humanities are destined to be conducted. The state of scholarship in the humanities and the social sciences and the imperatives of context will be the next topic under discussion. Within this landscape, the potential role of research on BRICS soil is then turned to. The BRICS countries are surveyed, then a conclusion is ventured as to their potential as a fountainhead for social sciences and humanities research.",

      "abstract": "This study discusses whether a biography can function as a source and a methodology in the research of humanities. Taking biography as a source, researchers of humanities can use a collection of biographical facts as research material or make it as a resource of writing. While taking it as a methodology, they manage to apply biographical methodology as a science in their research. This is not a simple issue because the 1980s biographical thinking cannot adapt themselves with the latest development in the science of humanities after the emergence of post-structuralist approaches. The approach of scientific biography of 1990s cannot adapt itself either, and seems to be awkward, and difficult to be followed up. Therefore, the authority of history as a science in universities in Indonesia needs to hold a congress to seek a contemporary biographical thinking which can keep up with the influence of post-modern approach [beyond modernism] and post-structuralist theories [beyond structuralism] in the researches of humanities. This study attempts to give some preliminary thoughts by revealing the weaknesses of the previous biographical methodology and also attempts to complete it by offering some alternative thoughts through borrowing or absorbing relevant post- structuralist theories.",

      "abstract": "Formal, methodological and content-related compliance with the international databases' standards are required for Russian peer-reviewed journals to be indexed with Scopus and Web of Science. Judging by the experience of the recent years, Russian peer-reviewed journals as well as Russian scientists find difficulties in integrating studies into the international databases. Russia's journals focused on social sciences and humanities are facing most barriers due to a number of historic reasons: a gap in the country's individual segment in the world science covering the period of Marxism underpinnings in social sciences and humanities; falling behind the world achievements in sciences directed by the Soviet prevailing ideology; the lack of ethically supported and academically shared competitiveness in the Russian peer-reviewed journal market; an overweighted share of non-original research with dubious contribution to science development. The breakthrough in the field may be caused by intensified competitiveness among Russian peer-reviewed journals, a breakaway from unscrupulous publishing practices towards journals' changed approaches to the quality of published articles, and authors' renewed attitude to conducting and documenting the results of their studies. The journals are to transfer from non-original and semi-structured science-like essays to original theoretical and empirical articles, with methodically based and discoursively appropriate structures typical of the world academic community. The article is based on the author's research of about 800 theoretical and empirical articles published in English in high-metrics sources indexed with the international databases. The author suggests a model adapting international expertise forRussia's present-day situation, gives detailed recommendations to journal editors and authors relating to articles on social sciences and humanities written in Russian, which enable to efficiently promote Russian journals in their indexation with the international databases",

This multidisciplinary project brings together the arts and humanities with the social sciences with their different epistemological philosophies and subsequent understandings of research methods. The main objective was to determine how visual arts activities may change, sustain and catalyse community cultures, beliefs, attitudes and behaviours to create dementia-friendly communities. This project involves 6 different UK universities, 14 researchers, 10 formal partners, 7 project artists, 3 research artists and a large number of civil society organisations. The analysis presents a series of themes that have been identified as influencing the approach taken to develop methods which aimed to speak to different audiences in the social sciences, arts and humanities, policy/practice and public domains. It is concluded that a research project of this type needs to embrace a wide variety of epistemological positions if it is to successfully achieve its objectives. This paper contributes to knowledge about how the methodology of large-scale multidisciplinary projects may be constructed which will be of value to those building research consortia across different universities and between universities and community partners.",

What characterizes the methodological preferences of humanities researchers: their choices of theory, empirical sources and analytical methods/techniques? And how have these preferences changed in recent years? This paper discusses the methods and results of a study of the methodological preferences of humanities researchers in Denmark. The study is based on a systematic reading of all humanities PhD dissertations defended at Danish universities between 1992 and 2012 (N=1,958). It uses simple descriptive statistics to analyze changes in the methodological preferences of humanities researchers during that period. One could say that the study combines a more humanistic approach (the reading of texts) with a more social scientific approach (statistical analysis). The main finding of the study is that ethnography is slowly replacing the interpretation of texts as the preferred methodology of humanities researchers, as the field moves into the 21st century. We discuss the historical conditions of these changes, including the influence from the intellectual current known as post-modernism and from research policy increasingly pressing for application-oriented research (as opposed to fundamental research). Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using PhD dissertations as a source for studying research practices in the humanities. We compare to other approaches, including bibliometric, ethnographic and survey-based.",

As a result, graduate students outside of these disciplines with an interest in the digital humanities must work within existing institutional structures and constraints to acquire the necessary training and methodological grounding that they need for their research. With these limitations in mind, in this paper I consider what it means to implement digital humanities approaches into graduate research in the variety of Modern Language departments that exist in the United States. More specifically, I address both the inherent risks and the potential rewards of such interventions. As a way of concluding, I discuss the unique affordances that emerge from encouraging the study of the digital humanities in Modern Language departments.",

The articles in this special issue represent a wide range of traditions and highlight several key conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and analytical issues related to defining and measuring engagement. All the approaches exemplified by the contributors show different ways of conceptualizing and measuring engagement and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of each method to significantly augment our current understanding of engagement. Despite the numerous issues raised by the authors of this special issue and in my commentary, I argue that focusing on process data will lead to advances in models, theory, methods, analytical techniques, and ultimately instructional recommendations for learning contexts that effectively engage students. ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI would like to thank Gale Sinatra and Doug Lombardi for their invitation to write the commentary and their comments and feedback on this article. Lastly, I would also like to thank Clark Chinn for his feedback on this commentary.Additional informationFundingThis work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, the Institute of Education Sciences, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",

However, the intricate nature of research methods in the social sciences and humanities often poses substantial difficulties for inexperienced researchers and may result in perplexity and mistakes. The objective of this study is to review the research methodology confusion among novice researchers in the social sciences and humanities. This study entails a content analysis approach to discovering pertinent material on the difficulties faced by inexperienced researchers in comprehending research methodology. This study has identified several points of research methodology confusion among novice researchers in the social sciences and humanities, namely: (a) normality tests and validity/reliability tests; (b) parametric and non-parametric tests; (c) sampling determination between experiments and social research; (d) literature review and manuscript analysis; (e) a review and an original qualitative paper; (f) specific terminology of research paper types; and (g) independent and dependent of sample and variable. In conclusion, this study reveals the widespread lack of clarity among inexperienced researchers in the social sciences and humanities when it comes to fundamental ideas, concepts, and research methods.",

      "abstract": "As a research methodology, walking has a diverse and extensive history in the social sciences and humanities, underscoring its value for conducting research that is situated, relational, and material. Building on the importance of place, sensory inquiry, embodiment, and rhythm within walking research, this book offers four new concepts for walking methodologies that are accountable to an ethics and politics of the more-than-human: Land and geos, affect, transmaterial and movement. The book carefully considers the more-than-human dimensions of walking methodologies by engaging with feminist new materialisms, posthumanisms, affect theory, trans and queer theory, Indigenous theories, and critical race and disability scholarship. These more-than-human theories rub frictionally against the history of walking scholarship and offer crucial insights into the potential of walking as a qualitative research methodology in a more-than-human world. Theoretically innovative, the book is grounded in examples of walking research by WalkingLab, an international research network on walking (www.walkinglab.org).\nThe book is rich in scope, engaging with a wide range of walking methods and forms including: long walks on hiking trails, geological walks, sensory walks, sonic art walks, processions, orienteering races, protest and activist walks, walking tours, derives, peripatetic mapping, school-based walking projects, and propositional walks. The chapters draw on WalkingLab\u2019s research-creation events to examine walking in relation to settler colonialism, affective labour, transspecies, participation, racial geographies and counter-cartographies, youth literacy, environmental education, and collaborative writing. The book outlines how more-than-human theories can influence and shape walking methodologies and provokes a critical mode of walking-with that engenders solidarity, accountability, and response-ability.\nThis volume will appeal to graduate students, artists, and academics and researchers who are interested in Education, Cultural Studies, Queer Studies, Affect Studies, Geography, Anthropology, and (Post)Qualitative Research Methods.",

      "abstract": "The article deals the analysis of the methodological base of the humanities and specific concepts used in the study of the dynamic aspects of the functioning of culture. It is stated that in connection with the expansion of the empirical base of socio-humanitarian research and the growing trend of interdisciplinarity in them, it seems necessary to constantly revise the applied methodologies and clarify the boundaries and functionality of a particular method. The study of sociocultural architectonics in general, and its dynamic aspects in particular, requires the correlation of scientific vocabulary with the politics of language, technology and values in the current cultural and historical realities. It is noted that today's changes and complications of the very object of study \u2013 culture \u2013 are associated with two main trends - the formation of the digital era paradigm and the transition from postmodernism to metamodernism. Studies of culture in all the variety of forms and modes of its existence almost always involve addressing the problem of historical time, identifying the dialectical nature of ongoing processes, understanding the ontological significance of dynamic aspects and, as a result, determining the specifics of the era, its \u201cspirit of the times\u201d. It is noted that one of the most effective approaches in the humanities is semiotic. In this research discourse, such concepts as \"cultural code\", \"text of culture\", \"artistic picture of the world\", \"national pictures of the world\" are actively used. It is proposed to introduce the \u201cartistic code of the era\u201d as a methodological concept, which makes it possible to more accurately designate artistic and figurative models of a certain period of cultural development, identified on the basis of an analysis of works of art, literature, trends in the world of fashion, design, advertising and other areas of social representation. All this correlates with the trend in the development of such scientific areas as visual studies and the social history of art, on the one hand, and with the rapid growth of the role of technology in the field of culture, on the other. The spread of digital methods of production, promotion and consumption of cultural products is the basis for the current state of culture in the mode of its industrialization. In this regard, the next concept proposed for use in the course of research on dynamic processes in culture is the blockchain approach. Obviously, there is a potential for its use in studying the sphere of artistic life in its entirety, including museum and exhibition, educational and educational activities, the practice of collecting works of art and organizing urban space as a sphere of representation of relevant ideas, values and meanings.",

It suggests that it might be positioned \u2018within, against, and beyond\u2019 current configurations of power in academia and society more broadly. It develops this argument by drawing on recent research funded through the UK\u2019s Connected Communities programme, led by the Arts and Humanities Research Council; and by attending to arguments from the field of Utopian Studies. It explores particular issues of power and control within the field of co-production, acknowledging that neoliberalism both constrains and co-opts such practice; and explores methodological and infrastructural issues such that its utopian potential might be realised.",

The authors present a systematic review of the literature, different research approaches and perspectives on tourism innovation; offer a synthesis of our findings and provide a discussion and proposals for future research. Design/methodology/approach Existing studies on innovation in hospitality and tourism (included in the Web of Knowledge database) were reviewed, and their limitations were identified. A procedure used in previous studies (Crossan and Apaydin, 2010; Tranfield et al. , 2003; Becheikh et al. , 2006) was applied. Moreover, aiming to reveal theoretical foundations of tourism innovation research and identify their structure, a bibliometric analysis was performed. Findings This paper identifies 152 published papers that represent the major efforts in expanding the body of research on innovation in hospitality and tourism. The importance of innovation for business and regional competitiveness and success has been recognised by both researchers and practitioners. In the papers included in the sample of this paper, the authors identified a general consensus that much remains to be done in the development of the theory of innovation in tourism. Through bibliometric analysis, nine co-citation networks, or clusters, were retrieved by applying co-citation relations among the most cited authors. The examination of these nine clusters revealed some dominant themes that characterise the field. Research limitations/implications The authors used three databases: Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index. While these databases may not include all relevant research, the authors, nonetheless, believe that by using a rigorous procedure in reviewing the literature systematically, they were able to reduce the probability of neglecting any information that would critically change the content of the present paper. Practical implications The aim of this paper was to bring together the prior research with presently existing models that may be used in further research. For the continuation of the research, the authors propose additional studies with the aim of theory development. By introducing new theoretical ideas and theoretical models, more qualitative and inductive research would help to stimulate further work. As stated above, researchers could go further by undertaking quantitative methods to empirically verify the theoretically proposed models. Originality/value Since the last review (Hjalager, 2010) of past studies in tourism innovation, mostly focusing on studies up to 2009, tourism innovation research has grown noticeably in terms of diverse topics. In this paper\u2019s database, the year with the most publications was 2012 with 48 papers, followed by 2014 with 42 (by 19 September), 2010 and 2011 with 41 and 2009 with 29. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no updated reviews focusing on innovation in tourism have been published recently. This study, consisting of a systematic review of academic literature, includes analyses of the international context, the methodology used, the points of view, the level of analysis (micro-level, macro-level and general level) and the type of innovation discussed in the paper. Moreover, the authors did not find any studies that used bibliometric analysis to identify the structure of the theoretical foundation of research in the area of innovation in tourism.",

Design/methodology/approach The academic communities of Norway have agreed on certain criteria for what should be included as original research publications in research evaluation and funding contexts. These criteria have been applied since 2004 in a comprehensive bibliographic database called the Norwegian Science Index (NSI). The relative coverages of Scopus and Web of Science are compared with regard to publication type, field of research and language. Findings Our results show that Scopus covers 72 percent of the total Norwegian scientific and scholarly publication output in 2015 and 2016, while the corresponding figure for Web of Science Core Collection is 69 percent. The coverages are most comprehensive in medicine and health (89 and 87 percent) and in the natural sciences and technology (85 and 84 percent). The social sciences (48 percent in Scopus and 40 percent in Web of Science Core Collection) and particularly the humanities (27 and 23 percent) are much less covered in the two international data sources. Research limitation Comparing with data from only one country is a limitation of the study, but the criteria used to define a country\u2019s scientific output as well as the identification of patterns of field-dependent partial representations in Scopus and Web of Science should be recognizable and useful also for other countries. Originality/value The novelty of this study is the criteria-based approach to studying coverage problems in the two data sources.",

By providing a comprehensive review of available literature, drawing on national and international experiences, we take a systematic look at the impact agenda within SSH. The primary objective of this article is to examine key methodological components used to assess research impact comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The study finds that research impact is a highly complex and contested concept in the SSH literature. Drawing on the strong methodological pluralism emerging in the literature, we conclude that there is considerable room for researchers, universities, and funding agencies to establish impact assessment tools directed towards specific missions while avoiding catch-all indicators and universal metrics.",

      "abstract": "Objectives The rise of medical humanities teaching in medical education has introduced pressure to prove efficacy and utility. Review articles on the available evidence have been criticised for poor methodology and unwarranted conclusions. To support a more nuanced discussion of how the medical humanities work, we conducted a scoping review of quantitative studies of medical humanities teaching. Methods Using a search strategy involving MEDLINE , EMBASE and ERIC , and hand searching, our scoping review located 11 045 articles that referred to the use of medical humanities teaching in medical education. Of these, 62 studies using quantitative evaluation methods were selected for review. Three iterations of analysis were performed: descriptive, conceptual, and discursive. Results Descriptive analysis revealed that the medical humanities as a whole cannot be easily systematised based on simple descriptive categories. Conceptual analysis supported the development of a conceptual framework in which the foci of the arts and humanities in medical education can be mapped alongside their related epistemic functions for teaching and learning. Within the framework, art functioned as expertise, as dialogue or as a means of expression and transformation. In the discursive analysis, we found three main ways in which the relationship between the arts and humanities and medicine was constructed as, respectively, intrinsic, additive and curative. Conclusions This review offers a nuanced framework of how different types of medical humanities work. The epistemological assumptions and discursive positioning of medical humanities teaching frame the forms of outcomes research that are considered relevant to curriculum decision making, and shed light on why dominant review methodologies make some functions of medical humanities teaching visible and render others invisible. We recommend the use of this framework to improve the rigor and relevance of future explorations of the efficacy and utility of medical humanities teaching.",

      "abstract": "Descriptive studies of general and discipline-specific academic writing genre conventions have paved the way for pedagogical materials that build real-world skills for novice academic writers. To name some better-known cases, breakthroughs have taken place in this regard in the fields of psychology, engineering, and chemistry. However, attested scholarship on rhetorical patterns in humanities writing, such as published literary criticism (hereafter ?LC?) is less common. This dearth of research affects scholars of literature produced by Spanish-speakers who write in both English and Spanish. Many L1 Spanish user scholars must often publish their research in English, rather than Spanish, to maintain institutional employment. Postsecondary Spanish majors in the U.S. must also demonstrate competence in literary criticism to gain credentials. To address the needs of these groups, the present study examines the potential of lexical bundles, qualitative content, and multidimensional analyses to help describe LC from a lexico-grammatical perspective. Such findings may facilitate an arrival at a comprehensive schematic of strategies used by expert-level literary scholars in Spanish and English. First, using multidimensional analysis, linguistic features characteristic of literary criticism writing are analyzed and interpreted in the context of prior multidimensional analyses to offer insight on ways in which the written norms of LC compare to those espoused in other genres previously analyzed. Next, the study examines the syntactic structures and functions of lexical bundles used in English and Spanish LC writing, with particular attention to quasi-equivalent and language-specific bundles. Finally, the study proposes a taxonomy of communicative strategies utilized by literary scholars in their arguments. Devised via qualitative content analysis, this taxonomy may extend the functional analysis of bundles in LC. These findings offer further insight into the macrostructures of literary criticism, as well as the sentence-level strategies that serve as building blocks for expert-level writing in the genre.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Consensus conferences, evidence-based medicine, translational medicine, and narrative medicine are among the most prominent new methods in medicine. This book explores their origins and aims, their epistemic strengths, and their epistemic weaknesses. The book argues that the familiar dichotomy between the art and the science of medicine is not adequate for understanding this methodological pluralism. The book begins by tracing the development of medical consensus conferences, from their beginning at the United States\u2019 National Institutes of Health in 1977, to their widespread adoption in national and international contexts. It discusses consensus conferences as social epistemic institutions designed to embody democracy and achieve objectivity. Evidence-based medicine, which developed next, ranks expert consensus at the bottom of the evidence hierarchy, thus challenging the authority of consensus conferences. Evidence-based medicine has transformed both medical research and clinical medicine in many positive ways, but it has also been accused of creating an intellectual hegemony that has marginalized crucial stages of scientific research, particularly scientific discovery. Translational medicine is understood as a response to the shortfalls of both consensus conferences and evidence-based medicine. Narrative medicine is the most prominent recent development in the medical humanities. Its central claim is that attention to narrative is essential for patient care. The book argues that the differences between narrative medicine and the other methods have been exaggerated, and offers a pluralistic account of how all the methods interact and sometimes conflict. The result yields suggestions for how to improve medical knowledge and understand medical controversies.",
