Stitzlein's Teaching Honesty in a Populist Era: Emphasizing Truth in the Education of Citizens, concentrating on \"The Role of Honesty in Teaching About Controversial Issues.\" Emphasizing what I call \"zetetic avoidance creep\" (ZAC), the review explores how teachers may either consciously or unconsciously drift from open inquiry toward more superficial, more palatable educational discourse to maintain harmony. Stitzlein's chapter offers a compelling case for preserving honest engagement \u2014 even with divisive topics \u2014 to bolster democratic and intellectual endeavors. By analyzing three key passages, I underscore Stitzlein's emphasis on transparency and robust debate, concluding with reflections on ZAC's broader implications for educational practice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this paper is to advance understanding of intellectually virtuous honesty, by examining the relationship between a recent account of intellectual honesty and a recent account of intellectual transparency. The account of intellectual honesty comes from Nathan King, who adapts the work of Christian Miller on moral honesty, while the account of intellectual transparency comes from T. Ryan Byerly. After introducing the respective accounts, I identify four potential differences between intellectual honesty and intellectual transparency as understood by these accounts. I then turn to the question of how to think about the relationship between these traits in light of these potential differences. I make the case that intellectual transparency can either be regarded as an exceptionally strong or ideal variety of intellectual honesty, or it can be regarded as a distinct virtue from intellectual honesty which is a more cardinal virtue than the latter. Along the way, I also note some places where a case can be made that Miller's and King's accounts of honesty and intellectual honesty are in need of refinement or clarification.",

      "abstract": "This article addresses the epistemological problem of cognitive biases \u2013 systematic errors in human reasoning that significantly distort the acquisition, justification, and communication of knowledge. Drawing on recent research in psychology and epistemology, the study focuses on three widespread biases: confirmation bias, belief bias, and the framing effect. These distortions lead to epistemically flawed inferences, undermine logical consistency, and often resist rational correction, thus posing a fundamental threat to intellectual integrity. The aim of this study is to examine the concept of logical honesty as a possible solution to this problem. Introduced in a previous work by the author, logical honesty is defined as a relational-procedural epistemic virtue that integrates three key dimensions: formal rationality (logical rigor), ethical responsibility (truth-directed motivation), and metacognitive reflexivity (awareness of one\u2019s epistemic fallibility and commitment to self-correction). This virtue is explored here as both an individual discipline and a normatively guided practice that enhances the reliability and integrity of reasoning processes. The study is theoretical and conceptual in nature. It synthesizes philosophical accounts of epistemic virtues \u2013 especially in the works of Linda Zagzebski and Jason Baehr \u2013 with findings from cognitive psychology. Through conceptual analysis, the article reconstructs the structure of logical honesty and examines its function as an epistemic defense mechanism against distortions of reasoning. In particular, it shows how logical honesty counteracts cognitive biases by promoting critical self-evaluation, open-mindedness, intellectual accountability, and logical discipline. The main body of the article analyzes how logical honesty addresses specific distortions. In the case of confirmation bias, it encourages systematic testing of counterevidence and correction of motivated reasoning. Against belief bias, it emphasizes logical validity over intuitive plausibility. Regarding the framing effect, it fosters reflective distance from rhetorical manipulations. In each case, logical honesty operates not only as a moral commitment but also as a practical method of improving epistemic reliability. The article concludes that logical honesty is not a formal norm or a stable personal trait, but a situationally activated epistemic virtue. It becomes relevant precisely in moments of cognitive tension and epistemic uncertainty \u2013 when the subject must choose between comfort and truth. In this way, logical honesty emerges as a core condition for epistemic maturity and a reliable defense against bias-driven fallacies in both individual and collective reasoning.",

The purpose of this research is to initially query the issue of Dante\u2019s potential retraction of previously adopted Averroistic positions in the Commedia, and then to examine in greater detail the relationship between the Florentine poet and the Brabantian philosopher. United by the thematic and autobiographical thread of knowledge persecuted by power, embodied in the history of both figures, the proposed viewpoint is that Dante finds a model of intellectual honesty and freedom in Siger\u2019s thought, ready to question even the authority of Aristotle, a model that Dante admires, places in Paradise, and upon which he structures his poema sacro. In conclusion, this work suggests a reading of some paradigmatic and antithetical pairs in the Commedia, linked by common principles yet opposite destinies, including Dante himself.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper investigates Nietzsche\u2019s assessments of Pascal\u2019s embrace and rejection of various branches of skepticisms that Montaigne embodies or ignores. Nietzsche admires Pascal for intellectual probity and skepticism. Pascal finds fault with Montaigne\u2019s Academic Skepticism, viewing it as insufficiently honest, because it ceases to inquire into Nature, and takes the self as the anchor of psychological tranquility. Inspired by Pascal\u2019s criticism of Montaigne\u2019s Skepticism in his Essais III.13, in D 46, Nietzsche also disapproves of Montaigne\u2019s sluggish tranquility and deems this a symptom of feebleness and nihilism. Some scholars claim that Nietzsche admires Montaigne\u2019s earthly cheerfulness and probity as that of a free spirit regarding Montaigne\u2019s adoption of Pyrrhonian. By contrast, I argue that Nietzsche misinterprets Montaigne\u2019s Academic Skepticism in the Essais III.13.1218 as Pyrrhonian Skepticism, because the Skepticism here is characterized by ignorance and incuriosity instead of probity. Montaigne\u2019s very Academic Skepticism vexes Pascal because of the latter\u2019s complacent lack of curiosity about the supernatural world. Regarding this, Nietzsche inveighs against Pascal\u2019s insufficient honesty as entangled with a dogmatic observance of Christian truthfulness instead of a free-spirited honesty, but advocates Montaigne\u2019s this-worldly naturalism. Nietzsche sees Pascal\u2019s unyielding application of Christian self-examination will finally lead to his skepticism of Christianity.",

Recently, Kotzee et al. (2021) argued that \u2018the intellectual virtues approach does not have available a suitably effective pedagogy to qualify the acquisition of intellectual virtue as the primary aim of education\u2019 (p. 1). In this article, partly as a response to Kotzee et al.'s (2021) challenge and partly to better understand and shape the intellectual virtues classroom, I explore at a pedagogical and epistemological level two theories I believe to be evident in the intellectual virtues classroom: virtue responsibilism and social constructivism. Through bringing these theories into conversation, I argue that a deeper understanding of the intellectual virtues classroom is elicited which is able to overcome Kotzee et al.'s (2021) pedagogical challenge for the intellectual virtues approach.",

This paper aims to further advance understanding of intellectual transparency by examining some of the ways in which the trait is instrumentally valuable. Specifically, I argue that intellectual transparency tends to enhance its possessor\u2019s close personal relationships, work performance, and civic engagement. On account of their intellectual transparency, the intellectually transparent person is likely to enjoy better quality, more satisfied personal relationships such as romantic relationships and friendships. They are likely to contribute to better work outcomes, especially when working in a team context. And, they are likely to be more civically active and to promote epistemic values of democratic deliberation.",

This is puzzling since intellectual honesty is a component of the will to truth. In this paper, I show that this puzzle tells us something important about how Nietzsche conceives of our pursuit of truth. For Nietzsche, those who pursue truth occupy unstable ground, since being honest about the ultimate reasons for that pursuit would mean that truth could no longer satisfy the important human needs it satisfies at present. We can pursue truth, or be honest about what in us is served by such a pursuit, but not both. Nietzsche aims to show that understanding and owning up to this instability is the sort of affirmation of human life to which we ought to aspire, and is the price we pay for being free from otherworldly morality.",

      "abstract": "Most critics of architecture agree that Ruskin has a positive impact on architecture just as he hurts it. His treatises are sometimes superficial, extremist, individualistic, and opposing one of them to the other, which led some critics to attack him harshly and stand against him. Ruskin lived in a crowded with different intellectual and sometimes contradictory climates and saw many thought, politics, sociology, science, and industry changes. Ruskin was only the victim of ideological dualism, which caused some of his treatises\u2019 contradiction and superficiality despite others\u2019 depth. Ruskin\u2019s theoretical aspect was not complete with the practical aspect because he never cared about applied arts. Ruskin represented what might be called \u201cman of letters,\u201d interested in many diverse topics as the diversity of human life itself. The research aims to reveal contradictions, superficiality, specifically, those implied in the chapter of \u201cLamp of Truth,\u201d and try to return them to the duality of his ideology or the gap between theory and practice that he suffers from it or both. This research is not an attempt to seek excuses to Ruskin, but an attempt to understand his treatises, thus enabling the man not to be enthusiastic to all his treatises without discrimination for the reference of any of them and vice versa be entirely opposed. The internal view of Ruskin\u2019s thoughts enables a profit gained from those that are immortal, which makes him considered among the great philosophers and thinkers of different ages and eras.",

I argue against such interpretations by highlighting three strands of Nietzsche\u2019s concept of honesty which they fail to accommodate (cf. GS 2, GS 335, BGE 230). I interpret Nietzsche\u2019s concept of honesty against the background of his drive psychology and show that it applies not only to reflective cognitive processes but also to unconscious cognitive processes. In concluding, I explain the key role which honesty plays in Nietzsche\u2019s project of translating \u2018man back into nature\u2019 (BGE 230).",

This paper explores the issue of authenticity in AI-assisted academic writing, as well as the potential risks to the value of intellectual creation. While the current legislation on artificial intelligence and copyright is still under development, with countries recognizing the need to adapt existing legal frameworks to accommodate the changes brought about by AI advancements, universities are trying to find new ways of fighting the escalating AI-plagiarism phenomenon. Authenticity is a measure of both integrity and value in academic research, envisaged as proof of researchers\u2019 academic honesty, originality of their creation, truthfulness and verifiability of the scientific data. The paper proposes the use of authenticity criteria when evaluating students\u2019 written academic assignments, criteria that can help educators to distinguish between original creation and AI-generated content. While acknowledging the technical utility of AI systems, the paper argues that human attribution and authenticity are the only qualities that can grant value to academic writing.",

The life trajectory of this \u2018idealist\u2019 of iron rigour and intellectual honesty spans almost a century of political, social and cultural revolutions, in which her figure is anything but peripheral. Close not only to Nietzsche, but to leading figures of the century, from Wagner to Mazzini, from Garibaldi to the anarchist Herzen, Malwida is a Person in the truest sense of this term. \u2018Voil\u00e0 un homme\u2019 one might say of her, if it were not odd to refer to the theorist of the \u2018superior woman\u2019 in this way.
