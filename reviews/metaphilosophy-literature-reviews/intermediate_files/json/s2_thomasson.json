      "abstract": "The twelfth volume of Oxford Studies in Metaphysics begins with a debate between Amie Thomasson and Ross Cameron on the nature of metaphysics. In short, Thomasson defends her \u201ceasy ontology\u201d position that there are no substantive metaphysical questions and argues against Cameron's position, according to which truthmaker questions are not easy. Cameron responds by criticizing Thomasson's easy ontology and defending truthmaker metaphysics. This paper defends Thomasson. Specifically, it argues that Cameron (1) distorts epistemic two\u2010dimensionalism's notion of epistemic possibility, (2) falls prey to the Picture Theory of language he claims (rightly) to reject, and (3) begs the question against Thomasson by assuming that her modal normativism is false. The defense is valuable more widely because it clarifies the relations between easy ontology, modal normativism, truthmaker metaphysics, and two\u2010dimensional semantics.",

      "abstract": "According to many so\u2010called anti\u2010representationalists, once one gives up on the idea that language functions by standing in genuine semantic relations to bits of the world, many of the traditional projects of metaphysics lapse (see, e.g., Price 2004). Amie Thomasson also subscribes to anti\u2010representationalism but has her own take on metaphysics. Traditional metaphysics is certainly suspect, but many questions of ontology can be resolved by what Thomasson calls the \u201ceasy\u201d approach, which sees questions about existence as following from the understanding of our own language plus relevant empirical input. Thomasson argues further that we should construe what appear to remain contentious metaphysical issues not as concerning inquiries into hidden truths but as instead veiled \u201cmetalinguistic negotiations\u201d (Plunkett and Sundell 2013) with pragmatic aims in mind. The present paper takes the view that this line threatens to render philosophy largely irrelevant to culture: to reduce the philosopher to a kind of political activist. But nor, it argues, is Thomasson's way of holding open the door for contentious metaphysical debate the only one for anti\u2010representationalists.",

It vindicates the disquiet felt by many people about contemporary metaphysical wrangles over the existence of numbers, propositions, \u2018arbitrary sums\u2019, and the like. Yet it does not require the reader to countenance anti-realism, relativism, or multiple types of existence. It even leaves some honest toil for metaphysicians to do once the dust has settled, so long as we do not get ideas above our station. Thomasson provides a powerful critique of mainstream approaches to ontology, and I am tempted to suggest an alternative title for future reprints: \u2018Ontologists Made Uneasy\u2019.",

      "abstract": "In the paper, a question of the ontological status of fictional characters is presented from the point of view of artifactual abstractionism. Artifactual abstractionism is Amie Thomasson\u2019s view that claims that fictional characters are abstract beings created by an author, which makes them a part of our reality. Characters are temporal and can cease to exist, so they need real-world support to keep on existing. \nThis outlook is contrasted with Miguel de Unamuno\u2019s view on fictional characters that are consistent with the mentioned position, meaning Unamuno\u2019s artifactual abstractionism. Miguel de Unamuno\u2019s philosophical thought is to be found both in his fictional writings and non-fictional texts. So, the paper's methodology is to extract Unamuno\u2019s metaphysical positions from the spectrum of his texts and contrast them with Thomasson\u2019s Artifactual Abstractionism. \nThe paper has two aims: (1) to show that fictional texts can be a viable source of an author\u2019s metaphysical insights and (2) to present those insights in contrast with philosophical texts. The conclusion is that Miguel de Unamuno presents similar ontological theories of fictional characters to the ones of Amie Thomasson\u2019s view. Additionally, it is to be proved that analytical theories are not far from literature. Both sources can be compared and make the understanding of ontological problems regarding fiction more complete.",

The central way of answering it has been to consider which entities we must posit as part of a best total explanatory theory. This paper argues against this \u2018explanatory\u2019 conception of metaphysics, by showing that it relies on an unarticulated assumption that all the terms at issue in these metaphysical debates serve an explanatory function. Making use of work in systemic functional linguistics enables us to identify the many different functions played by terms of interest in metaphysics. And that makes it clear that \u2018contribution of explanatory power\u2019 should be rejected as an across-the-board criterion in ontology. This work in functional linguistics also enables us to see why it is useful to have a language that entitles us to useredundant inferences to introduce terms for properties, numbers, and the like, giving us new reason to accept \u2018easy\u2019 inferences that there are such things. As a result, we should give up thinking that \u2018what is there?\u2019 provides a deep and interesting question for a discipline called \u2018ontology\u2019 to answer, and give up thinking that the task for ontology is to determine which entities to \u2018posit\u2019 as part of a best total explanatory theory.",
