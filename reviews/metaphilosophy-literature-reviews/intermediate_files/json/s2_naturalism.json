      "abstract": "Recently, the method of conceptual analysis as the presumed method of analytic jurisprudence has come under attack by Brian Leiter. Relying on W.V.O. Quine\u2019s naturalized epistemology displacing analytic-synthetic distinction on truth, Leiter offered the rejection of conceptual analysis and the adoption of naturalist method committed to doing empirical research in pursuit of providing cause-effect type of explanations in law. He argues that since conceptual analysis relies on the a priori intuitions of the conceptual theorist, this method fails to deliver the universal and necessary truths it set out to deliver. In this essay, I will analyse whether the charges Leiter levels at conceptual analysis stick to it. Drawing on the works of contemporary conceptual jurisprudents, I will conclude that conceptual analysis is secure from the defects that Leiter accuses it to have. I will argue that the questions the naturalist method and the method of conceptual analysis can succeed to answer are different sorts of questions about the law; conceptual analysis does proceed on a posteriori reasoning and its arguments are best construed as necessary truths upon contingent grounds. As a result, the naturalist method fails to replace the method of conceptual analysis.",

Quine calls some general methods of science maxims: general defeasible principles that call on us to approximate, maximize, or minimize a state and that are interpreted and weighed in context-sensitive ways. On my reading, his empiricism asks us to maximize accepting overall theories empirically equivalent to ours but to minimize accepting sentences that both do not affect the empirical content of our overall theory and do not simplify our overall theory. His naturalism asks us to maximize accepting sentences that are solely supported by standards that support our best current scientific theory. Drawing on the Quine archive at Houghton Library at Harvard, I support and apply these interpretations by investigating his rapidly evolving later work on empirical content and empirical equivalence, including some of his views on translation in this later work and his vacillation between what he calls the ecumenical and sectarian attitudes.",

Contrary to the image of a rigid physicalist, Quine's methodological continuity and fallibilism permit provisional inclusion of any entity, \u201cphysical\u201d or not, when theoretically and empirically fruitful. His resolve to start \u201cin the middle\u201d and treat philosophy as continuous with science contrasts with stricter naturalisms that categorically dismiss paranormal claims. Simultaneously, Quine rejects a priori philosophical pronouncements, denying autonomous or irreducible normativity beyond empirical science. Distinguishing Quine's \u201csoft\u201d naturalism from reductive physicalism and liberal naturalist views, the paper shows his position as inclusive regarding empirically testable phenomena yet methodologically monistic in privileging science as ultimate arbiter of ontological disputes. Quine's openness to unconventional hypotheses underscores that naturalism need not be metaphysically dogmatic but must remain anchored in empirical inquiry.",

Primarily, these discussions converge in the widely held view that naturalism is the only way for religious studies as an academic enterprise to exclude supernaturalist assumptions from its methodology. While I fully agree with this view, I argue that naturalism is usually formulated with the help of metaphysical assumptions, which are problematically embodied in the location problem, that is, the problem of how to locate certain phenomena, such as meanings and values, in the order of nature. By unfolding the dynamic between the elements of the location problem, I show that the kind of naturalism based on Wittgenstein\u2019s thought prevents the location problem from arising and can serve as a balanced version of naturalism for use in the study of religion. While metaphysical naturalism often leads to dilemmas, within Wittgenstein\u2019s kind of naturalism, it seems possible both to maintain anti-supernaturalism in the study of religion and to resist the metaphysical temptations hidden in our assumptions about language. These two features make Wittgenstein\u2019s naturalism truly methodological.",

      "abstract": "Philip Kitcher, in his book The Ethical Project (2011), outlined an ethical theory built on the foundation of pragmatic naturalism. In it, he tries to merge the pragmatism of John Dewey and the philosophy of naturalism. Despite its notability as an extensive contribution to naturalistic ethics, few criticisms against his ethical theory have been made on the basis that it fails to avoid the naturalistic fallacy (Derpmann et al. 2013). Others like Barresi (2017) observe that pragmatic naturalism does not give its proper due to individual moral contribution by stressing social-level phenomena too extensively. This paper will review these criticisms. Firstly, it will argue that alleging pragmatic naturalism of committing a naturalistic fallacy would miss the point of Kitcher\u2019s methodology, since its aim is not to invalidate the fact and value dichotomy by offhandedly deriving one from the other, but to show that a big chunk of observable moral knowledge is lost when we completely try to avoid it. Secondly, we will try to argue that focusing on social-level phenomena does not amount to discrediting individual agency.",

Bakhtari is one of the pioneers of contemporary Persian-Dari poetry in naturalism, imagery, and ideation. He is considered a poet of all times and places of his era. The findings of this study indicate that nature, through Bakhtari's poetry, reflects a vibrant spectrum of artistic, literary values, and aesthetic manifestations within the rich vocabulary of today\u2019s Ghazal. Bakhtari is a poet who is people-oriented, socially aware, culturally rooted, and committed to authenticity; these elevated intellectual traits transform him into a poet full of passion and excitement. The rationale for this exploration is based on the essence of the patterns of nature and their functions in Bakhtari's poetry, prompting the researcher to examine and identify the application of nature and naturalism in his works. The methodology employed in this research is descriptive-analytical with a referential approach. This study focuses on the poetic evidence of Afif Bakhtari and aims to identify which patterns of nature and naturalism have emerged in his verses.",

Foucault\u2019s work has long been suspected of reducing knowledge to power, and thus collapsing into unconstrained relativism and methodological incoherence. These concerns are predicated on a misunderstanding of Foucault\u2019s overall approach, which takes the form of a historico-critical project rather than a normative epistemology. However, Foucault does sometimes make normative epistemological judgements, especially about the human sciences. Furthermore, there are outstanding questions about what secures the descriptive rigour of the genealogical method. To address these issues, I develop two claims that will significantly enrich our understanding of Foucault\u2019s methodology. The first is that Foucault\u2019s respect for the natural sciences is crucial in making sense of his normative epistemological judgements. The second is that the descriptive rigour of his genealogical method derives from the fact it is modelled on empirical inquiry.",

Although the sciences have a progressive history, with later theories largely building on earlier ones, and a tremendous amount of agreement within the scientific community about the approximate truth of current theory, philosophy is different. We do not see a progressive history of philosophical theorizing, and there is little agreement within the philosophical community about which theories are even roughly correct. This not only encourages a certain skepticism about the possibility of philosophical knowledge, but a real question about whether the activity of philosophical theorizing is intellectually legitimate. It is argued here that there are features of a naturalistic methodology in philosophy which have the resources to respond to these concerns.",

In particular, I will proceed as follows. First, I will outline the main features of the contemporary metaphilosophical debate. Second, I will discuss some important metaphilosophical interpretations of Hegel. Third, I will specify in what sense it is possible to speak of a Hegelian metaphilosophy. Fourth, I will address several methodological issues that arise whenever one attempts to assert the contemporary relevance of Hegel\u2019s philosophy. Finally, I will assess to what extent Hegel\u2019s philosophy can be relevant for the current metaphilosophical debate. As a result, the present paper outlines a concrete option for current philosophical research.",

To this end, I discuss three recent studies that attempt to ascertain the intuitions of competent speakers on three longstanding conceptual disputes about law: two attempt to show our folk concept of law is antipositivist, whereas the other attempts to show our folk concept of law is consistent with the existence of sanction-less legal systems. I argue that all three studies suffer from defects indicating the empirical methodology of experimental jurisprudence can supplement, but cannot replace, the traditional philosophical methodology for addressing conceptual questions. I argue, finally and far more worrisomely, that the last study calls into question its usefulness even in supplementing the traditional philosophical methodology.",

Methodological naturalism, which is intended to operate independently of metaphysical claims, offers a neutral stance on the existence of deities; maintaining the empirical integrity of the scientific method. In examining four leading models of divinity, this paper assesses their potential to align with methodological naturalism while preserving divine attributes of infinity and benevolence. The paper then argues that, of the four, panentheism provides the most suitable framework for the integration of such a deity into a methodologically naturalistic framing. The combined model maintains the empirical constraints of methodological naturalism while allowing for a divine presence that embodies ultimate goodness in an infinite nature.",
