      "abstract": "Ever since the publication of Hunger of Memory in 1982, Richard Rodriguez has been read by scholars almost exclusively through the lens of identity politics. Twenty years later, in Brown, Rodriguez sought to reconcile some of the contradictions of identity, at least his own. Ultimately, Rodriguez concludes that the contradictions of identity cannot be reconciled. Our identities are always more complex and nuanced than the boxes we try to fit people in. In expressing his philosophy of identity, Rodriguez reflects on the concept of brownness and \u201cbrown thoughts,\u201d invoking brown as a metaphor for cultural miscegenation, and thereby for diversity and genuine inclusion. Rodriguez\u2019s philosophy of race, culture, and identity moves us beyond toxic forms of tribalism and cultural essentialism to an identity politics that unites rather than excluding and dividing.",

Park (Park, More than skin deep: A response to \u201cThe Whiteness of AI\u201d, Philosophy & Technology, 2021), and a development of our own 2020 paper \u2018The Whiteness of AI\u2019. We aim to explain how representations of AI can be varied in one sense, whilst not being diverse. We argue that Whiteness\u2019s claim to universal humanity permits a broad range of roles to White humans and White-presenting machines, whilst assigning a much narrower range of stereotypical roles to people of colour. Because the attributes of AI in the popular imagination, such as intelligence, power and passing as human, are associated by the White racial frame with Whiteness, AI is cast predominantly as White. Following Sparrow (Science, Technology, & Human Values 45:538\u2013560, 2020), we suggest this presents a dilemma for those creating or representing AI. We discuss three possible solutions: avoiding anthropomorphisation, explicitly critiquing racial role-typing, and representing powerful AI as non-White.",

      "abstract": "Today, firms\u2019 responsibility towards so\u00adciety exceeds the boundaries of \u201cpro\u00adviding goods and services to meet the needs of the society\u201d and \u201cobtaining a reasonable profit for the shareholders\u201d. Firms have further responsibilities to employees, customers, society and the natural environment. Carrying out these \u201csocial responsibilities\u201d affects the firms\u2019 image and reputation in the eyes of their various stakeholders. However, various audiences interpret the socially responsible actions of the firms in dif\u00adferent ways. One important factor that may cause this diversity is the moral philosophies of individuals, which is a concept used to determine different perspectives in ethical judgment. Per\u00adsonal moral philosophy is a key concept in understanding individual behaviour in various contexts, including consump\u00adtion and employment. According to Forsyth (1980), individuals\u2019 variations in their approach to moral judgments can be examined in two main dimen\u00adsions, namely idealism and relativism. This study examines the impact of the personal moral philosophies of young individuals on their intentions to pur\u00adchase services from, apply for jobs with and make investments in tourism com\u00adpanies that exercise socially responsible behavior. With this aim, a field study was conducted on 622 college students studying tourism and hospitality management at a state university in Turkey. A self-administered questionnaire was used as the data collection tool. The questionnaire had an excerpt describ\u00ading the socially responsible activities of a tourism firm and questions to capture the respondents\u2019 willingness to pur\u00adchase services from, apply for jobs with and invest in the described firm. Further questions were asked to identify the de\u00admographic characteristics and personal moral philosophies of the respondents. Regression analyses revealed that respondents\u2019 intentions to purchase ser\u00advices from the firm were positively af\u00adfected by idealism, while they were negatively affected by relativism. Inten\u00adtions to apply for a job with and invest in the company were positively affected by both dimensions of moral philoso\u00adphy. Theoretical and managerial impli\u00adcations of these findings are discussed. \u00a0 Actualment, la responsabilitat de les empreses enfront de la societat va m\u00e9s enll\u00e0 de \u201cproporcionar b\u00e9ns i serveis per satisfer les necessitats\u201c i \u201caconseguir uns guanys suficients per als accionis\u00adtes\u201d. \u00c9s un fet que les empreses tenen altres responsabilitats davant els em\u00adpleats, els clients, el seu entorn pr\u00f2xim i la societat en general. Complir amb elles degudament consolida la imatge i la reputaci\u00f3 de les empreses interna\u00adment i externament. Amb tot, no hi ha una visi\u00f3 homog\u00e8nia en la interpreta\u00adci\u00f3 sobre les accions de responsabilitat social. Un factor causant d\u2019aquesta di\u00adversitat d\u2019opinions \u00e9s la filosofia moral o \u00e8tica dels individus, un concepte que predetermina les diferents perspectives en el judici valoratiu. L\u2019\u00e8tica personal \u00e9s un concepte clau en la comprensi\u00f3 del comportament individual en diferents contexts, incloent-hi consum i ocupa\u00adci\u00f3. D\u2019acord amb autors com Forsyth, O\u2019Booyle i McDaniel (1980), les variacions individuals en l\u2019aproximaci\u00f3 als judicis morals poden ser examinades en dues dimensions fonamentals: l\u2019idealis\u00adme i el relativisme. Aquest estudi desco\u00adbreix l\u2019impacte de la filosofia moral en persones joves respecte a les seves in\u00adtencions de contractar serveis, sol\u2219licitar feines i tamb\u00e9 realitzar inversions en companyies del sector tur\u00edstic en el vessant del comportament de respon\u00adsabilitat social. Amb aquest objectiu, es presenta un estudi de camp a partir de 622 estudiants de turisme i gesti\u00f3 en hostaleria realitzat en una univer\u00adsitat estatal a Turquia. Un q\u00fcestionari en profunditat \u00e9s l\u2019eina per reunir les dades, afegint-hi un apartat on es des\u00adcriuen les activitats en l\u2019\u00e0mbit de res\u00adponsabilitat social d\u2019una companyia de turisme. Tamb\u00e9 s\u2019hi inclouen preguntes per tal d\u2019identificar les caracter\u00edstiques demogr\u00e0fiques i la filosofia moral de tots els participants. L\u2019estudi revela que les intencions de contractar serveis amb l\u2019esmentada companyia estan lligades en positiu a l\u2019idealisme i negativament al relativisme. Respecte a les intencions per sol\u2219licitar una feina o invertir en la firma es produeix una vinculaci\u00f3 positiva en ambdues dimensions de la filosofia moral. A partir d\u2019aquests re\u00adsultats es planteja un debat sobre les seves repercussions en el terreny te\u00f2ric i empresarial.",

But every issue concerning raceis an ethical issue, and it\u2019s time we studied them as such.\n Naomi Zack introduces students to historical and contemporary issues of race and racism and provides an ethical foundation for students to critically engage with these issues in the classroom and in their lives. The chapters discuss affirmative action and diversity, current protests from across the political spectrum, police killings, the relevance of race to the effects of disasters and climate change, white privilege as a cause for political impasse, racial identity (including mixed race identities), race and gender, and media representations of race.\n While treating issues of race as moral subjects with suggested moral foundations, Zack does not lead the student to specific conclusions. Rather, through thought, discussion, and writing questions, students learn to construct their own chains of reasonings based on explicit moral foundations.\n The book features:\nUp-to-date social and biological scientific findingsHot-button current issuesdiscussion questions and writing promptsfurther reading lists and video resourcesa comprehensive glossaryinternational examples to supplement US-based discussion",

In the context of Islamic education philosophy, multicultural education has a deep relevance and is in line with the basic principles of Islam that emphasize equality, justice, and equality among all humans regardless of race, ethnicity, or cultural background. Islam encourages its people to know and understand each other, in accordance with Allah's words in the Qur'an letter Al-Hujurat verse 13 which mentions the importance of knowing each other. Therefore, multicultural education in the Islamic perspective is not only a necessity in a plural society, but also part of the practice and demands of religion. The multicultural approach in Islamic education helps enrich students' understanding of diversity and teaches them to be tolerant and respectful of differences. Through this education, it is hoped that a harmonious, peaceful and respectful society can be realized in the midst of cultural and religious diversity \n Keywords: Multicultural Education, Islamic Education Philosophy, Education",

      "abstract": "Background: Indonesia is rich in diversity, which is caused by the spread of the population across many islands, so it has many differences in religion, ethnicity, race, and culture. The large number of differences will be vulnerable to division and intimidation. Aim: This research aims to integrate the values of the Huma Betang philosophy which is also embodied in the Bhinneka Tunggal Ika frame. This research uses a qualitative descriptive and literature study approach where researchers collect data from various literature sources and journals. Results and D\u0131scussion: The results of the research show that the philosophy of Huma Betang has the same meaning as the five precepts that Huma Betang has meaning 1) Belief in the Almighty God or Religious Values (Hatala) Dayak people believe in the existence of God; 2) Just and Civilized Humanity, the Value of Justice and Belom Bahadat which has the meaning of life must be fair to all God's people and have good manners; 3) Indonesian Unity or called Handep Hapakat & Isen Mulang, namely the spirit of cooperation and the spirit of never giving up; 4) Democracy led by the wisdom of decisions in representative deliberations, Hapakat Basara & Hupungkal Lingu Nalatai Hapangajan Karendem Malempang means uniting in resolving a problem by consensus so that everything can reach a common agreement; 5) Social Justice for all Indonesian People, also called Belum penyang hinje simpei or living in harmony and peace for the sake of shared prosperity. Conclusion: Huma Betang's philosophy has values that are relevant to Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, which is contained in the motto and ideological foundation of the Indonesian state. In the Huma Betang philosophy, it has the same meaning as the five precepts contained in Pancasila.",

      "abstract": "Human sexuality is different from other species in nature in that it is creative, accessible, and responsible; however, it is this creativity that makes sexual life differentiated, and sexual orientations become rich and diverse. Discrimination against people is not only about occupation, income, sexuality, or gender becomes discrimination against people. To achieve the goal of sustainable development, there is no discrimination against people, so this content is approached from the methodology of human philosophy and social philosophy, at the same time combining qualitative methods to analyze, synthesize, compare, contrast, and reverse to clarify the transformation of sexual life in the commodity economy. The result of this content is to explain that human sexual life is creative; it depends on the object of satisfaction. Sex does not depend on space, time, or specific objects, but occupation, goods, and money also govern the market economy. The conclusion of the article affirms that life is human satisfaction. Sexual satisfaction is not only human instinct but also human creativity. Human satisfaction differs from satisfaction with things without humans, which is satisfaction with loneliness, isolation, and unhappiness. Humans become different types of goods serving the life of money, posing a challenge to the goal of sustainable development in the commodity economy. However, there must be practical solutions to survive and maintain the race, bringing humans back to a creative sexual life and responsible reproduction to achieve the goal of sustainable development in the commodity economy.",

The \u2018philosophical who\u2019 and the \u2018philosophical what\u2019 themselves are a partial function of matters that have been passed over in collective silence, even if that now feels to some like a silence belonging to the distant past. This paper discusses some philosophical silences regarding race, gender, and disability in the context of reflection on philosophical education and on philosophical practice in the public sphere. It focuses on Charles Mills\u2019 writings on race, Susan Babbitt\u2019s on race and gender, and on more collaboratively-generated work on eugenics and disability.",

(2022) bring together a wide range of scholars\u2019 work on the inseparability of digital technologies with biological processes to unpack the influence of these interactions upon our knowledges. Reviewing an edited book is always a difficult task by attempting to weave one\u2019s own expertise while also sharing the book\u2019s contents. Depending on the book, one of these is more challenging than the other. The latter is unquestionably a more perplexing task for this volume due to its vast diversity of topics and authors\u2019 expertise and positionalities. If books could be weighed in terms of their depth and density in providing arguments, theorizing, philosophizing, and providing a diverse range of examples and disciplinary foci, this book would be exceptionally heavy. This massive weight is required as the book attempts to answer an important \u2018eternal question of [the] human race \u2013 the interplay between biology, information, and society\u2019 (Peters et al. 2022: v), as no amount of pages could completely answer this question. The editors frame bioinformational as the \u2018blurred and messy relationships between physics and biology, old and new media, humanism and posthumanism, knowledge capitalism and bio-informational capitalism\u2019 (Jandri\u0107 et al. 2018: 896). The sheer messiness of the intersectionalities between these relationships is withouta-doubt complex and is innately challenging to fully comprehend. However, the book\u2019s structure and the editors\u2019 introductions (book and parts) help guide readers through the topics. Threaded throughout the book is the notion that mystifying post/ biodigital effects upon knowledges is systematically utilized to intensify hegemony",

      "abstract": "The Ethical Concept has been a topic that has not lost its relevance throughout history. That is why it is an indispensable subject of research. The teachers of the philosophy group have a conceptual substructure regarding the concept of ethics. This substructure forms the ideology and perceptions of the philosophical group of teachers regarding the concept of ethics. Many studies have been conducted on ethics, including those of teachers, directors, and students. In literature, however, there is no study of a philosophical group to ensure that the concept of ethics is the subject of teaching. Based on the reasons stated, this study aims to examine the metaphorical perceptions of ethical status levels and the concept of ethics by the teachers of the philosophy group. The study was carried out using the parallel method of synchronization, with 107 philosophical group teachers working in the central districts of Adana, \u00c7ukurova, Sar\u0131\u00e7am, Seyhan and Y\u00fcre\u011fir in the educational year 2020-2021. Sample selection based on maximum diversity was made to determine participants. The study used the personal information form as a tool for data collection, the Ethics Position Questionnaire developed by Forsyth (1980), and the metaphor for the ethical concept developed by researchers. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 22 program. Qualitative data is dealt with together with metaphors and reasoning by means of content analysis. In the subsequent process, the qualitative and quantitative data sources were analyzed first separately and then jointly, and the analysis found that the demographic structure had no impact on ethical position levels, and that the sub-dimension of idealism was high on the ethical state levels of the participants compared to the relativistic sub-dimension. Participants produced a total of 68 different metaphors. The most widely used metaphor by the teachers of the philosophy group has been identified as the concept of \"human\". In addition, they consider the concept of ethics to be the most guiding and vital element.",

      "abstract": "Hypothesis is that global philosophy was formed in Andalusia in late middle Ages due to specific social changes in Andalusia. Change in science and especially philosophy is based on social context. Social context is caused by a kind of population diversity which is a ready field for a certain type of philosophical thinking and generally causes general flow of philosophy. Formation of three-religious society was a new social context that required the development of philosophy. Philosophy, as a tool for the dialogue of nations, initially played a role in place where Muslim, Christian, Jewish nations settled next to each other, and at the same time, a constructive interaction between philosophers of three religions was formed. And Averroes (1198),his student Jewish Ibn Maimon(1204), and the Christian Aquinas (1274)are symbols of dialogue between religious .Development of interaction is such that theologians of three religions appeared and even bookes beyond thoughts of three religions was compiled.and Averroes spirit philosophy of medieval ,by announcing independence of reason from religion, provided capital for discussion and also Aquinas tried to show this unity of religions and intellect by writing book \"Summa Theologica\". This article shows constructive interaction of philosophy and change in a historical event in late middle Ages, which is always possible to useful. Research is based on a report by Ibn Khaldun who said: Philosophy is dead in West of Islamic territories by Arab demographic composition and has awakened in Europe and in Iran is alive because of efforts of Nasir al-Din al-Tus(1274).",

      "abstract": "This article presents a new argument concerning the relation between Kant\u2019s theory of race and aspects of the critical philosophy. It argues that Kant\u2019s treatment of the problem of the systematic unity of nature and knowledge in the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of the Power of Judgment can be traced back a methodological problem in the natural history of the period \u2013 that of the possibility of a natural system of nature. Kant\u2019s transformation of the methodological problem from natural history into a set of philosophical (and specifically epistemological) problems proceeds by way of the working out of his own problem in natural history \u2013 the problem of the natural history of the human races \u2013 and specifically the problem of the unity in diversity of the human species, in response to which he develops a theory of race. This theory of race is, further, the first developed model of the use of teleological judgment in Kant\u2019s work. The article thus argues that Kant\u2019s philosophical position on the systematic unity of nature and of knowledge in the first and third Critiques, and his account and defense of teleological judgment, are developed out of problems first articulated in his solution to the problem of the unity in diversity of the human species \u2013 that is, in his theory of race. The article does not seek to establish that these aspects of the critical philosophy are therefore racialised. But it does demonstrate, against those who deny its salience to his philosophy, how the problem of the unity in diversity of the human species and Kant\u2019s theory of race is significant for the development of aspects of the critical philosophy and thus contributes to their philosophical problematics.",

      "abstract": "Some recent uses of artificial intelligence for (for example) facial recognition, evaluating resumes, and sorting photographs by subject matter have revealed troubling disparities in performance or impact based on the demographic traits (like race and gender) of subject populations. These disparities raise pressing questions about how using artificial intelligence can work to promote justice or entrench injustice. Political theorists and philosophers have developed nuanced vocabularies and theoretical frameworks for understanding and adjudicating disputes about what justice requires and what constitutes injustice. The interdisciplinary community committed to understanding and conscientiously using big data could benefit from this work. Thus, in the spirit of encouraging cross-disciplinary dialogue and collaboration, this piece examines contemporary scholarship in political theory and philosophy to illustrate some of the vocabularies and frameworks political theorists and philosophers have developed for thinking about justice and injustice. It then draws on these frameworks to illuminate how the use of artificial intelligence can implicate questions of justice, with a focus on institutional discrimination, structural injustice, and epistemic injustice. Ultimately, the piece argues that the use of artificial intelligence\u2014far from representing a decision to take power out of human hands\u2014represents a novel way of harnessing human power, making questions of justice central to its conscientious undertaking.",

      "abstract": "There are widespread calls for increased demographic diversity in science, often linked to the epistemic claim that including more perspectives will improve the quality of the knowledge produced. By distinguishing between demographic and epistemic diversity, we show that this is only true some of the time. There are cases where increasing demographic diversity will not bring about the necessary epistemic diversity and cases where failing to exclude some voices reduces the quality of the scientific debate. We seek to resolve these tensions with an analysis that turns on the way the experience-based expertise of non-scientists can be absorbed into mainstream science. Mostly it has to be done via what we call \u2018virtual diversity\u2019, in which scientists take responsibility for acquiring interactional expertise in the non-scientific expertise-based domains which they consider provide knowledge valuable to the science. We argue that virtual diversity represents the only feasible option in most scenarios, with cases where demographic diversity or full cultural mergers provide the solution being the exception rather than the rule. This analysis is an exercise in the sociology of knowledge, which is considered as being continuous with philosophy. The paper is prescriptive as well as descriptive, and the moral, cultural, political, and educational implications of the argument are drawn out. A main conclusion is that the acquisition of virtual diversity should be a new norm for science, allowing the voices of experienced non-scientist citizens to be heard but without eroding the institution of science, which continues to be a vital foundation of truth in democracy.",
