Approaching this philosophical tradition as a diverse set of philosophies that it is, The Bloomsbury Handbook of Pragmatism introduces many of the ideas and debates at the centre of the field today.\n Focusing on issues in different subject areas, this up-to-date handbook covers current research in aesthetics, economics, education, ethics, history, law, metaphysics, politics, race, religion, science and technology, language, and social theory. Supported by an introduction to research methods and problems, as well as a guide to past and future directions in the field, chapters are enhanced by a \u2018how to use\u2019 guide and glossary. Now expanded, this edition includes new chapters on pragmatism and various global and regional philosophical traditions, as well as feminism and environmental philosophy.\n Showing where important work continues to be done, the tensions that exist, and, most valuably, the exciting new directions the field is taking, The Bloomsbury Handbook of Pragmatism advances our understanding of the role of pragmatism in 21st century philosophy.",

It is not possible to provide a detailed overview of the covered areas here. For this review, I will focus on the following chapters: The first chapter (\u201cTheoretical-Epistemological Issues. In defense of philosophy and its didactics\u201d), the third chapter (\u201cCurrent issues\u201d), and the \u201ccritical annotations in the margin\u201d. Other topics such as historical developments in teaching philosophy (Chapter 2, \u201cHistorical-Critical Issues. A Brief History of Philosophy Teaching in Italy\u201d) will remain in the background. Other chapters will be dealt with selectively (Part Two: Chapter 4, \u201cIssues of Methods and Methodologies. Possible models of teaching philosophy\u201d; Chapter 5 \u201cConcrete issues and classroom practices. Technologies and techniques of teaching philosophy\u201d; Part Three: Chapter 6 \u201cDialogical issues. Philosophy, other pieces of knowledge, other languages\u201d). The reason is that the latter issues are as it seems to me much better known, while the former bring out more clearly the critical discussion that animates (thinking about) teaching philosophy. The starting point of the critical reflections in the Handbook is a \u201cphilosophical reading\u201d of the Italian National Guidelines (Indicazioni Nazionali, 2011) and of the so-called \u201cOrientations\u201d (Orientamenti, 2017) at the same time linked to university education purposes. The Handbook articulates three points of the Orientamenti:",

First, the chapter addresses the question, What is qualitative research? In answering the question, the chapter reviews the major elements of research: paradigm, ontology, epistemology (which together form the philosophical basis of research), genre, methods, theory, methodology (which operate at the level of praxis), ethics, values, and reflexivity (which merge the philosophical and praxis dimensions of research). Second, the chapter addresses the question, Who are qualitative researchers? The chapter explains qualitative research as a form of bricolage and qualitative researchers as bricoleurs. The remainder of the chapter reviews the contents of the handbook, providing a chapter-by-chapter summary.",

In this chapter, I outline four types of IP-law-and-philosophy scholarship, focusing specifically on the discipline of analytic philosophy (with appropriate caveats about the coherence of that discipline). These modes of scholarship can be categorized as: (1) the jurisprudence of the IP system; (2) philosophical analysis of IP law; (3) applied philosophy in IP; and (4) normative theory of IP. Category (4) is obviously a special case of category (3), focusing specifically on applications of moral philosophy. Within each category, I provide illustrative examples of past scholarship and suggestions for further research.",

However, the mixed methods field has been grappling with the challenge of demonstrating its foundation in philosophical or paradigmatic terms. To interrogate this subject of the MMR foundation, this chapter begins by tracing the evolution of MMR and then discusses why researchers find it attractive to use. The chapter moves to present the paradigmatic dilemma associated with the use of MMR. It also debates pragmatism as a philosophical position and questions whether pragmatism is an opportunistic paradigm for MMR. It produces a picture that shows the resultant logical challenge associated with MMR in practice. The chapter concludes by taking the position that it is not logically possible to carry out a study from the standpoint of a fence sitter. A researcher needs a stable disposition from which to think logically. The chapter adds weight to the growing body of MMR literature.",

      "abstract": "This study uses secondary data to discuss views of indigenous scholars on the importance of using African indigenous philosophies as underpinnings for indigenous research in order to reclaim the dignity of African indigenous knowledge. For many years, African indigenous knowledge has been marginalized and constructed using Western worldviews and methods. African indigenous philosophies were deemed non-existent and non-fitting to be in the academic space by many non-indigenous scholars who believed that indigenous research methods cannot be developed because there are no specific generalized frameworks. In correcting and reclaiming the knowledge and dignity of African indigenous knowledge, this study argues for the decolonization and indigenization of research by utilizing African indigenous philosophies which focuses on African philosophical beliefs and values, that constitute their own way of living, doing, and being. Such research will prevent indigenous people's knowledge from being misrepresented, divided, mystified, commodified, condensed, and misinterpreted.",

Lucian of Samosata was aware of Christian traditions and texts, but probably had not read any of the New Testament. His accusation that Christianity was not based on careful proof reappeared frequently in the critics who followed him such as Galen and Celsus. Porphyry, considered by the Christians to be their most dangerous critic, wrote a denunciation of their faith that still reverberates in biblical studies. Hierocles admired Apollonius of Tyana but not Jesus. Julian, called the Apostate, had read much of the LXX and NT and attacked Christian texts using literary and philosophical methods. Macarius\u2019 anonymous pagan philosopher read the NT closely, but his criticisms were not profound.",

This suggests that the two approaches differ in aims, methods, and subject matter. A closer look at the two disciplines reveals, however, that in terms of history, themes, and philosophical goals they have more in common than that which separates them. This chapter examines these differences and common features in the philosophy of Heidegger and Gadamer, then demonstrates how Ricoeur\u2019s hermeneutical phenomenology provides us with a dialectical account of personal identity that can contribute to phenomenological psychopathology. The combination of a phenomenological clarification of selfhood and a hermeneutical emphasis on interpretation paves the way for an interdisciplinary approach to mental illness.",

The author challenges the representation of alchemy as a superficial amalgam (or \u201csyncretism\u201d) of Greek philosophical theories. He argues for an indigenous Egyptian development of the art, rooted distantly in the artisanal traditions of the temples, and stresses the originality of alchemical matter theory, which drew creatively on Greek philosophical (especially Aristotelian) concepts. The alchemists were also innovative technicians, developing new methods and apparatus in pursuit of the goal of transmutation. These theoretical and technical innovations contradict the commonplace image of alchemy as an irrational pseudo-science. The esotericism of alchemy, far from undermining its rational development, served to stimulate research, since the secrets of the ancient masters could only be decoded in the light of laboratory experience. Alchemy does not provide evidence for a (supposed) decline into mystical obscurantism in the late ancient world.",

      "abstract": "Marcion of Sinope was active in Rome in the middle of the second century ce. Marcion\u2019s views on Scripture and hermeneutics led to a separation from the Church in Rome and the creation of a concurrent Marcionite community. This chapter examines Marcion\u2019s legacy within subsequent early Christian biblical interpretation, seen most clearly in his role as an early practitioner of philological reading techniques to interpret Scripture. This chapter considers Marcion\u2019s conception of the diversity of two gods\u2014the Creator and the unknown God\u2014in light of contemporary philosophy, and it suggests that Marcion\u2019s literary-critical methods were deployed to confirm this philosophical understanding of deity. After an analysis of Marcion\u2019s philology, seen in both his hermeneutical stance towards the Jewish Scriptures and his editorial work on the New Testament, this chapter concludes by arguing that writers like Tertullian and Epiphanius rejected Marcion\u2019s philosophical conclusions while coming to terms with the validity of the methods of philology for biblical interpretation.",

It returns to this debate to better articulate how the competition inherent in many codified dance forms is opposed to the kind of (un)disciplined labor involved in somatic-based practices. This labor engages sensory acuity to attend to somatic intelligence (bodily forms of knowledge) to access new information and possibilities. This project requires an extension of current terminology, specifically extending Foucault\u2019s notion of surveillance as a kind of self-surveillance, which can be further bifurcated as prohibitive and emancipatory.",

The second chapter considers Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophical critique of psychoanalysis and how he drew on Sigmund Freud\u2019s writings to test his new linguistic methods in philosophy. The third chapter describes how the Frankfurt School used Freudian psychoanalysis to bolster its Marxist critique of modern society, citing as an example Theodor W. Adorno, who offered an explanation of how fascist mass movements occurred by drawing on Freud\u2019s theory of narcissism. The last chapter discusses the key hermeneutic themes found in Paul Ricoeur\u2019s engagement with Freud in his book Freud and Philosophy.",

To effectively navigate this era, individuals need to develop critical thinking skills and self-awareness through philosophical methods. These methods, which are particularly relevant for the alpha generation growing up amidst information overload and technological advancements, can be introduced from early childhood. This study aims to introduce philosophical methods within the context of Christian Religious Education to empower the alpha generation in Society 5.0. The research utilizes qualitative methods, specifically a literature review, to propose three philosophical approaches for Christian Religious Education: the critical method, the intuitive method, and the dialectical method. By incorporating these educational philosophies, Christian Religious Education educators can strategize and adapt their teaching approaches to cater to the learning needs of the alpha generation within the framework of Society 5.0.",
