      "abstract": "\n \n \nThis paper grew from the imagining that Sara Ahmed and Michel Foucault, both influential scholars in my ever-developing understanding of the world, met face-to-face one ordinary day, discussed their ideas, responded to each other\u2019s queries, reflected on historical and ongoing social injustices, and shared hopeful imaginings for the future. In this imaginary account, through the form of dialogues, I compare, contrast, and examine concepts in Foucault\u2019s and Ahmed\u2019s works\u2014specifically, the chapter \u201cDocile Bodies\u201d in Discipline and Punish, published in 1977, and the book Living a Feminist Life, published 40 years later in 2017.1 Following Ahmed, I use path, walls, and tables as both metaphors and material effects of disciplinary power to link theorizations from the two texts regarding the embodiment of discipline, through which white, capitalist, and heteropatriarchal norms persist. Further, I ask questions of Foucault\u2019s text about the seeming invisibility of women and disabled people in its discussion of docile bodies and disciplinary power and echo other feminist scholars in arguing that it is through the perspectives and experiences of those who have been cast out of belonging and rendered invisible that we may find the means to expose the most cemented and hidden structures and techniques of domination and to imagine forms of resistance and subversions that point to a different future. For the purpose of clarity, direct quotes from Ahmed\u2019s and Foucault\u2019s texts are italicized within the dialogues, accompanied by in-text citations. \n \n \n",

Using the insights of material feminisms (Katherine Behar and Sara Ahmed), affect theory (Alex Houen), and the ethics of care (Mar\u00eda Puig de la Bellacasa), the essay delves into the collection\u2019s reclaiming of motherhood through its conspicuous rekindling of the corporeal and the material.",

      "abstract": "Jean Baudrillard\u2019s work has had a turbulent relationship with feminist thought. Victoria Grace attributes this turbulence to a general refusal on the part of feminist critics to engage, borrowing from Rex Butler, with Baudrillard \u201cin his own terms\u201d (1). In this essay, I challenge Grace\u2019s faith in Baudrillard\u2019s work to wrest feminist thought from the clutches of hyperreality. Conversely, I argue that Grace\u2019s lionization of Baudrillard\u2019s theories as a panacea to the problems facing contemporary society is itself a replication of the very model of hyperreality that she, and Baudrillard, decries. To argue this, I perform two operations. Firstly, I present Baudrillard\u2019s theory of the simulacrum arguing that its emergence does not mark the dissipation of the real in favor of the virtual but that it signals the emergence of a single world-view, or \u201cintegrated circuit,\u201d that is taken as objectively real. Secondly, I turn my attention to Sara Ahmed\u2019s feminist critique of Baudrillard\u2019s work in \u201chis own terms\u201d and how this critique informs a need to push Baudrillard\u2019s theories further than he himself pushed them. I conclude by suggesting that Baudrillard\u2019s theories can be\u2014and have been\u2014used by",

      "abstract": "Sara Ahmed is a feminist philosopher specializing in how the cultural politics of language use and discourse mediate social and embodied encounters with difference. She has published field-shaping contributions to queer and feminist theory, critical race and postcolonial theory, affect and emotion studies, and phenomenology. Since the publication of Differences that Matter: Feminist Theory and Postmodernism in 1998, her work has epitomized the value of contemporary feminist cultural studies to speak to and against the masculinist traditions of continental philosophy. Unequivocally inserting feminist politics into the rarified air of academic theory, it crosses the sexist boundary which corrals feminist thought into the category of \u201cstudies\u201d while opposing it to male-authored philosophy\u2014the latter automatically authorized to speak on the social and material \u201cReal.\u201d In doing so, her work sits squarely within discourse-analytical traditions that seek to expose how various epistemic scenes \u2013 activism, the media, and academia, to name a few -- sediment false authority on such issues as happiness, utility, and the good. Moreover, in contesting New Materialism\u2019s search for some monist \u201cmatter\u201d beneath experience, she traces how those linguistic moves impose insidiously singular concepts of what social \u201creality\u201d is, and how it unfolds, for real people. As a field, communication studies concerns itself centrally with matters of social influence, scale, and power, such as the electoral effects of political speech, or the ability of a message to morph as it reaches new audiences. Turning a critical eye upon the (re)production of cultural norms and social structure through interpersonal and institutional encounters, Ahmed\u2019s oeuvre explores the discursive logics and speech acts that sediment or transform the social meanings of race, gender, and other differences.",

It argues that Woolf\u2019s complication of love in the novel responds to three amorous \u2018needs\u2019 articulated, respectively, in the work of Rosi Braidotti, Eve Kosofksy Sedgwick and Sara Ahmed. In bringing Woolf\u2019s novel to the needs voiced by these theorists, the essay neither synthesizes Braidotti, Sedgwick and Ahmed nor privileges one of them above the others. It shows, rather, that Night and Day keeps love unmastered by any single critical paradigm and that its literary/conceptual work is best read in aggregate\u2009\u2013\u2009read and reread, that is, according to three often antagonistic frameworks between which the essay makes a temporary peace. The posthuman and queer frames bring to life Katharine Hilbery\u2019s powerful attachment to and preference for the study of mathematics and astronomy, her distaste for human beings (and literary studies), and her careful stagecraft in managing the people she loves. The feminist frame links the promises of love to the patriarchal/misogynistic division between the education of men and the training of women.",

Revisiting an often-cited text I wrote in 1994 called \u2018Spacemaking', which spoke from the experience of being a performer in the installation, I fill in what was missing, downplayed or unwelcome in the discourses of the time: that nobody is anybody (i.e. in technological environments bodies are never neutral or universal); and that artistic works are deeply contextual and intersectional. Taking a strongly political and contextual approach to Telematic Dreaming, I first reflect on the dual states of wonder & entitlement characterising digital experimentation of the 1990s then I consider the cultural structures and material infrastructures of the installation, assessing the scope for ontological expansiveness and gender crique they afforded. Beyond a particular instance of time-travel, this article proposes a new methodological framework for examining past performances. By turning to critical phenomenology, with contributions from feminist archaeology, media archaeology, and an unexpected appearance of Sara Ahmed\u2019s feminist killjoy, I offer an approach that paves the way for future researchers interested in engaging reflexively and critically with historical phenomenological analyses of artistic performance and of wider lived experiences.",

Post-truth, which is seen as a threat to reason, social cohesion, and fact-based knowledge claims, is either viewed as the outcome of the failure of our cognitive apparatus, or a consequence of our unchecked thirst for stories that provoke dramatic feelings. From a feminist point of view, this should give us pause, since the arguments used to dismiss post-truth resemble those that dismissed women\u2019s experiences and emotions as idiosyncratic or irrational. Have post-truth scholars been too hasty in their judgment of emotion-based knowledge claims? In this essay, I explore the transcendental role of emotion in its relationship to epistemic knowledge claims and argue that emotion should be given a more primordial status in the analysis of post-factuality. I do this by exploring the psychoanalytic and phenomenological analysis of affect, especially Sara Ahmed\u2019s feminist phenomenology of embodiment.",

Using Lauren Berlant\u2019s conception of neoliberal \u201ccrisis subjectivity\u201d and Sara Ahmed\u2019s vision of feminist wonderment as an antidote to the neoliberal \u201cpromise of happiness,\u201d it argues that each novel considers what might be salvaged and what might grow from situations in which young women become attuned to their mutual incarceration in neoliberal time\u2019s double bind. It contends that the forced improvisation and feminist reorientation undertaken by the protagonists can be analyzed through the lens of temporality. Finally, it contemplates how the disciplinary-specific modes through which the novels\u2019 protagonists consider temporality might be connected to the specific literary projects of their authors.",

      "abstract": "What counts as knowledge, expertise, and theory? How are knowledge hierarchies connected to emotional and hierarchies of subjects? How does the division between emotion and reason shape our experiences? The Element addresses these questions by exploring the Greek feminist birth control movement (1974\u20131986), focusing on the production and circulation of knowledge, termed as affective epistemologies of antimilima (talking back). This concept reinterprets women's lived and embodied knowledge, emerging at the intersection of academia and social movements, as a form of resistance against established expertise. By drawing on feminist theorists like Donna Haraway and Sara Ahmed, the Element critically examines the relationship between scientific and experiential knowledge. This analysis reconfigures the interplay between rationality and emotion, providing a critique to the binary model of thought and suggesting new avenues for democratic knowledge, society, and citizenship. Historical tracing of these theories offers a counter-narrative to contemporary anti-gender, anti-intellectual, and far-right politics.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT For centuries we have been inundated with images of anti-Black violence. In Scenes of Subjection, Saidiya Hartman demonstrates how such images constitute just one element of the \u2018economy of enjoyment\u2019 upon which transatlantic slavery and its afterlife have been founded. Might Sara Ahmed\u2019s wilful figure of the \u2018feminist killjoy\u2019 offer the blueprint for a form of witnessing that interrupts this economy of enjoyment? In this article, I pursue this possibility through a phenomenologically oriented and auto-ethnographically grounded close reading of the failed comedic relief in the final two episodes of Orange is the New Black\u2019s fourth season. In the wake of a beloved character\u2019s death within a racist carceral system, I feel a growing sense of \u2018unease\u2019 as this slapstick farce falls flat. As Ahmed explains, when sexist and racist jokes are not laughed at, joy is killed in the very failure to extend these bodily and social forms of normativity. Narrating my acute sense of \u2018unease\u2019 as a white consumer who is complicit with extending such images of anti-Black violence, I sketch the \u2018formalist killjoy\u2019 as an interpretive attitude that evidences the always-already ethical brokenness of functioning forms through a general \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 attention.",

      "abstract": "The notion that disorientation is defined by incapability is present in most philosophical accounts to date. Its prevalence may stem from Maurice Merleau-Ponty\u2019s discussion of disorientation as a temporary disturbance of the body-subject\u2019s normal mode of being-toward-the-world in Phenomenology of Perception, but it is also found in most recent feminist descriptions of disorienting experiences brought on by living life under cisheteropatriarchy. In this article, I turn to Mar\u00eda Lugones and Sara Ahmed to make the case for tracing another thread in contemporary understandings of disorientation, one rooted in feminist and queer philosophies. My dynamic view challenges the traditional connection between disorientation and incapability and replaces it with a concept defined by critical liminality, rupture, and creative invention. By weaving together insights from Ahmed and Lugones, I argue we ought to embrace certain dynamic experiences of disorientation as awakening our radical capacities to produce new intentional relations between self and world.",

We are complicit in naturalizing discourses per se whenever we treat a given set of concepts as self-evident or devoid of alternatives \u2013 as something other than a discourse in the Foucauldian sense of being historically contingent and open to change. The notion that there is no discourse devoid of a constitutive outside or exclusion is helpful in drawing our attention, both to the exclusions we ourselves promote, and to the limits of our capacity to recognize this. Due to the latter, naturalization can occur as readily in queer-feminist, anti-racist and other progressively oriented research as in hegemonic discourse. I exemplify this by focusing on the theorization of happiness offered by Sara Ahmed \u2013 herself an important writer on naturalization.",
