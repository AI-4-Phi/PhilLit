      "abstract": "The philosophy of science is a fundamental study of the nature of knowledge, how it is acquired, and its validity and limitations. This study encompasses questions regarding the scientific method, truth, objectivity, and the relationship between theory and reality. In this context, the philosophy of science serves to provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles underlying the scientific process and how knowledge is applied. This article explores various philosophical perspectives on science and examines how different approaches influence the development of scientific knowledge across disciplines.",

      "abstract": "What is philosophy? What can philosophy offer us? What brings us to think philosophically? Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s writings offer fascinating answers to these questions that have largely been overlooked until now. In Schopenhauer and the Nature of Philosophy, Jonathan Head explores the surprisingly rich and compelling metaphilosophy that underlies Schopenhauer\u2019s work and argues that it offers a vital key to unlocking many of the mysteries that surround his ideas. Schopenhauer understands philosophy as grounded in a deep wonder about life and the world that is universal to the human experience, as well as meeting a fundamental need for both explanation and consolation. This account of the nature of philosophy leads to further important discussions concerning the relationship between philosophy and religion, the value of mysticism, and the possibility of social progress. Through examining Schopenhauer\u2019s account of how and why philosophy is done, this book sheds crucial new light on a thinker whose ideas continue to both provoke and inspire.",

My aim is: 1) to dispel a simplified notion of philosophy in bioethics; 2) to unite two strands of philosophy, which converge on important issues relevant to contemporary bioethics; and 3) to explore these strands in terms of enabling, maieutic work on our ethical points of departure.",

PREAMBLE Oakeshott was one of the philosophers Rorty acknowledged in his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature in his effort to rethink the nature of philosophy, following his rejection of traditional epistemology and its associated concept of philosophy as the ground of all disciplines. More than Twenty years before the appearance of Rorty\u2019s Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, Oakeshott had introduced the category of conversation in conceptualizing the nature of philosophy, treating it as one of the many voices in the conversation of mankind. In adopting Oakeshott\u2019s category in making his case for a new concept of philosophy Rorty, like Oakeshott, accentuates the claim of the voice of poetry, without affirming the special privilege of philosophy as moderator of other voices.",

Whereas the history of science is usually signposted clearly in the school science curriculum, the philosophy of science is considered to be embedded in and integral to science education. This article argues that philosophical topics also need to be explicitly signposted and discussed in the teaching of the nature of science in high schools. This study investigates an interdisciplinary course on the nature of science in a Chinese senior high school. The course involved explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics with subject knowledge in each lesson. This mixed method design of the research included a modified version of the Views on Science, Technology and Society questionnaire as reported by Aikenhead and Ryan ( Science Education , 76(5):477\u2011491, 1992 ) and phenomenographical analysis. Although the sample size is small, the results suggest that explicit teaching of philosophy of science topics helps students better understand both the nature of science and the relationship between science, technology and society.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the affinities between film and philosophy by returning to a shared meditation on death and the nature of time. Death has been considered the muse of philosophy and can also be considered the muse of film-philosophy. But what does it mean to say that to film-philosophise is to learn to die, or a kind of training for dying? Film is an artistic object that reminds us of death\u2019s inevitability; it is a meditation on the transient and finite nature of time. Films as diverse as Mizoguchi\u2019s Tales of Ugetsu, Resnais\u2019s Hiroshima mon Amour, and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Nostalgia for the Light take an uncanny approach to the subject, expressing the paradoxical coexistence of life and death and of different temporal dimensions. This article explores the philosophical concept of the death-image and time through a Deleuzian approach to cinema, meditating on the flashback, the coexistence of the present and the past, and the emergence of a new type of Lazarean character\u2009\u2013\u2009one who returns from the dead. The article aims to clarify not simply death\u2019s unquestionable omnipresence in film but also cinema\u2019s role as a contemporary version of the trope of memento mori.",

      "abstract": "This article is devoted to the philosophical study of the conditions under which knowledge can become a component or tool of education. The presentation of the contribution of epistemology to human development and education is based on addressing issues such as the nature of knowledge, sources of knowledge, theories, and criteria of truth. We proceed from the idea that knowledge is a condition of education. Particular attention is paid to the issue of distinguishing between such types of knowledge as 'knowing how\u2019 and \u2018knowing that'. Educational practices open a common foundation that unites the life world of people, types of sociality, and hermeneutical practices. The epistemological approach to the question of the essence of knowledge assumes that knowledge meets three requirements, namely, knowledge must be objective, subjective, and evidentiary. Epistemology includes subjectivity as the basis of human existence in the natural world and the world with others. Intersubjectivity is considered a criterion for the reliability of knowledge about the world, which allows asserting the relationship of the objective with the subjective.",

      "abstract": "Contrasting definitions of organs based either on function or on strictly morphological criteria are the legacy of a tradition starting with Aristotle. This floating characterization of organs in terms of both form and function extends also to organ systems. The first section of this review outlines the notions of organ and body part as defined, explicitly or implicitly, in representative works of nineteenth century\u2019s comparative morphology. The lack of a clear distinction between the two notions led to problems in Owen\u2019s approach to the comparative method (definition of homolog vs. nature of the vertebrate archetype) and to a paradoxical formulation, by Anton Dohrn, of the principle of functional change. Starting from the second half of the twentieth century, with the extensive use of morphological data in phylogenetic analyses, both terms \u2013 organ and body part \u2013 have been often set aside, to leave room for a comparison between variously characterized attributes (character states) of the taxa to be compared. Throughout the last two centuries, there have been also efforts to characterize organs or body parts in terms of the underlying developmental dynamics, both in the context of classical descriptive embryology and according to models suggested by developmental genetics. Functionally defined organ are occasionally co-extensive with morphologically defined body parts, nevertheless a clear distinction between the former and the latter is a necessary prerequisite to a study of their evolution: this issue is discussed here on the example of the evolution of hermaphroditism and gonad structure and function.",

There is continuity between truth and the corresponding objective things, which has always been an absence in\nphilosophy. It is precisely because of this absence that ambiguity occurs when a reasoning process in reality reaches between being and\nnon-being. Thereby leading to the definition for \"philosophy\" has been in an inconclusive dilemma. Philosophy is the reasons summed up\nby human beings in the processes of exploring the laws of nature and gradually cognizing truths. These reasons can involve all knowledge,\naccording to whether they exist in reality to distinguish different domains, which can be divided into three parts: science, metaphysics\nand mathematics. Truth must have absoluteness and immutability, does not exist in reality, and belongs to the category of metaphysics.\nTherefore, in the category of metaphysics, only those contents that have continuity with the corresponding objective things in reality,\nhave the necessary condition for belonging to philosophy. Once in this way to define what are contained in metaphysics, the definition for\n\"philosophy\" will come naturally. In the reality, everything contains two sides that are both opposite and unified. And as \"background\",\nmetaphysics is also indispensable. Otherwise, it is impossible to clearly distinguish the two opposing sides and reach a consensus, thereby\nignoring the continuity that exists between truth and the corresponding objective things. Therefore, the unity of opposites should be a\nternary theory. The three are indispensable, cause and effect to each other, co-birth and co-annihilation.",

Despite worry\u2019s ubiquity, however, it is not altogether clear what exactly worrying is, or why it is we worry. And, surprisingly, there has been no dedicated philosophical account given of the nature of worry specifically, although there is a body of psychological literature concerned with it as well as a recent insurgence of philosophical literature concerned with the nature of anxiety. My aim in this paper, therefore, is to provide such an account. I here provide an account of the nature of worry. On the view I develop, worry is to be understood as a form of affectively motivated cognition. More specifically, I argue that worrying is a cognitive activity constituted by our engagement with forms of practical or epistemic reasoning, supplemented by imaginative engagement and motivated by anxiety. I develop this view primarily by marrying together considerations from the psychological literature on worry and the philosophical literature on anxiety. With this characterization in place, I then go on to make some novel claims about why exactly it is that we worry. The upshot should be an account of worry that addresses the questions of what it is and why we do it.",

The quasi-experimental method was used by employing a pre-test, an intervention, and a post-test which is the same as the pre-test. The intervention involved the presentation of science content from the HPS perspective in six weeks long of discussions. Data were collected through a survey that revealed categorical views regarding the characteristics of the NOS. The results showed that the demonstration of atom theories in the HPS perspective gave a positive effect on the pre-service science teachers in understanding the NOS.",

      "abstract": "Polysemy has recently emerged as a popular topic in philosophy of language. While much existing research focuses on the relatedness among senses, this article introduces a novel perspective that emphasizes the continuity of sense individuation, sense regularity, and sense productivity. This new perspective has only recently gained traction, largely due to advancements in computational linguistics. It also poses a serious challenge to semantic minimalism, so I present three arguments against minimalism from the continuous perspective that touch on the minimal concept, the distinction from homonymy, and the quasi\u2010rule\u2010like nature of polysemy. Last, I provide an account of polysemy that incorporates this continuous perspective.",
