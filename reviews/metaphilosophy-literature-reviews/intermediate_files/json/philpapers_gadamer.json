With Heidegger became conceived as an ontological phenomenon identical to Existenz itself. For Gadamer, hermeneutics criticizes the \u2018pale abstractions\u2019 of Enlightenment conceptions of philosophy for neglecting the work of concepts in philosophy; concepts that have their origins in the self-critical communicative movement of human interpretation",

One sign that his stock is on the rise is the publication of Joel Weinsheimer&#x27;s Gadamer&#x27;s Hermeneutics, a much needed and admirably written introduction to Truth and Method that should push its value even higher.",
