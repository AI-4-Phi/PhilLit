      "abstract": "Sociology of philosophy is the name of a theory-based, empirical sociological subdivision, whose basic approach is praxeological: doing philosophy involves a variety of socially situated practices that in some cases result in philosophical arguments and doctrines fixed in text. Constellation research is an approach developed by the German philosopher Dieter Henrich (1927\u20132022) for investigations into the history of philosophy. It combines a historical and a systematic intent and interest. Constellation research has primarily been tried out on the rapid development of post-Kantian idealism in Germany in the 1790s. The approach has some obvious similarities with different approaches within the sociology of philosophy. The article first gives a condensed presentation of constellation research as a research program. In a second step, it tries to sort out similarities and dissimilarities with key concepts, topics and approaches within the sociology of philosophy. The argument put forward is that constellation research can provide the sociology of philosophy with some novel ideas and that the sociology of philosophy may prove to be a useful resource to constellation research. In short, there is a potential for cross-fertilization between the two approaches.",

Comparisons are made with the philosophical research programme, developed by Dieter Henrich, which goes under the name constellation research. One thing that unites the sociology of philosophy and constellation research is an interest in antagonistic constellations involving rivalry, competition and controversy.

The objective is to reveal how social stress impacts life perspectives through philosophical reflection and social structural analysis, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this influence. The research method primarily relies on literature review and theoretical construction, integrating and analyzing existing philosophical and sociological theories to build a comprehensive theoretical framework. The process begins with a review of the definition of social stress and its manifestations in modern society, followed by an exploration of life perspectives from a philosophical viewpoint and an analysis of how social structures influence individual life perspectives through stress transmission mechanisms. Finally, by contrasting the interpretations of life perspectives from different philosophical schools and sociological theories, the study concludes that modern social stress profoundly alters life perspectives by affecting individuals' cognitive frameworks and value judgments. This conclusion enriches theoretical research in the interdisciplinary field of philosophy and sociology and provides a new theoretical perspective for understanding and addressing mental health issues in modern society.",

      "abstract": "who gets to profit from it are understood as struggles between the dominant sectors of society fought on the terrain of the French state\u2019s bureaucracy (pp. 122\u201328). By comparison, Reed-Danahay\u2019s discussion of the nation-state in Chapters Four and Five is less satisfying. In On the State, Bourdieu (2015) characterizes the state as holding a monopoly on symbolic power. This allows the state to, as Reed-Danahay writes, create a shared \u2018\u2018perception of the world, and . . . way of classifying the social order,\u2019\u2019 a doxic \u2018\u2018common sense\u2019\u2019 that creates shared feelings of belonging, affinity, and rootedness, and, when absent, creates foreignness and marginality (pp. 140\u201342, 166). Linking Bourdieu\u2019s concept of social space to questions of national identify, belonging, and incorporation suggests intriguing opportunities to consider the cognitive aspects of identity and the links between domination, legitimation, and belonging. However, for Bourdieu the state is not only an instrument of doxic submission; the state is also a \u2018\u2018metafield of power\u2019\u2019 whose emergence was tied to the construction of the idea of \u2018\u2018the public\u2019\u2019 (Bourdieu 2015:309\u201311). This second characterization, which is key to understanding the bureaucratic nature of the state and its ability to wield symbolic power, is largely absent from Reed-Danahay\u2019s analysis. Incorporating it would have allowed Reed-Danahay to push her analysis further while also speaking more directly to Bourdieu\u2019s own interest in the state and its role in the broader conceptual framework he was constructing. By collecting so many of Bourdieu\u2019s writings on space in one place and presenting them so transparently, Reed-Danahay has produced a valuable reference work. As such, this book will be of interest to any scholar interested in approaching space from a Bourdieusian perspective or deepening their understanding of Bourdieu more generally, and it would serve as a helpful companion to Bourdieu\u2019s original work for scholars of mobility. For well-prepared scholars, Bourdieu and Social Space presents the reader with many tantalizing suggestions of Bourdieu\u2019s unruly theory-in-the-making and acts as an invitation for fresh theorizing on the intersections of space, place, mobility, and society.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The article examines Bourdieu\u2019s repurposing of Cassirer\u2019s notion of symbolic forms in the context of his sociological paradigm. After outlining the meaning of \u2018symbolic\u2019 in Bourdieu\u2019s work, I reconstruct his understanding of the concept of symbolic form. Bourdieu conceives of symbolic forms both as historically determined cognitive, practical, and evaluative dispositions and as cultural systems (e.g. myth, religion, ideology, art, sciences). I identify two moments in Bourdieu\u2019s appropriation of this notion. In the first moment, which I associate with the idea of a \u201csociology of symbolic forms\u201d and locate in the earlier phase of his reflection, he emphasizes the relation between symbolic forms and social reproduction. In the second one, which I connect with the idea of a \u201cdifferential anthropology of symbolic forms\u201d and locate in the final phase of his production, Bourdieu explores the autonomous perspective of symbolic forms and the universal and trans-historical potential of symbolic forms such as art or science. While his later understanding and use of this notion are arguably more nuanced than his earlier one, I suggest that they still raise specifically philosophical questions that transcend the standpoint of the social and human sciences. In the conclusion, I consider three such issues: the specificity of different symbolic forms; the relation between symbolic forms as historically determined subjective dispositions, on the one hand, and basic human capacities, on the other; the adequacy of the notion of \u2018arbitrary\u2019 to account for symbolic forms.",

      "abstract": "Whereas Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Augustine are probably the best known of the early Western philosophers of religion, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE) also played a particularly consequential role in the development and continuity of Greco-Latin-European social thought. Cicero may be best known for his work on rhetoric and his involvements in the political intrigues of Rome, but Cicero\u2019s comparative examinations of the Greco-Roman philosophies of his day merit much more attention than they have received from contemporary scholars. Cicero\u2019s considerations of philosophy encompass much more than the theological issues considered in this statement, but, in the process of engaging Epicurean and Stoic thought from an Academician (Platonist) perspective, Cicero significantly extends the remarkable insights provided by Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Although especially central to the present analysis, Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods (1972) is only one of several texts that Cicero directs to a comparative (multiparadigmatic and transhistorical) analysis of divine and human knowing. Much of Cicero\u2019s treatment of the philosophy of religion revolves around variants of the Socratic standpoints (i.e., dialectics, theology, moralism) that characterized the philosophies of Cicero\u2019s era (i.e., Stoicism, Epicureanism, Academician dialectics), but Cicero also engages the matters of human knowing and acting in what may be envisioned as more distinctively pragmatist sociological terms. As well, although Cicero\u2019s materials reflect the socio-historical context in which he worked, his detailed analysis of religion represents a valuable source of comparison with present day viewpoints and practices. Likewise, a closer examination of Cicero\u2019s texts indicates that many of the issues of divine and human knowing, with which he explicitly grapples, have maintained an enduring conceptual currency. This paper concludes with a consideration of the relevance of Cicero\u2019s works for a contemporary pragmatist sociological (symbolic interactionist) approach to the more generic study of human knowing and acting.",

Attention is focused on the fact that openness to other scientific subjects is not only a consequence of methodological search, but also a reaction to the crisis of the normative paradigm. Interdisciplinarity is considered as an ontologically justified necessity to understand law not only as a system of norms, but as a complex social, political and linguistic phenomenon.\n\nThe potential of the sociology of law as a tool for identifying the actual operation of norms, analyzing the gap between law and social practice, studying informal regulators and institutional interaction is revealed. The sociological perspective allows us to study law as an element of social order, which does not simply exist in the form of formal norms, but is implemented in the behavior of society members, and in institutional interaction.\n\nIt is noted that political philosophy allows us to critically assess legal reality, comprehend the value principles of normative decisions, and also determine the ideological guidelines that underlie legal regulation. Political philosophy allows us to comprehend how different ideas about freedom, equality, authority and the common good shape different models of the legal system.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the linguistic approach to law, within which law is considered as a linguistic practice that forms and structures legal reality. Taken together, these directions demonstrate the urgency to go beyond normative positivism and expand the research framework of the general theory of law by integrating it into a broader humanitarian context.\n\nKey words: linguistic approach, methodology of law, normativism, law, legal reality, legal understanding, political philosophy, sociology of law.",

      "abstract": "The state treasury has been and remains one of the first concerns of either state rulers or civil servants. Revenues to the treasury are conducted through the taxation of citizens engaged in production and services. Some taxpayers use ways to evade taxes. Illicit trade has been an important segment of tax evasion for people involved in services and trade. The Russian authorities issued legislative acts, in particular, imperial decrees in order to prevent this illegal activity. In the 1790s, trade transactions were determined by customs tariffs and imperial decrees of Catherine II and Paul I. Ports, customs, communication lines, the process of transportation, registrations, sale of goods were regulated. The Russian legal framework encouraged both to the effective work of customs and to the active involvement of the population of border settlements. Financial and monetary rewards remained the main incentive in the fight against illegal, uncustomed import of goods. Citizens (subjects) who were able to detect illegal goods received the entire consignment of goods after paying all duties. Smugglers found guides for unsanctioned crossing the border among the population of border villages, avoiding state restrictions, using means of transport available at the end of the 18th century (animal-powered transport). Customs, which had remained from the time before the Partitions of the Commonwealth, were located on the territory of Kyiv Province. Customs controlled land and river communication lines. Customs and supervisory bodies, namely local police and trade representatives of state city magistrates were involved in anti-illicit trade activities. The documents recorded cases of fictitious payment of duties by merchants who crossed the state border and the customs area of Kyiv Province. The state and personal interest was sufficient for the risks taken by customs officers, residents of border villages and merchants involved in illicit trade.",

      "abstract": "Axel Honneth's Theory of Recognition has engaged first with the sociology of Nancy Fraser and subsequently with new perspectives in social philosophy, aiming to merge the thematic legacy of the Frankfurt School with European and American political thought. Honneth's research has proven to be a decisive tool in reconstructing the theoretical and operational challenges of recent years, as evidenced by various scholars' accounts (Tekin, 2023; Piromalli, 2023). Particularly, given the digital transition in workplaces and the widespread acceleration of technological updates (Rosa, 2016), labor unions and researchers have highlighted that workers' primary concerns today revolve around the loss of freedom and recognition of their contributions, rather than traditional worries about wages or working hours. In this paper, we seek to delve into the connection between the Theory of Recognition and current modes of digitalization, aiming to demonstrate how Honneth's thought can help us understand and define what appears to be a form of digital alienation. Through a theoretical and operational analysis of some productive and social processes, this work aims to elucidate the significance of Honneth's work for contemporary interpretative frameworks of digital transition at both the labor and philosophical levels.\n",

Philosophy of science also provides ethical guidance in research and helps students understand the relationship between law and other disciplines, such as sociology and politics. Through a deeper understanding of philosophy of science, doctoral students in law can compile more comprehensive, relevant, and impactful research, and make significant contributions to the development of legal science in the future.",

A combination of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s theory of habitus together with (neo) Aristotelian virtue ethics philosophy is used to promote a critical form of character education\u2014one that accents the individual as well as the social context through human embodiment. In brief, my intention is that this framework may underpin conceptual and practical possibilities for critical (moral) character development for youth. Obviously the two approaches making up the theoretical framework differ by levels of analysis with predictably less concern for individual moral development from Bourdieu whose focus is on social context (e.g., race, class etc.) as it shows up in patterns of individual perceiving, feeling, thinking, and valuing. The proposed critical character education involves incorporating into processes of virtue and character development a reflexive capacity to understand how community practices, habits, and relations may be unjust or unconducive for human flourishing. The aim is to champion and develop shared qualities of being human while also acknowledging and tackling differences and oppressions in ways that are not counter-productive.",

This is what Hans-Herbert K\u00f6gler tries to do in his contribution to this issue. However, his reasoning remains unclear about the relation between moral philosophy and empirical and historical knowledge about the context of moral action. Furthermore, while he proposes critical-hermeneutic reconstruction as a means to understand the participants in the conflicts, he applies this approach in an asymmetric and insufficiently nuanced way. His view of the conflict as a struggle between democracy and dictatorship about a future world-order is too dichotomic and ignores the history of international law as a practical moral philosophy dealing with situations for which there are no unambiguous principles that could guide action.",

Quality leadership indicators understand the meaning of leadership based on Islamic religious, philosophy, psychology, and sociology perspectives. This study examines educational leadership based on Islamic religious, philosophy, psychology, and sociology perspectives. This study used a library research design by studying references from books and journals related to leadership. In the Islamic religious perspective, educational leadership is a mandate that must be carried out correctly and accounted for by humans and Allah. Leadership that does not work professionally and proportionately is a betrayal of Allah and the Prophet. According to a philosophical perspective, in making decisions, educational leaders must use the right way of thinking to avoid missed decisions that affect school education outcomes. Psychologically a person's leadership style affects the process he lives in everyday life because it is a fundamental human nature from birth to death, so factors from within himself heavily influence his leadership style. Based on a sociological perspective, educational leadership must be able to answer the social challenges of the academic community as the times change.",

Wallace Stevens, who played another significant role in the modernist poetics during a similar period, presented his unique philosophy on reality and phenomena in \u201cNotes Toward a Supreme Fiction.\u201d According to Stevens, humans inevitably need the concept of the \u201csupreme fiction\u201d to grasp reality. This paper aims to examine the roles played by Bradley\u2019s concept of the \u201cfinite center,\u201d which Eliot employed as a poetic or philosophical concept, and Stevens\u2019 concept of the \u201csupreme fiction\u201d in understanding phenomena and reality, and how these conceptions formed the basis of their respective poetic systems. In the process of such comparative analysis, we will explore how closely Eliot\u2019s adoption of Bradley\u2019s \u201cfinite center\u201d aligns with the concept of the \u201csupreme fiction\u201d and examine the significance of these two concepts used by the two poets in terms of the sociology of knowledge.",

      "abstract": "The article analyzes the impact of scientific approaches of historical anthropology as a modern philosophy of history on the theoretical sociology\u2019s understanding of social and cultural dynamics in the planes of \u201clocal civilizations\u201d and global. The methodology of this work includes the principles of complementarity, structure, and dialogue. In the study of the problematic field of labor, the following methods were applied: philosophical hermeneutics, systemic- structural, and interdisciplinary. Historical anthropology as a philosophical- historical discipline, that analyzes the mental- cultural horizon of causality, the essence of historical processes and their possible projection into the future has a significant potential for the understanding of global social- cultural dynamics by theoretical sociology. An important problem for its understanding is the analysis of the essence and trends of globalization and civilizational development. The scientific influence of historical anthropology as a modern philosophy of history on theoretical sociology brings to this social and humanitarian discipline conceptual approaches for researching psychological and worldview- cultural causality and the essence of processes, that are part of its problem field. Among the issues that belong to the intellectual space of theoretical and sociological studies and can be effectively investigated using the concepts of historical anthropology, the following should be noted:\u2013 the study of the mental and cultural horizon of the social dynamics of civilizational communities\u2013 understanding the humanitarian plane of the historical foundations and development trends of \u201clocal civilizations\u201d;\u2013 study of correlation of globalization and civilizational trends of modern socio- cultural dynamics;\u2013 proposing and understanding the scenarios of further global socio- cultural development;\u2013 research of the content and features of alternative models of global socio- cultural dynamics and assessment of the probability of their implementation.Solving these cognitive issues by theoretical sociology using the conceptual approaches of historical anthropology as a modern philosophy of history allows this discipline to form knowledge about the important mental and cultural foundations of causality, essence and probable prospects of sociocultural dynamics both at the level of \u201clocal civilizations\u201d and at the global level. The significance of the analysis of a wide range of psychological and cultural- worldview foundations of socio- cultural processes is explained by the multifaceted and deep nature of their influence on various segments of global social reality, including economic, demographic, scientific- technological, educational, etc.",

      "abstract": "The article is written to commemorate the centenary of the birth of the famous historian of Russian philosophy and sociology Anatoly Andrianovich Galaktionov (1922-2002), whose life activity for a long time was closely connected with St Petersburg (Leningrad) State University. The purpose of the article is a comprehensive understanding of the role of A. A. Galaktionov in the national historical and sociological tradition, as well as a synthesized assessment of his work from the standpoint of the current state of the history of sociology. The historian\u2019s work is revealed within the biographical context and the main stages of the scientist\u2019s life as a struggle for his research principles and beliefs. Based on the historiographical review, the sequence of formation of A. A. Galaktionov\u2019s key scientific ideas is thoroughly considered and the fundamental importance of methodological developments in the field of historical research of the Russian philosophical process is shown. On basis of this approach, his fundamental contribution to the development of Russian science was first concretized. An important conclusion is made that the main creative achievement of A. A. Galaktionov is the concretization and systematization of the historical-materialistic understanding of social thought in Russia. The identification of the national and cultural peculiarities of the Russian philosophical process is indicated as an important moment of this concretization. A vivid example of this kind of concretization was the comprehension of the historical place and significance of Slavophilism in the history of Russian social thought. For the first time in the Russian literature, his characteristic of Russian philosophy as a philosophy of life is highlighted. At the end of the article, the relevance and value of A. A. Galaktionov\u2019s ideas for modern research of Russian philosophical culture and sociological thought is emphasized.",

      "abstract": "The inconsistency of the established attitudes in the analysis of taxation within the framework of the philosophy of taxes and fiscal sociology is reflected in the conflict of teaching these disciplines. One of the ways to resolve the conflict was introducing in the educational environment of the world\u2019s leading universities courses that considered the tax culture of contemporary societies. They allowed formulating new concepts that generalized the results of the symbolic analysis of taxation, complementing the consideration of it as a tool of the state\u2019s fiscal policy. The analysis of this practice formed the basis of the present study. According to the results of the study, a way to overcome the indicated conflict is proposed based on the compatibility of the subject certainty of the philosophy of taxes and fiscal sociology. The authors put forward provisions for the coexistence of different tax systems competing in the taxpayer\u2019s mind for the right to represent the social whole. On this basis, the following conceptual statement concerning taxation is formulated as a special kind of way of constructing social reality, which is diversely analyzed in different university courses. This kind of approach can bring the necessary humanitarian component not only to the teaching of special disciplines but also to the educational environment of a contemporary university in general.",
