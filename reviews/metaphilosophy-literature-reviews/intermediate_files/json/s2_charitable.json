      "abstract": "Abstract:The Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) once said that whoever is capable of performing qurbani (Muslim charitable giving) but does not should not come close to my Eidgah (a place of offering Eid prayers) (Khattab and Khattab 2123). The primary objective of qurbani should be to achieve attainment that is intended to satisfy and get nearer to Allah in the way He likes. Sacrifice in Islam, in a circuitous logic, underlies the act of submission of one's will to Him, the act of spending one's material possessions on the path of the Supreme, an act of true giving. We would begin with the question: Is the moment of infinite giving, the transcendent offering, in a way, self-preserving? This paper shall attempt to understand how the theo-ontological idea of \"sacrifice\" operates in Islamic philosophy and how a deeper understanding of the gesture of qurbani might help us reconfigure the major representational elements surrounding Islamic culture and ethos in the post-9/11 scenario. Taking a cue from Derrida's understanding of ethical \"sacrifice,\" this article shall try to understand how the figural gesture of sacrifice in Islam vis-\u00e0-vis Abrahamic ethics is fundamental to the understanding of qurbani in the post-9/11 xenophobic climate that has reduced the idea to a mere signifier of fundamentalism and cultural monism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The recent revival of Confucianism in the PRC raises questions regarding the legitimacy of cultivating Confucian virtues such as ren (\u4ec1 benevolence), li (\u79ae propriety) and xiao (\u5b5d \u2018filial piety\u2019 or \u2018family reverence\u2019) in an educational context. This article is based on the assumptions that education is an ideologically laden practice and that moral virtues have the potential of functioning to sustain hegemony and other forms of social control. By focusing on the Xiao Jing (\u5b5d\u7d93 Classic of Filial Piety), a lesser known Confucian classic, it offers the Confucian account of filial piety a charitable reading which then proceeds to examine the ideological dimension of filial piety. By employing concepts such as naturalisation and the public\u2013private distinction in my analysis, I argue that filial piety should be understood through a critical lens. While the question \u2018Is filial piety a virtue?\u2019 cannot be answered in a simple, straightforward manner, the discussion on filial piety presented in this article has the potential to shed light on the relationship between politics (understood in a broad sense) and moral education.",

Heidegger's method resembles those of Gadamer and Davidson. But by reading the first Critique as offering two conflicting strands of argument, he abandons their aim of maximizing truth, and his theory of error explains why Kant offers the less-promising strand. Heidegger thus provides a distinctive model of charitable, reconstructive interpretation that avoids hermeneutic ventriloquism\u2014a failure to recognize differences of view between interpreter and text.",

      "abstract": "Nietzsche is one of the most subversive ethical thinkers of the Western canon. This book offers a critical assessment of his ethical thought and its significance for contemporary moral philosophy. It develops a charitable but critical reading of his thought, pushing some claims and arguments as far as seems fruitful while rejecting others. But it also uses Nietzsche in dialogue with, so to contribute to, a range of long-standing issues within normative ethics, metaethics, value theory, practical reason, and moral psychology. The book is divided into three principal parts. Part I examines Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality, arguing that it raises well-motivated challenges to morality\u2019s normative authority and value: his error theory about morality\u2019s categoricity is in a better position than many contemporary versions; and his critique of moral values has bite even against undemanding moral theories, with significant implications not just for rarefied excellent types but also us. Part II turns to moral psychology, attributing to Nietzsche and defending a sentimentalist explanation of action and motivation. Part III considers his non-moral perfectionism, developing models of value and practical normativity that avoid difficulties facing many contemporary accounts and that may therefore be of wider interest. The discussion concludes by considering Nietzsche\u2019s broader significance: as well as calling into question many of moral philosophy\u2019s deepest assumptions, he challenges our usual views of what ethics itself is\u2014and what it, and we, should be doing.",

J\u00fcrgen Habermas has argued against the development of technologies which could make such intervention possible. His argument has received widespread criticism among bioethicists. These critics argue that Habermas's argument relies on implausible assumptions about human nature. Moreover, they challenge Habermas's claim that genetic intervention adds something new to intergenerational relationships pointing out that parents have already strong control over their children through education. In this paper a new approach to Habermas's theory is suggested which makes clear that he has a strong point against genetic intervention. A more charitable reading of Habermas with respect to his assumptions concerning human nature is presented. Moreover, Habermas's assumption concerning the power of genetic controlling is evaluated. By means of a close comparison of genetic and educational control it is shown that Habermas's argument relies on much weaker assumptions than generally understood.",

      "abstract": "Reading is not a peripheral philosophical pastime; it constitutes most of what we do when we do philosophy. And the experience of reading philosophy is much more than just a series of interpretative acts: the philosopher-reader is subject to, among other things, sensations, passions, emendations, and transformations. In this essay, I argue that a full account of philosophical reading should outline some of the sociological structures that determine how different communities of philosophers (within and outside the academy) construct such experiences, as well as describe in detail the ways in which philosophers encounter (or fail to encounter) truths while reading. It should, that is, describe ways in which philosophy acts upon readers and the various effects that result.",

      "abstract": "This study examines how combining Philosophy for Children (P4C) and picture storybooks can reduce English learning anxiety and improve reading comprehension among Indonesian EFL students. Based on Vygotsky\u2019s sociocultural theory and affective pedagogy, the approach addresses both emotional and cognitive aspects of learning. Using a quasi-experimental mixed-methods design, 121 fourth-semester English Department students were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received lessons that used philosophical dialogue and visual storytelling to encourage critical thinking and emotional involvement. Results showed that this approach significantly lowered students' anxiety and improved their reading comprehension and motivation. Qualitative data also revealed that students felt safer and more engaged, which helped them connect personally with the texts. The study shows that student-centered, interdisciplinary teaching can support both language learning and emotional well-being. It offers useful insights for EFL teachers and curriculum developers aiming to create more meaningful and supportive learning environments.",

This judgement, however, depends on a concept of metaphysics that Gadamer overturns with a Pythagorean-Platonic ontology. When this side of his philosophy is developed in tandem with Cheng\u2019s onto-generative hermeneutics, in particular its doctrine of harmonization, new possibilities for self-understanding in relation to the grounds of existence are charted: The event of Being emerges from the reciprocity of rhythm in a dialogue self-similar to the rhythms of nature grasped by Cheng in terms of yin and yang. This consolidates a cross-fertilization between Cheng and Gadamer on the trans-historical foundations of hermeneutics.",

In addition, there is the question of science, as Nietzsche raises this question along with Feyerabend\u2019s programmatic recommendations for traditional philosophy of science. Including a discussion of method in history as in theology and philology, including Nietzsche\u2019s hermeneutics, this essay reviews Feyerabend\u2019s exchanges with Lakatos along with the resistance of mainstream philosophy of science to hermeneutics as such. A discussion of Feyerabend\u2019s \u2018gods\u2019 engages what he invokes as ontological abundance as well as his criticism of the limitations of Popper\u2019s critique of Parmenides requiring both historical/historiographical context, an understanding of science in practice, via a contextualization of Schrodinger, and via Plato\u2019s epistemology along with Duhem on experiment and Riegl on style, crucial for Feyerabend on the notion of \u2018progress,\u2019 key for Lakatos and others, in art and science.",
