      "abstract": "The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Race provides up-to-date explanation and analyses by leading scholars of contemporary issues in philosophy of race and African American philosophy. Ideas about race held by Locke, Hume, Kant, Hegel, and Nietzsche are supplemented by suppressed thought from the African diaspora, early twentieth-century African American perspectives, and Native American, Asian American, and Latin American views. Philosophical analysis is brought to bear on the status of racial divisions as human categories in the biological sciences, as well as within the architectonic of contemporary criticism and conceptual analysis. The special applications of American philosophy and continental philosophy to ideas of race are presented as methodological alternatives to more analytic approaches. As a collection of analyses and assessments of \u201crace\u201d in the real world, there is trenchant and relevant attention paid to historical and contemporary racism and what it means to say that \u201crace\u201d and racial identities are socially constructed. Analyses of contemporary social issues include the importance of racial difference and identity in education, public health, medicine, IQ and other standardized tests, and sports. Societal limitations and structures provided by public policy and law are realistically considered. As a critical theory, the study of race is compared to feminism. Historical and contemporary, as well as academic and popular, racisms pertaining to male and female gender receive special consideration. Although this comprehensive collection may have the effect of a textbook, each of the original essays is a fresh and authentic development of important present thought.",

It has also been playing an increasingly significant role in philosophy: in epistemology, philosophy of science, ethics, social philosophy, philosophy of religion, and elsewhere. This Handbook encapsulates and furthers the influence of philosophy on probability, and of probability on philosophy. Nearly forty articles summarize the state of play and present new insights in various areas of research at the intersection of these two fields. The volume begins with a primer on those parts of probability theory that we believe are most important for philosophers to know, and the rest is divided into seven main sections: history; formalism; alternatives to standard probability theory; interpretations and interpretive issues; probabilistic judgment and its applications; applications of probability: science; and applications of probability: philosophy.",

      "abstract": "The insight gained from Ruth Millikan leads us to investigate animal communication not by considering Gricean communicative intentions, but instead by considering feature of intentional communication, namely the flexible interaction between the participants of the communicative situation. Whether nonhuman primates communicate intentionally, that is, whether they rely on intentions, such as goals and beliefs about goals and knowledge states of the recipient, when they produce signals, has attracted much attention recently in the comparative research on animal communication. Thus, communication can only be successful if all participants attend to each other to get the intended message transmitted correctly. In the situation of two signalers' intentions involved in intentional communication, an individual must be capable of displaying second-order intentionality to display informative intentions, that is, the signaler wants the audience to know about something when producing the signal.",

Both the received canon of Islamic philosophers and the grand narrative of the course of Islamic philosophy are in the process of being radically questioned and revised. The bulk of twentieth-century Western scholarship on Arabic or Islamic philosophy focused on the period from the ninth century to the twelfth. It is a measure of the transformation that is currently underway in the field that the present <italic>Handbook</italic> gives roughly equal weight to every century from the ninth to the twentieth. The <italic>Handbook</italic> differs from previous overviews in another significant way: It is work-centered rather than person- or theme-centered. This format is intended to give readers a better sense of what a work in Islamic philosophy looks like, and of the issues, concepts, and arguments that are at play in works belonging to various periods and subfields within Islamic philosophy.",

There are various ways of understanding this thesis. Along one axis, there is the debate about whether we should focus on the agent\u2019s reliable cognitive skills in general, or whether we should instead treat knowledge as primarily concerned with the manifestation of more elevated epistemic standings, such as intellectual virtues. Along another axis, there is the debate about whether we should understand knowledge as being exclusively defined in terms of the subject\u2019s cognitive skills (where this category includes the intellectual virtues), or whether there need to be supplementary conditions in one\u2019s theory of knowledge to deal with the problem posed by knowledge-undermining epistemic luck. This chapter will explore these topics, and in the process offer an overview of the contemporary debate regarding issues at the nexus of knowledge, skill and virtue epistemology.",

      "abstract": "No period of history has been richer in philosophical discoveries than Germany during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. And while it was the eighteenth century that saw Germany attain maturity in the discipline (above all in the works of Immanuel Kant), it was arguably the nineteenth century that bore the greatest philosophical fruits. This Handbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the philosophy of nineteenth-century Germany that will be helpful to readers of very different sorts, all the way from laymen to undergraduates to experts. The volume is divided into four parts. The first Part explores individual philosophers, including Fichte, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, amongst other great thinkers of the period. The second addresses key philosophical movements: Idealism, Romanticism, Neo-Kantianism, and Existentialism. The essays in the third Part engage with different areas of philosophy that received particular attention at this time, including philosophy of nature and of science, philosophy of mind and language, the philosophy of education, and the relationship between philosophy and science, or Wissenschaft (a German term that is famously less narrowly restricted to natural science and disciplines modeled on it than its English counterpart). Finally, the contributors turn to discuss central philosophical topics, from skepticism to materialism, from dialectics to ideas of historical and cultural Otherness, and from the reception of antiquity to atheism",

Disability raises some of the deepest conceptual and normative issues about human embodiment and well-being; dignity, respect, justice and equality; and personal and social identity. But it also raises pressing practical questions for educational, health, reproductive, and technology policy, and confronts controversial questions about the scope and direction of the human and civil rights movements. The Handbook addresses these issues and more, with contributions from some of the most prominent philosophers in the field. The clarity it brings to these discussions demonstrates fully the continued centrality and importance of philosophical inquiry.",

The topics range from central issues about the nature and variety of love, the possibility of its rational justification, and whether it is an emotion to the significance of love for law, economics, morality, and free will. The volume also contains an introduction to the subject as well as essays on love\u2019s relation to jealousy, religion, knowledge, biotechnology, and several other topics. This wide-ranging handbook will be a key resource for specialists working on the philosophy of love and a helpful guide for those looking to learn more about the area.",

Chapters are grouped into thematic areas and cover a wide range of topics, from key philosophical notions, such as meaning, truth, reference, names and propositions, to characteristics of the most recent research in the field, including logicality of language, vagueness in natural language, value judgments, slurs, deception, proximization in discourse, argumentation theory and linguistic relativity. It also includes chapters that explore selected linguistic theories and their philosophical implications, providing a much-needed interdisciplinary perspective.

This paper explores what relevance extended cognitive processes might have for humility, and especially for the specifically cognitive aspect of humility\u2014viz., intellectual humility. As regards humility in general, it is argued that there are no in principle barriers to extended cognitive processes helping to enable the development and manifestation of this character trait, but that there may be limitations to the extent to which one\u2019s manifestation of humility can be dependent upon these processes, at least insofar as we follow orthodoxy and treat humility as a virtue. As regards the cognitive trait of intellectual humility in particular, the question becomes whether this can itself be an extended cognitive process. It is argued that this wouldn\u2019t be a plausible conception of intellectual humility, at least insofar as we treat intellectual humility (like humility in general) as a virtue.",
