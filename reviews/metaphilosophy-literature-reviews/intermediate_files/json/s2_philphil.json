      "abstract": "Work at the intersection of philosophy and psychiatry has an extensive and influential history, and has received increased attention recently, with the emergence of professional associations and a growing literature. In this paper, we review key advances in work on philosophy and psychiatry, and their related clinical implications. First, in understanding and categorizing mental disorder, both naturalist and normativist considerations are now viewed as important \u2013 psychiatric constructs necessitate a consideration of both facts and values. At a conceptual level, this integrative view encourages moving away from strict scientism to soft naturalism, while in clinical practice this facilitates both evidence\u2010based and values\u2010based mental health care. Second, in considering the nature of psychiatric science, there is now increasing emphasis on a pluralist approach, including ontological, explanatory and value pluralism. Conceptually, a pluralist approach acknowledges the multi\u2010level causal interactions that give rise to psychopathology, while clinically it emphasizes the importance of a broad range of \u201cdifference\u2010makers\u201d, as well as a consideration of \u201clived experience\u201d in both research and practice. Third, in considering a range of questions about the brain\u2010mind, and how both somatic and psychic factors contribute to the development and maintenance of mental disorders, conceptual and empirical work on embodied cognition provides an increasingly valuable approach. Viewing the brain\u2010mind as embodied, embedded and enactive offers a conceptual approach to the mind\u2010body problem that facilitates the clinical integration of advances in both cognitive\u2010affective neuroscience and phenomenological psychopathology.",

Is the future of education and philosophy embracing\u2014or at least taking seriously\u2014and thinking with Indigenous ethicoontoepistemologies? And, perhaps most importantly, what is that \u2018Future\u2019? These debates have been located in the work of diverse scholars: from the West, from Global South, from indigenous thinkers. In this collective piece, we purposefully juxtapose (and do not categorise under forced headings) diverse takes on the future of these intersections. We have given up the urge to organise, place together, separate with subheadings or connect the paragraphs that follow. Instead, we let these philosophers of education and thinkers who use philosophical texts and ideas to sit together in one long read as potentially \u2018strange and unusual bedfellows\u2019. This text urges us to understand how these scholars and thinkers perceive our educational philosophical futures, and how the work and thinking they have done on thinking about what the future of that new key in philosophy of education may look like is embedded in a much deeper and richer literature, and personal experience.",

      "abstract": "The research aims to analyze the principles of implementing education according to the Al-Qur\u2019an. The Al-Qur\u2019an is a source of guidance for Muslims in carrying out their lives, including conducting education. The principles of implementing education are contained in the Al-Qur\u2019an which can be used as a guide for stakeholders and teachers in carrying out their duties. Developing principles for implementing education based on Islamic education philosophy in the Al-Qur\u2019an will produce comprehensive guidance for believers. The research method used in this brief study was a content analysis of the Al-Qur\u2019an to determine the philosophy of educational principles based on the Al-Qur\u2019an. Systematic linguistic analysis in the original Al-Qur\u2019an text and the translation of the Al-Qur\u2019an in English to reveal the principles of educational implementation was carried out. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that there are several principles for implementing education contained in the Al-Qur\u2019an. The first component of the educational principle is reasoning which is promoted in the Al-Qur\u2019an, namely inferential, independent reasoning and facilitated reasoning. The second principle of implementing education is that implementing education is oriented towards developing moral character through various learning process activities or what is called orthopractic theology. The contribution of this research is the discovery of a strong principled basis for implementing education and becoming the basis for hermeneutical research to \ninvestigate the philosophy of implementing education based on the Al-Qur\u2019an that can be applied in real life situations. This research has implications for the practice of implementing education in Indonesia. Teachers must pay attention to the learning methods used that can likely optimize students' reasoning abilities and must accommodate methods of remembering, listening and reading literacy activities.",

This research employed the ethnographic method which utilised the data from figurative peoples in Angkola culture, Angkola\u2019s cultural ceremonies, documents, and related media. The collected data were then reduced and analysed from philosophical, cultural, linguistic, and religious point of views to find the relevance. This research found that Dalihan Na Tolu covers triangle family members for Mora, Kahanggi, and Anak Boru. Dalihan Na Tolu consistently enhances humanity in harmony and it keeps warm in touch with the social profile. Angkola language has unique variations in the structure, coda sound, accent, and intonation to avoid saying subject as respect and the symbol of politeness. Dalihan Na Tolu creates and maintains norms in brotherhood and togetherness as an ingrained belief. The devotion poured in a sense of justice for triangle family members. The taste of brotherhood and togetherness is a fact that only humans have to think about expressing responsibility to unite humanity. The manifestation of Dalihan Na Tolu as a local, national, and perhaps international wisdom has faith, charity, and responsibility as the main point of view for humanity in harmony. The human faith in God has to be perfect with relevance for love, humanity and harmony. Charity humanises people. The responsibility unites humanity. Dalihan Na Tolu reflects many important values to learn from living in the society with particular philosophy, culture, langauge, and religion.Contribution:\u00a0This research describe about roles of philosophy, culture, language, and Islam in Angkola\u2019s local wisdom of \u201cdalihan natolu\u201d in South Tapanuli, Indonesia. This research contributes to providing a comprehensive understanding of how the values in the local wisdom \u201cdalihan natolu\u201d can create social harmonisation.",

Attempts to discredit the activities of the Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences in terms of format and style fit, on the one hand, into the traditions of the well-known \u201cdoctors\u2019 plot\u201d, and on the other hand, into the experience of the latest extreme postmodernism with its most open ec\u00adlecticism and disconnection from external reference. At the same time, there is an implicit attitude towards ideology not as a system of ideas, but as a system of institutions. This allows us to talk about analogies with the practice of raider capture. Philosophy is considered as a self-sufficient and at the same time prac\u00adtically oriented type of intellectual activity. This self-sufficiency brings it closer to art, in which, starting from a certain level of masterpieces and geniuses, gen\u00aderal value hierarchical comparisons are considered not quite correct.",

Although the future of work in a sense is always at stake, the issue is particularly relevant right now, in light of the advent of advanced AI systems and the collective experience of the COVID\u201019 pandemic. This has reinvigorated philosophical discussion and interest in the study of the future of work. The purpose of this survey article is to provide an overview of the emerging philosophical field that engages with the future of work, with a special focus on equality and justice, and to outline a research agenda that can help the field to develop further. Section 2 provides some historical context for the current surge in interest in the topic. Then, we discuss what work is and whether there is a philosophy of work (Section 3). The four main sub\u2010debates we then turn to concern the value of work (Section 4), distributive justice and work (Section 5), productive justice (Section 6), and institutional reforms prompted by changes in how work is organized (Section 7). The final section discusses the importance of the distinction between ideal and non\u2010ideal theory in philosophical investigations into the future of work.",

This paper responds to C&D\u2019s argument, develops an account of the distinction, and applies it to philosophy of language. Section 1 summarizes C&D\u2019s argument against Charles Mills\u2019s version of the distinction. Section 2 develops an account of the distinction that\u2019s inspired by Mills\u2019s work but that differs from what C&D take Mills\u2019s view to be. Section 3 shows that, pace C&D, this distinction picks out interesting subsets of work in philosophy of language. We say that ideal theories adopt models of the social world that fail to recognize systemic oppression and are therefore systematically inaccurate. Nonideal theories correct these inaccuracies.",

These questions are: (i) Are individual and institutional intentions the same kind of thing? (ii) Can the risk of proliferation of systemic functional explanations be managed? (iii) Is there an appealing basis for the apparent methodological individualism in our theories of action and agency? and (iv) Why not, instead, pursue a methodologically anti\u2010individualist and ecological approach to action and agency? The latter alternative, I suggest, offers a promising way to retain many of the core insights of the Bratmanian project while avoiding the difficulties inherent to some of the methodological presumptions of some strands of contemporary philosophy of action.",

The choice of a good philosophical system becomes an unproductive debate but is essential in gaining an understanding of the importance of developing a coherent and comprehensive framework of thought to understand social phenomena. This research is a scientific reflection on the question of the best choice of philosophical systems and the belief in the existence of absolute and relativistic philosophy. This scientific reflection uses a qualitative narrative method in a literature review to answer the research question. Based on the research results, the author sees that a philosophical system has a specificity in contributing to the field of life and science independently. The author also provides a review of answers to the choice of a philosophical system that is suitable for the Doctoral program in Computer Science, namely Information Systems. The answer to the existence of a coherent philosophical system that underlies human wisdom is presented by the author in this paper. This scientific reflection is expected to contribute to the science of knowledge, especially the philosophy of science and the application of research stages in the field of Computer Science. Further research needs to be done to obtain the accuracy of a philosophical system that is suitable for the research topic and other fields of science.",

Thus argues Ben Kies (1917-1979), a South African public intellectual, schoolteacher, trade unionist, and activist-theorist. In his 1953 address to the Teachers\u2019 League of South Africa, The Contribution of the Non-European Peoples to World Civilisation, Kies became one of the first people to argue explicitly that there is no such thing as \u2018Western philosophy\u2019. In this paper, I introduce Kies as a new figure in the historiography of philosophy with important insights, relevant today. I outline his three key arguments: that \u2018Western Philosophy\u2019 is the product of political mythmaking, that it is a recent, largely mid-twentieth century fabrication, and that there is an alternative to \u2018Histories of Western Philosophy\u2019, namely \u2018mixed\u2019 or entangled histories. I show that Kies\u2019 claims are supported both by contemporary scholarship and bibliometric analysis. I thus argue that Kies is right to claim that the idea of a distinctive, hermetically sealed \u2018Western Philosophy\u2019 is a recent, political fabrication and should be abandoned. We should instead develop global, entangled historiography to make sense of philosophy and its history today.",

It is argued that philosophy\u2014love of wisdom\u2014has developed branches over the millennia that reflect the different aspects of thought and action that need to be considered in a comprehensive theory of wisdom. Although there is not a full consensus on what these branches are, the TOP usually has as branches, at minimum, metaphysics\u2014including epistemology and ontology\u2014and ethics, logic, aesthetics, hermeneutics, and axiology. Each of these branches is considered, and its implications for a philosophically based theory of wisdom are considered.

This paper reflects on the roles of philosophy of science in transdisciplinary research while focusing on Indigenous and other subjugated forms of knowledge. We offer a critical assessment of demarcationist approaches in philosophy of science and outline a constructive alternative of transdisciplinary philosophy of science. While a focus on demarcation obscures the complex relations between epistemic communities, transdisciplinary philosophy of science provides resources for meeting epistemic and political challenges of collaborative knowledge production.",

In this paper, we challenge this assumption: we argue that CE is frequently undertaken with the orthogonal aim of conceptual adaptation. We develop this thesis with reference to the interplay between technology and concepts. Emerging technologies can exert significant pressure on conceptual systems and spark \u2018conceptual disruption\u2019. For example, advances in Artificial Intelligence raise the question of whether AIs are agents or mere objects, which can be construed as a CE question regarding the concepts AGENT and OBJECT. We distinguish between three types of conceptual disruption (conceptual gaps, conceptual overlaps, and conceptual misalignments) and argue that when CE occurs to address these disruptions, its primary aim is not to improve concepts, but to retain their functional quality, or to prevent them from degrading. This is the characteristic aim of CE when undertaken in philosophy of technology: to preserve the functional role of a concept or conceptual scheme, rather than improving how a concept fulfills its respective function.",

Bibliometric analysis was carried out through mapping visualization using VOSviewer. The research method is Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Bibliometric analysis mapping has 4 stages: data search, data processing, data mapping, and data analysis. The keywords used are \"Philosophy of Science\" AND \"Technology\" with a range of 2018 - 2022. The number of articles obtained was 184 articles. The number of articles used for the literature review is 10 articles. The results show that research development has decreased from 2018 to 2020 and has increased from 2020 to 2022. Philosophy of science in the field of science and technology has many opportunities in various fields and studies within the scope of science and technology. Issues related to the philosophy of science are still quite widespread, especially for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students, due to the lack of confidence in STEM students in the philosophy of science. The link strength value of the connection between philosophy and science is stronger when compared to the connection between philosophy and technology. This means that more researchers are linking philosophical research to science than technology. This research is expected to be a consideration in determining the research theme to be carried out, especially those related to the field of philosophy of science.",

This Element examines the role played by OS principles and practices within contemporary research and how this relates to the epistemology of science. After reviewing some of the concerns that have prompted calls for more openness, it highlights how the interpretation of openness as the sharing of resources, so often encountered in OS initiatives and policies, may have the unwanted effect of constraining epistemic diversity and worsening epistemic injustice, resulting in unreliable and unethical scientific knowledge. By contrast, this Element proposes to frame openness as the effort to establish judicious connections among systems of practice, predicated on a process-oriented view of research as a tool for effective and responsible agency.

This article also highlights the nuanced interplay between research paradigms and theoretical perspectives, demonstrating the rich, diverse potential of business research inquiries.Research limitations/implicationsWhile this article provides a broad overview of the interplay between research paradigms and emerging trends, future research could explore each of these interplays in greater detail, conducting empirical studies or utilizing specific case studies.Practical implicationsResearchers and practitioners should be open to adopting, combining or switching between different paradigms according to the demands of their research questions, context and trends shaping the business landscape, thereby underscoring the need for methodological flexibility and reflexivity in business research.Social implicationsThe shift toward embracing digital transformations and integrating sustainability in business research holds significant implications, driving socially responsible and sustainable business practices at the micro-level, and by extension, industrial revolution and sustainable development at the macro-level.Originality/valueThis article offers a holistic and contextualized view of the philosophy of science and research paradigms for business research, bridging the gap between philosophical foundations and contemporary research trends.",

China\u2019s environmental crime legislation has gone through the exploration period, establishment period, and optimization period. The environmental philosophy behind this is worth discussing and determines the direction China will take environmental crime in the future and whether China\u2019s environmental strategy can really be implemented. At present, the disputes about the environmental philosophy of environmental crime in China are mainly reflected in the contention between anthropocentrism, ecocentrism, and eco-anthropocentrism. There are radical risks of pure human centrism or pure ecological centrism, and these two theories struggle to serve as a value basis for environmental crime legislation. Although eco-anthropocentrism seems to be comprehensive, it is actually ambiguous, and it is still difficult to deal with the conflict between people and nature. In recent years, China has continuously emphasized the construction of ecological civilization construction and written this into the constitution. Therefore, in the environmental philosophy issues of environmental crimes in China, we should consider absorbing the advantages of anthropocentrism, ecocentrism, and eco-anthropocentrism, while taking the original Chinese ecological civilization philosophy as the value foundation.",

      "abstract": "Unsupervised learning algorithms are widely used for many important statistical tasks with numerous applications in science and industry. Yet despite their prevalence, they have attracted remarkably little philosophical scrutiny to date. This stands in stark contrast to supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms, which have been widely studied and critically evaluated, often with an emphasis on ethical concerns. In this article, I analyze three canonical unsupervised learning problems: clustering, abstraction, and generative modeling. I argue that these methods raise unique epistemological and ontological questions, providing data-driven tools for discovering natural kinds and distinguishing essence from contingency. This analysis goes some way toward filling the lacuna in contemporary philosophical discourse on unsupervised learning, as well as bringing conceptual unity to a heterogeneous field more often described by what it is not (i.e., supervised or reinforcement learning) than by what it is . I submit that unsupervised learning is not just a legitimate subject of philosophical inquiry but perhaps the most fundamental branch of all AI. However, an uncritical overreliance on unsupervised methods poses major epistemic and ethical risks. I conclude by advocating for a pragmatic, error-statistical approach that embraces the opportunities and mitigates the challenges posed by this powerful class of algorithms.",

It charts the shift from inclusive histories of philosophy, which included non-European philosophies, to exclusive histories of philosophy, which excluded and/or marginalized non-European philosophies, at the end of the 18th century. This shift was motivated by racial Eurocen-trism, which cast a long shadow over histories of philosophy written during the 19th and 20th centuries. The paper also considers recent attempts to produce a more inclusive history of philosophy. By examining the history of the inclusion and exclusion of non-European philosophies in histories of philosophy, this paper seeks to challenge the assumption that philosophy began and has been practised exclusively by European or western thinkers",
