      "abstract": "Many today agree that philosophy, as an academic discipline, must, for the sake of its very survival, become more inclusive of a wider range of perspectives, coming from a more diverse pool of philosophers. Yet there has been little serious reflection on how our very idea of what philosophy is might be preventing this change from taking place. In this essay I would like to consider the ways in which our ideas about philosophy\\u27s relation to tradition, and its relation to other dimensions of human culture, influence efforts to promote greater diversity in the field",

      "abstract": "In this paper I propose a future direction for comparative philosophy on which it enters the space of public philosophy by capitalizing on the fact that it is already cross-cultural, and adding multi-disciplinary research to its proper foundation. This is not a new thesis. Rather, it is an ideological articulation of thought that is already underway in what is sometimes called fusion philosophy, as found in the work of Evan Thompson, Jay Garfield, or Christian Coseru.  My articulation begins with a non-exhaustive delineation of distinct types of public-philosophy that are already well known in the public space. One core distinction I draw concerns how the very notion of \u2018public philosophy\u2019 can be understood. I distinguish between the philosophy-to-public direction of fit, on which philosophers enter the public space for some public benefit, and the public-to-philosophy direction of fit, on which the public plays a constructive role in guiding philosophers in some important epistemic manner. Because my position engages the issue of whether \u201cphilosophy\u201d can truly be found outside of the west, I offer an account of the relation between science, religion, and philosophy with respect to inquiry into the human condition. In doing so I offer an argument against the view that philosophy can only be found in the west based on the difference between a term in a language and what the term picks out. I close with a discussion of how analytic philosophy, comparative philosophy, and experimental philosophy can come together to form one kind of bidirectional public philosophy",

Yet Art History classes can teach valuable skills. When taught in a broad context, the objects art history studies engage critical thinking and can generate new forms of knowledge. However, the pedagogical structure and content of introductory art history survey course does not always offer students the creative leeway to make these connections. Instructors at the college level often retreat to the methods and content that have been a part of the discipline since its inception in the late 19thcentury; the professor as expert authority on the western canon of objects and the grand narrative of progressive development that accompanies them. As university students are becoming more ethnically and socially diverse, the objects covered in the survey continue to speak to a white, European audience that is no longer the only audience listening. While art history remains useful, its canon of objects has become problematic, and reinforces the othering of the non- western world.\nThis essay will first examine how the modern canon and art history\u2019s pedagogical practices came to be by examining the history of the discipline, and the theories, methods and texts that developed alongside academic art history. It will then take a brief look at how modern philosophy, primarily the conceptual ideas of Deleuze and Guattari, can provide a new framework for examining how the teaching of art history can be globalized and taught in a more meaningful way",

      "abstract": "Abstraction, as an art movement, represents the largest modernisation of visual arts since the Renaissance, reconfiguring how we perceive information on a global scale (Frankel 2012). In shedding representational form and meaning, abstraction presents an evocative sensuality that transcends language and culture. This sensuality provides a strong foothold in commercial visual communications, which has persisted over time. While modern perceptions of the genre demarcate between \u2018artistic\u2019 and \u2018commercial\u2019 forms of abstraction, the formative period of the genre saw little distinction between art and consumer cultures. Artists such as Len Lye articulate the commercial versatility of abstract animation. Works such as Colour Flight (1956) and Rainbow Dance (1936) exist simultaneously as advertising and art. Fast-forwarding to our modern media experience, abstract animation has faded from the public eye. It has become both an obscure art form and a commercial cipher. Is it possible to bring this vital art form into a more prominent position? In order to address this question, this paper adopts Inclusive Design as a paradigm in order to develop a case for the modern presentation and creation of abstract animation. It considers the disappearance of abstraction as a design problem \u2013 which implies that a solution may be considered",

On the Genealogy of Universals seeks to overcome our sense of over-familiarity with these concepts by providing a case study of their evolution during the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, a study that shows how the history of these concepts is bound up with the origins and development of analytic philosophy itself. Understanding how these concepts were taken up, transfigured, and given up by the early analytic philosophers, enables us to recover and reanimate the debate amongst them that otherwise remains Delphic. This book begins from the early, originating texts of analytic philosophy that have hitherto baffled commentators, including Moore's early papers, and engages afresh with the neglected contributions of philosophical figures that historians of analytic philosophy have mostly since forgotten, including Stout and Whitehead. This sheds new light upon the relationships of Moore to Russell, Russell to Wittgenstein, and Wittgenstein to Ramsey",

      "abstract": "Received 22 February 2018. Accepted 29 March 2018. Published online 3 April 2018.A serious concern faced by many scholars and readers of philosophy is how to proceed after reading the canonical texts; this may include the question \u2013 \u201cwhy are they canons, anyway?\u201d Of course, developing a passing knowledge of the works of mainstream philosophers remains an inevitable burden for students of philosophy. However, any specific written work is a product of particular vantage points and contexts, and thus cannot escape from showing partiality towards some perspectives. This work revisits the taken-for-granted assumptions involved in the selection of canonical texts and argues for a critical readership and re-imagination of their canonical status and pre-eminence. The necessity of a de-canonized reading of canonical texts is asserted; that is, a repositioning of these texts vis-\u00e0-vis the wide availability of non-canonical philosophical works, which permits a nuanced account of their reading and interpretation. Here, the goal is to examine the potential of an approach that prompts readers of philosophical texts to navigate the richness of different contexts and perspectives without being dependent on the Western agenda as the central frame of inquiry. It is hoped that this mode of rethinking may, at the very least, promote epistemic modesty",

A dramatic upsurge in botanical metaphors for poetic collections around 1800 was triggered by shifts in the geographies, aims, and representational practices of botany in the previous century. Yoking Linnaean taxonomy and Buffonian vitalism to Hogarth\u2019s line of beauty, late eighteenth-century botanical illustrations imbued plucked, pressed specimens with a new vitality. Erasmus Darwin\u2019s Botanic Garden (1789, 1791) translated the aesthetic reanimations of visual art into a collection of poetic specimens, spurring compilations that promote a vitalist standard of literary value. By rejecting aesthetic reanimation as the figurative ground for poetic collecting, Charlotte Smith and Robert Southey forward an alternative historical model of literary merit, one grounded in the succession and continuity of representative literary types. These competing metrics for selection and valuation underwrite the anthology as we know it today",

The first, explored with the discussion of Ubi Caritas and the (2010) String Quartet, concerns the interpretation of harmony; that is harmony, plainly being the vertical component in music but having an inbuilt propensity for horizontal movement, including line and counterpoint. In echoes of Poems & Prose, there is a disregard for any horizontal reasoning, harmony is constrained to the point of isolation and focus fundamentally shifts to the chord as 'object'. I consider this 'objective' sense in detail, in subsequent music in this portfolio.\n\n\n\nA second theme hinges on a discussion of 'musical material' (the term devised by Theodor Adorno); this considered alongside Samuel Beckett's description of a relationship, between 'mess and confusion' (Beckett's terms for material) and the 'form' that contains it. In Echoes of Poems & Prose, I consider material explicitly, in particular the singular sound. With Fountains and Stato di Cambiamento control of the sounds and their overall architecture become increasingly obscure, with issues around form, substantively re-defining the compositional process.\n\n\n\nA third theme is the consideration of aspects of structure, which become of particular significance in the final pieces Triptych and Divergenza (the term 'structure' being as defined by John Cage). In Triptych, exploration is made of a confining form into which structural material grows; material that yields intensely colourful musical moments. In the final piece Divergenza, the Fibonacci sequence applies a vice-like grip on the material, but as I remove the conceptual dependence on this sequence, the music's intrinsic characteristics of rhythm and character grow to become of central importance",

      "abstract": "This paper attends to the politics and pedagogy of canon formation by looking at the ways in which a century of Anglo-American historiography since the formal consolidation of the discipline in the 1870s has constructed images of geography's history during the \u2018long\u2019 eighteenth century (c.1660\u20131832). It is contended that different images of geography in that era have been constructed to suit various imaginings of the nature of geography from Keltie's imperialist image at the start of the twentieth century through to David Livingstone's reworking of geography as an Enlightened science. As such, whilst a stable \u2018canon\u2019 of geographers such as Cook, Kant and Humboldt has been built, how the individuals who constitute it and their achievements are framed has mutated over time. The essay concludes by reflecting on what we can learn from this survey about how geography builds canons, the strengths and weaknesses of the discipline's canon formation and its role in promoting humane inquiry",

      "abstract": "This essay considers Jacques Lecoq's influence almost 20 years after his death. Arguing that Lecoq's pedagogy is largely as relevant today as it was when he was still alive, the author speculates whether Lecoq would have welcomed developments in the use of digital technology within live performance. The essay proposes that much of Lecoq's teaching with its emphasis on play, complicite, invention, imagination and the creative actor remains relevant to contemporary developments in site-specific, immersive and postdramatic theatre. The essay is constructed in the form of a posthumous letter to Jacques Lecoq",
