I worry that their approach encourages two scholarly sins. First, anachronistic historiography in which we distort Smith\u2019s ideas by making him answer questions about contemporary debates in CSR theory. Second, treating him as a prophet by assuming that finding out what Smith would have thought about it is the right way to answer such questions. MATTHIAS H\u00dcHN AND Claus Dierksmeier make extensive and effective use of scholarship in the history of ideas to refute the greed is good caricature of Adam Smith that has become received wisdom among business ethicists. This is a valuable negative service since the persistent misrepresentation of Smith by our discipline is not only a collective failure of scholarship, but has also legitimated a distorted view of the role of ethics in a market economy. However, I am not persuaded of what the authors claim is their positive contribution: that a better understanding of \u2018the real A. Smith\u2019 leads to better normative business ethics research and education. University of Tilburg.

      "abstract": "\n \n While the literature on Islamic Green Ethics (\n GE\n ) has burgeoned, its discourses often remain constrained, either by mirroring global environmental narratives or by uncritically repeating doctrinal postulates. This editorial argues for a more robust and historically grounded approach, proposing a methodology of \u201creassembling creation\u201d through a systematic engagement with the full spectrum of the Islamic tradition. It introduces a tripartite typology, distinguishing between scholarly disciplines, sub-disciplines, and specialised genres, as an analytical framework to map this vast intellectual landscape. This framework facilitates engaging with a diverse array of sources, including jurisprudence\n (fiqh)\n , theology (\n kal\u0101m\n ), philosophy\n (falsafa)\n , Sufism (\n ta\u1e63awwuf\n ), and practical genres like Prophetic medicine (\n \u1e6dibb al-nabaw\u012b\n ) and public supervision (\n \u1e25isba\n ).\n \n The articles included in this thematic issue serve as case studies that embody this interdisciplinary and critical method. The contributions derive principles from the Qur\u02be\u0101n and Sunna, analyse classical philosophical traditions, and construct contemporary ethical frameworks from both Sunn\u012b and Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b perspectives. Ultimately, this editorial and the accompanying articles aim to stimulate a more comprehensive and critically engaged discourse, demonstrating the Islamic tradition\u2019s rich potential to address contemporary ecological challenges.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancements in quantum technology, spanning computing, communication, and sense, necessitate a robust ethical governance framework to address emerging societal and geopolitical challenges and generate socially desirable outcomes. This study investigates the discourse on quantum ethics by comparing perspectives from Western and Chinese scholars. We conduct a comparative analysis of scholarly publications across two cultures to explore the perceived significance of quantum ethics, the preferred ethical approaches, and the core values that are shaping this emerging field. Western scholars largely emphasize regulatory measures, collective responsibility, and macro-ethical considerations, whereas Chinese scholars integrate philosophical perspectives, micro-ethical concerns, and national governance strategies. While both contexts recognize privacy, security, and responsible innovation as critical ethical principles, their interpretations diverge based on cultural and geopolitical influences. This research contributes to the formation of a globally informed ethical framework for quantum technology, facilitating cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration in the responsible development of quantum advancements.",

      "abstract": "This essay provides a critical analysis of Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s perspectives on the aims and purposes of scholarly composition as articulated in the Muqaddimah. For Ibn Khald\u016bn, writing transcended mere technical execution; it represented the highest form of scholarly communication, preserving knowledge across generations and ensuring that science and learning benefit those \u201cwho are absent and live at a later time.\u201d Accordingly, he delineated seven legitimate aims of composition, from the creation of new sciences to the judicious abridgment of extensive works. These aims, he contended, protect scholarship from distortion, plagiarism, and superficial repetition, while affirming its status as a trust (am\u0101nah) to be fulfilled with integrity in the service of truth and future generations. This essay contextualises these reflections within the intellectual milieu of the fourteenth century, characterised by the proliferation of commentaries and indiscriminate abridgments. It demonstrates how Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s critique addressed the risks of stagnation in scholarship and highlights the continued relevance of his insights to contemporary academic discourse, including the pressures of \u201cpublish or perish\u201d and issues of academic integrity. In this way, the essay affirms Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s enduring contribution to authentic scholarship and to an ethical conception of authorship, which remains essential to both the Islamic intellectual tradition and the broader endeavour of civilisation-building.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have received significant attention since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. People are experimenting with AI technologies in different aspects of daily life, including the use of AI tools in the scholarly writing process. Researchers and journal publishers are debating the impact of AI technologies on the quality and accountability of scholarly works. Indeed, scholarly journals play an important role in the dissemination of research and should be advising authors on the appropriate and acceptable use of AI technologies in scholarly publishing. Yet very few studies have examined how journals are providing AI-related guidance to authors.\nThis work-in-progress (WIP) research explores how scholarly journals advise authors about the use of AI in the scholarly writing process by conducting a content analysis of journal policies. Specifically, the study sample was comprised of the top 20 journals, identified using journal metrics provided by Google Scholar in the following subject areas: STEM, humanities, literature & arts, social sciences, and library and information sciences. Policies from these 80 journals were collected from publicly available websites and then examined in August 2024 to assess how journals are currently providing AI-related guidance to authors. The guiding research questions and content analysis focused on the following aspects: 1) The presence or absence of AI in the journal policy; 2) Definition / examples of AI; 3) Guidance on the use of AI for authors; 4) Guidelines about AI for peer reviewers. In this WIP poster, preliminary findings from the content analysis are presented.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we discuss ethical issues related to using and disclosing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and other systems based on large language models (LLMs), to write or edit scholarly manuscripts. Some journals, such as Science, have banned the use of LLMs because of the ethical problems they raise concerning responsible authorship. We argue that this is not a reasonable response to the moral conundrums created by the use of LLMs because bans are unenforceable and would encourage undisclosed use of LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs can be useful in writing, reviewing and editing text, and promote equity in science. Others have argued that LLMs should be mentioned in the acknowledgments since they do not meet all the authorship criteria. We argue that naming LLMs as authors or mentioning them in the acknowledgments are both inappropriate forms of recognition because LLMs do not have free will and therefore cannot be held morally or legally responsible for what they do. Tools in general, and software in particular, are usually cited in-text, followed by being mentioned in the references. We provide suggestions to improve APA Style for referencing ChatGPT to specifically indicate the contributor who used LLMs (because interactions are stored on personal user accounts), the used version and model (because the same version could use different language models and generate dissimilar responses, e.g., ChatGPT May 12 Version GPT3.5 or GPT4), and the time of usage (because LLMs evolve fast and generate dissimilar responses over time). We recommend that researchers who use LLMs: (1) disclose their use in the introduction or methods section to transparently describe details such as used prompts and note which parts of the text are affected, (2) use in-text citations and references (to recognize their used applications and improve findability and indexing), and (3) record and submit their relevant interactions with LLMs as supplementary material or appendices.",

      "abstract": "In today\u2019s \u2018publish or perish\u2019 academic setting, the institutional prizing of quantity over quality has given rise to and perpetuated the dilemma of predatory publishing. Upon a close examination, however, the definition of \u2018predatory\u2019 itself becomes slippery, evading neat boxes or lists which might seek to easily define and guard against it. This volume serves to foreground a nuanced representation of this multifaceted issue. In such a rapidly evolving landscape, this book becomes a field guide to its historical, political, and economic aspects, presenting thoughtful interviews, legal analysis and original research. Case studies from both European-American and non-European-American stakeholders emphasize the worldwide nature of the challenge faced by researchers of all levels.\n This coauthored book is structured into both textual and supplemental materials. Key takeaways, discussion questions, and complete classroom activities accompanying each chapter provide opportunities for engagement and real-world applications of these concepts. \n Crucially relevant to early career researchers and the senior faculty, library scholars, and administrators who mentor and support them, 'The Predatory Paradox: Ethics, Politics, and Practices in Contemporary Scholarly Publishing' offers practical recommendations for navigating the complex and often contradictory advice currently available. University instructors and teaching faculty will also find the reading essential in order to properly prepare both graduate and undergraduate students for the potential pitfalls endemic to scholarly publishing.",

      "abstract": "\n Debates about the role of international relations (IR) scholarship in contemporary politics historically privilege \u201cpolicy relevance\u201d as both a goal and site of debate. The role of scholarship, scholars, and scholarly collectives has become increasingly resonant given the overlapping crises of white supremacy, police violence, and state repression in the United States, the worldwide pandemic, and the antidemocratic nationalist politics throughout Europe and the United States. Critical IR and critical security studies typically resist policy engagement entirely, positioning critical thought and inquiry as political intervention in and of itself. Here, I explore that claim using quantum concepts that foreground the inextricability of entanglement in thinking politics, ethics, and action. Ultimately, I argue that IR should move toward engaging and being responsible to the/a political present. Drawing on the temporality in IR literature, I argue that we are always already entangled with a heterotemporal present. Framing the question of political relevance as a binary of for/against precludes an effective assessment of the politics and normative meaning of scholarly interventions into contemporary politics. By reformulating our understanding of scholarship as produced by and reproducing a political present, something with which we are inevitably entangled whether we choose to be or not, the question of relevance becomes reoriented toward scholarly relationships with a/many presents, and consequently, a/many pasts and futures. Negotiating this dynamic is a more complex question than the narrow formulation of policy and/or political recommendations, and requires a fundamental rethinking of the presumption that scholarship in and of itself is sufficient.",

The research draws on a textual analysis of Ibn Khaldun\u2019s Muqaddimah and other early Muslim works regarding the craft of writing while addressing the broader, wider context of writing ethicality and its influence on social consciousness. This study discusses the worldview and ethics of writing, concepts, and terminologies, sources and objectives, investigation, and styles of presentation according. This research demonstrates that Ibn Khaldun\u2019s writing methodology and style continue to stand as a prime example for scholarship in the social sciences and that his spiritual beliefs and value system served to further enhance the originality and rigor of his writing and conceptual schemes. Further inductive research conducted across a larger body of Muslim literature will bring about interesting insights on the relationship between spirituality and research writing, as well as the historical contribution of Muslim authors to the advancement of universal knowledge.",

However, which points or criteria are important in interpreting these events are often less than clear. Given the significant societal changing events of the past year that challenge human dignity and values (e.g., pandemic, storming of US Capitol, Black Lives Matter), Human Resource Development (HRD) or cognate field scholars have a responsibility to study these phenomena in ways that uphold the ethics and standards of academic research (Russ-Eft, 2018; Werner, 2016). Whether a concept study or probabilistic analysis, journal articles are academia\u2019s venue, which serve as historical markers to further shape the identity of the discipline. A recent peer-reviewed paper regarding a World War II incident has become a wake-up call that challenges the academic integrity of peer-reviewed articles and journals. In response to this situation, we examine the relevance of this case to AHRD Standards on Ethics and illuminate how research integrity, ethics, and rigor are important and helpful for interpreting a major or series of world event.",

Considering the relevance of this problem, the authors of this paper initiated a study devoted to a narrative review of scientific sources of foreign authors from far and near abroad on teaching professional ethics to future teachers, synthesizing points of view on key aspects of this problem. The research was carried out by the method of systematization and generalization of pedagogical experience in the aspect of the issue under study, thus the authors of this work tried to bring experimental facts of scientific views of authors from far and near abroad into the system of observation. According to the results of interviews with graduate students, the majority of respondents have low indicators of knowledge and skills in the field of professional ethics by the end of university, which will have a negative impact on their future professional activities. The results of research will expand scientific knowledge on the problem of forming professional ethics among students-future teachers and complement the main provisions of professional ethics and concepts of moral and professional development of the individual, enriching the theory and methodology of continuing professional education.",
