      "abstract": "This article argues for analytics of dietary habits of Mahatma Gandhi through an argument around his practices and manner of articulation on discourses on food; his experimentation around dietetics and its relation to political goals in the light of colonial governmentality. Gandhi's dietetics practice intervened with the construction of Oriental as the 'others', showing that the subject (Indian) domain constituted the hegemonic order of colonial reign by presenting the superiority inherent in the colonial culture. In this regard, this article describes the emergence of Gandhi's alternative dietary habits, with analyses of discourses on scientific treatment of food as a part of daily livelihood, while understanding and arguing for the importance of dietetics as an integral part of the political world of modernity. It concludes that the broader contours of Gandhian philosophy and its introduction in Indian society through nationalist politics are uniformly appended with the formulation of his experimentation, not only with his philosophical and political goals but also with his daily practices dietetics constitute an essential part. Throughout, there is an attempt to present the symbolic and discursive construction of dietetics and experimentations to negotiate the individual's character.",

      "abstract": "In this article, we reflect critically on how moral actions are categorised in some recent studies on moral spillovers. Based on classic concepts from moral philosophy, we present a framework to categorise moral actions. We argue that with a finer classification of moral values, associated behaviour is better understood, and this understanding helps to identify the conditions under which moral licensing takes place. We illustrate our argument with examples from the literature on pro-environmental behaviours. Moral spillovers are frequently studied in this behavioural domain and to understand what causes their occurrence is highly (policy) relevant if we wish to promote sustainable behaviour.",

It opens with a survey of foundational philosophical theories of causation, focusing on the tension between metaphysical accounts and judgment-based approaches. The discussion then turns to a range of linguistic phenomena\u2014including causative constructions, conditional sentences, discourse coherence, aspectual interpretation, and argument structure\u2014demonstrating how causal relations are systematically encoded across grammatical domains. Building on insights from linguistics, philosophy, and cognitive science, the article reviews recent developments of a semantic framework for modeling causal knowledge in language. Rather than assuming a uniform mapping between causal relations and their linguistic expressions, the framework accounts for systematic variation in how causality is selected, structured, and communicated. In doing so, it positions natural language as a key source of evidence for understanding the architecture of causal reasoning and its representation in human cognition.",

By enabling systematic mapping of the diversity of moral registers within which social policy concerns might legitimately be considered, we contend that value pluralist-inspired analysis can aid constructive policy dialogue. Our argument is founded on four claims: first, as a matter of normative principle, value pluralism represents a defensible ethical standpoint; second, as a matter of fact, people are attracted to a plurality of moral values; third, as a matter of democratic legitimacy, pluralism offers a means of (partially) reconciling rival moral claims; fourth, as a matter of political strategy, pluralism offers a pragmatic approach that can engage protagonists on their own terms. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this pluralist approach to the vexed question of welfare conditionality, which we interrogate via six normative perspectives (rights, utilitarianism, contractualism, communitarianism, paternalism and social justice).",

The present article wish to develop the audio paper format as a reflective movement in which philosophical, aesthetic and practical attributes are considered.As suggested in Groth & Samson, 2016, the audio paper is an aesthetic academic practice working with auditory, aesthetic and affective production of sensation and knowing. Following Deleuze\u2019s depiction of affects as \u201cblocs of sensations\u201d (Deleuze 1994: 123), the audio paper is here suggested as an experimental encounter between the \u2018blocs of sensations\u2019 in art with a propositional mapping of concepts found in philosophy and science. In the present article we wish to develop an argument from our audio paper manifesto, that \u201cthe aesthetic, material aspects of the audio paper produce affects and sensations.\u201d (Groth & Samson 2016). Such production of affective distributions of the sensible enables the producer and the listener to participate in an affective attunement. Following Massumi and Manning\u2019s adaption of Sterne\u2019s notion of \u2018relational attunement\u2019 as emergent or affective attunement (Manning & Massumi, 2014: 217), we here find a knowledge practice that allows an attunement that opens up linear knowledge towards a singular event. Such affective composition allows for heterogeneous sensations to co-exist in which the thinker, producer and listener are folded together in the temporal materiality of sound. As such, the audio paper is a practical and relational encounter between bodies (thinking, audio production, listening) and their mutual capacity to affect and to be affected (See also Deleuze 1988). It is an encounter that among others relates to the materiality of sound, the intensity and polyrhythms in dramaturgy or the enactments of environmental sounds (see Groth & Samson 2016). Affects are not divisible in themselves, but consist as affective tonalities that opens up towards timely affective attunements in A: the process of production in which the academic producer engages with the sound material and its aesthetics, and in B: in the attunements of the listener.Through such affective attunements, the article suggests that the audio paper gives rise to thinking, producing and listening through temporality and sonic material.

      "abstract": "Islamic law, as a science, is deeply rooted in rational perception and practical reason, giving it a philosophical structure distinct from modern law. This distinction lies particularly in its metaphysical conception of reason, which ties Islamic law to theology in a metaphysical sense. Unlike modern law, which often reduces legal obligations to political or theological domains, Islamic law bases its framework on a reasoned understanding of \u201cdos and don\u2019ts.\u201d These imperatives are derived from necessity, defined through factual subsistence (thub\u016bt nafs al-amr\u012b) and veritable propositions (qa\u1e0d\u0101y\u0101 \u1e25aq\u012bqiyya), rather than simple factual statements (\u201cis and isn\u2019t\u201d). Consequently, Islamic law is considered a realistic science, with its realism stemming from subsistence rather than topical or external determinations. This non-deterministic realism sets it apart from contemporary legal systems, underscoring a fundamental difference in their philosophical foundations.",

Several didactically applicable methods have evolved in digital culture, including their implicit methodologies, theories about how these methods may be used.

We discuss problems of incomprehensibility and their possible solutions through digital explanations in pod- and videocasts such as YouTube; problems of interaction, motivation, and immersion that digital games and gamification may solve; problems of the complexity of philosophical content and digital concept- and argument-maps to deal with these; problems of implicitness and the possibility to make implicit things in philosophy class explicit through indirect feedback tools.",

      "abstract": "We provide a quantitative analysis of the philosophy-neuroscience nexus using citation analysis. Combining bibliometric indicators of cross-field visibility with journal citation mapping techniques, we investigate four dimensions of the nexus: how the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and of philosophy in neuroscience has changed over time, which areas of philosophy are more interested in neuroscience, which areas of neuroscience are more interested in philosophy, and how the trading zone between the two fields is configured. We also discuss two hypotheses: the supposed occurrence of a neuro-revolution in philosophy and the role of psychology as the disciplinary link between neuroscience and philosophy. Both the visibility of neuroscience in philosophy and the visibility of philosophy in neuroscience have increased significantly from 1980 to 2020, albeit the latter remains an order of magnitude lower than the former. Neuroscience is particularly visible in philosophy of mind, applied ethics, philosophy of science, but not in \u2018core\u2019 areas of analytic philosophy. Philosophy is particularly visible in cognitive and systems neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, but not in biomedical neuroscience. As for the trading zone between philosophy and neuroscience, our data show that it works differently in philosophy and in neuroscience. While some philosophy journals are active loci of bidirectional communication, neuroscience journals are divided between journals \u2018importing\u2019 philosophy in neuroscience and journals \u2018exporting\u2019 neuroscience to philosophy. Lastly, data do not support the hypothesis that a widespread neuro-revolution has transformed philosophy radically, but support the hypothesis that psychology functions as a mediating disciplinary link between philosophy and neuroscience.",

To test if this is actually the case, we examined university students\u2019 familiarity with the basic tools for argument. Our findings, based on a sample of 651 students enrolled in philosophy courses at six Greek universities, indicate that students who have prior experience with philosophy are more familiar with the basic tools for argument, and that students who have taken philosophy courses at the university have stronger argument-recognition and argument-evaluation skills compared to university students with no prior experience with philosophy. Moreover, our findings suggest that students get more familiar with the basic tools for argument as their level of engagement with philosophy increases, and that they get significantly better at evaluating arguments when they become graduate students in philosophy. However, our findings also suggest that the majority of students in philosophy classrooms haven\u2019t developed fluency in (at least some) basic argument-related concepts and skills. To remedy this, we argue that philosophy instructors need to re-think (a) the place that the teaching of argument has in philosophy courses, and (b) the way that they teach students about argument.",

A major issue of controversy in this debate concerns what pre\u2010reflective self\u2010consciousness is an awareness of. Some scholars have suggested that pre\u2010reflective self\u2010consciousness involves an awareness of the experiencing subject. This \u201cegological view\u201d is opposed to the \u201cnon\u2010egological view,\u201d according to which the subject is just aware of their own occurrent mental state in being pre\u2010reflectively self\u2010conscious. In this article, I argue in favor of the egological view. The argument I develop is a qualified version of a line of reasoning originally provided by Rosenthal and builds on a proper clarification of the ontological status of token mental states. More precisely, I argue that token mental states are structured \u201cfact\u2010like\u201d entities having their subject among their constituents. Accordingly, one cannot be aware of one's own occurrent mental state without thereby being aware of oneself. I conclude by dismissing a potential objection to my argument.",

It identifies the fallacy of the altruistic argument, which frames women\u2019s self-sacrifice in reproductive and caregiving roles as a natural virtue, reinforcing gender inequalities and limiting autonomy. Through an interdisciplinary approach integrating feminist philosophy, evolutionary theory, and social justice perspectives, it exposes androcentric biases in evolutionary epistemology that have legitimized the exploitation of women\u2019s reproductive labor by portraying altruism as a biologically determined, sex-specific trait. Drawing on Adriana Cavarero\u2019s relational ethics, the paper advocates for reimagining reproduction as a collective act rooted in mutual care, ethical responsibility, and interdependence. This perspective challenges Western individualism and calls for positioning reproduction as a central ethical and philosophical category. By rejecting narratives of self-sacrifice, it promotes an ethos of mutuality, fostering a more equitable and inclusive approach to reproductive practices and policies.",
