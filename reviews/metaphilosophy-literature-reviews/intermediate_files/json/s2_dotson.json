      "abstract": "\n In this paper, I introduce a special case of epistemic injustice that I call structural contributory injustice. This conception aims to capture some dimensions of how policy\u2014separately from individual agential interactions\u2014can generate epistemic injustice at a group level. I first locate the case within Kristie Dotson\u2019s original conception of contributory injustice. I then consider one potential case of structural contributory injustice\u2014namely, the policy problem of significant financial risk burden on students considering university in the United States. Finally, I consider potential policy reforms in response to this injustice.",

      "abstract": "Concepts like testimonial injustice (Fricker, 2007) and testimonial violence (Dotson, 2011) articulate that marginalized epistemic agents are unjustly undermined as testifiers when dominant agents cannot or will not hear, understand, or believe their testimony. This paper turns attention away from these constraints on uptake, and towards pragmatic, social, and political constraints on how dominant audiences receive and react to testimony. I argue that these constraints can also be sources of testimonial injustice and epistemic violence. Specifically, I explore a kind of injustice that I call testimonial withdrawal, which occurs when a would-be speaker chooses to remain silent because they know or reasonably expect that there is pragmatic risk associated with speaking, given their unjust marginalization. I argue that this unjustly undermines epistemic agency, and that expanding Fricker and Dotson\u2019s umbrella concepts to accommodate this idea results in a better understanding of the moral and epistemic contours of both testimonial withdrawal and these broader categories.",
