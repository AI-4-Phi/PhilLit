It is argued that despite the terminological differences partially caused by Fichte\u2019s renaming of philosophy and the unclear meaning of \u2018metaphilosophy,\u2019 several options are available. The article suggests considering metaphilosophy as one of the many \u2018meta-constructions\u2019 \u2013 such as the thinking of thinking, philosophizing about the philosophizing, and the metaphysics of metaphysics \u2013 that can be found throughout the history of philosophy and in Fichte\u2019s thought. They follow the figure of self-application, which is compatible with historical and contemporary translations of \u2018meta\u2019 as after, beyond, and about. The available options are the Wissenschaftslehre of philosophy, understood as the revision of philosophy and thematization of deficient or incomplete conceptions of philosophy from the standpoint of the Wissenschaftslehre; the Wissenschaftslehre of the Wissenschaftslehre as the propaedeutic self-reflection, successive reformulation, and picture that emerges with the completion of the system; and philosophy of the Wissenschaftslehre. The latter, the external view of Wissenschaftslehre as one philosophy among others, is almost not present in Fichte. However, it connects Fichte\u2019s Wissenschaftslehre with contemporary metaphilosophy, as demonstrated by Rescher\u2019s topics, benefiting both Fichte scholars and contemporary metaphilosophers.",

In my contribution I show that he is, instead, involved in a sophisticated metaphilosophical project which follows a Socratic spirit.\nYet, there are (almost) no positive characterisations of philosophy to be found in his works: schools, doctrines, and individuals all become the object of biting criticisms or ridicule. Given this situation, we ought to seek the Socratic aspects of Lucian\u2019s project in his critical performance as well as in the criteria his attacks are based on, namely consistency, evidence, and fidelity to the given argument. His metaphilosophy unfolds around three distinctions. The first distinction being that between philosophy and philosophers. In the first part of the paper, I elaborate how Lucian attacks faux philosophers for failing to practice what they preach, that is, for their lack of performative consistency. I also discuss possible positive portrayals of philosophers in his works. The second distinction, which occupies us in the second part, is that between philosophy and philosophies, the multiple schools and traditions. From this multiplicity he constructs a starting problem for philosophy: how do we know which of the philosophies to choose in the first place without already presupposing a philosophical position? A third difference can be adduced, namely that between doctrinal and non-doctrincal philosophy. In Lucian\u2019s perspective, which I summarize in the concluding part of the paper, philosophy is a way of reflexive critical thinking, rather than the dogmatic adherence to the doctrines of a given school.",

Both philosophers, I argue, combined their provisional elaborations of first-order metaphysics with a second-order inquiry into the conditions under which such metaphysics can be turned into a science. Fichte departed from Kant, however, by obfuscating the normative strand of Kant\u2019s conception of critique. I further argue that Fichte\u2019s anodyne conception of critique went hand in hand with the elaboration of a new type of metaphilosophy in the Foundation of the Entire Doctrine of Science, namely, the attempt to derive the principles of deficient philosophical systems from the ultimate principle of human cognition per se. Seen in this way, Fichte transformed the critique of metaphysics carried out in the Critique of Pure Reason into a post-critical type of metaphilosophy that can account for the possibility and necessity of transcendental idealism itself.",

      "abstract": "The discipline of philosophy has been critiqued from both within and outside itself. One brand of external critique is associated with Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), the view that human cognition is partially structured by pervasive and automatic mappings between conceptual domains. Most notably, Lakoff and Johnson (1999) claimed that many central philosophical concepts and arguments rely on an unacknowledged metaphorical substructure, and that this structure has sometimes led philosophy astray. The purpose of this paper is to argue that Lakoff and Johnson's critique is anticipated by the work of post\u2010Tractarian Wittgenstein and his student, Margaret MacDonald. In the Blue Book, Wittgenstein outlines a method for identifying and resolving philosophical puzzles generated by misused grammatical analogies, although his discussion lacks a precise characterization of exactly how and why such analogies lead to trouble. In a 1938 paper, MacDonald offers such a characterization, which I outline and then connect back to Wittgenstein. In addition to this interpretive work, I supplement Wittgenstein and MacDonald's diagnosis using evidence from CMT which suggests that linguistic metaphors and analogies often originate in or are motivated by more fundamental analogical mappings in cognition. The supplemented account carries implications for how philosophical arguments ought to be formulated and critiqued.",

      "abstract": "This study critically examines how Western philosophy constructs epistemic hegemony through historical, methodological, and terminological mechanisms, and explores how non-Western traditions such as Confucianism and Daoism can be recognized as complete and authentic without undergoing conceptual subordination. This research is significant as the discourse of global philosophy remains dominated by Western epistemic structures that limit the plurality of rational forms. Employing a qualitative, literature-based approach, this study analyzes key metaphilosophical texts, Jacques Derrida\u2019s theory of deconstruction, and Alain Badiou\u2019s ontology as conceptual tools to trace power relations embedded in the definitions and boundaries of philosophy. The findings reveal that Western philosophy has institutionalized a linear historical narrative, logical-deductive methodological standards, and a Greek-Latin vocabulary as prerequisites for philosophical validity\u2014resulting in the systematic exclusion of non-Western thought. The study further proposes a conceptual framework of dialogical exclusive multiplicity as an alternative for recognizing truth procedures in non-Western traditions as autonomous and equal. The implications of this research open avenues for deconstructing philosophy as the sole legitimate mode of thinking and promote the formation of a more epistemically just global philosophical ecosystem. The originality of this study lies in its critical synthesis of metaphilosophy, deconstruction, and contemporary ontology to construct an alternative paradigm for cross-traditional philosophical inquiry\u2014one based not on inclusion, but on recognition and articulative equality. \n\u00a0",

Contrary to the usual approach to the subject, I do not consider what the ontological argument reveals about religious language and reasoning, but what it says about the nature of philosophy. I argue that despite Lazerowitz's and Malcolm's common Wittgensteinian background and shared foundations of philosophy, the opposite conclusions they reach about the ontological argument illustrate their opposite views of philosophy. In Malcolm's approach, the ontological argument can be interpreted as an instance of the paradigm case argument, which by showing the bounds of sense is meant to display the work of language in its entirety. From this perspective, the ontological argument is philosophically irrefutable, as one cannot refute a piece of language. For Lazerowitz, the ontological argument is irrefutable as it represents a philosophical intervention into language and thus must be disregarded.",

      "abstract": "This essay attempts to understand the forces behind the current deadlock over globalizing academic philosophy between main-stream Western-style philosophers and its currently marginalized diversity advocates. It first pinpoints what Western-style philosophers might consider threatening or simply uninteresting in some of the major diversity paradigms (\u201cThe Same,\u201d \u201cThe Subaltern,\u201d \u201cThe Samaritan,\u201d and \u201cThe Area Studies Silo\u201d). Second, it introduces a secret weapon nobody seems to have put to use yet: metaphilosophy. It argues that we need to take a deeper historical and philological breath to redraw what and where \u201cphilosophy\u201d has thrived in world history. Only through the detour of a global, deep-time metaphilosophy can we bring the most ingenious human thought and philosophical practice to the table as we battle over a more cosmopolitan future for academic philosophy and try to forge philosophical tools to tackle the global challenges in our world of interlocking social, spiritual, and environmental crises.",

      "abstract": "The recognition of metaphilosophy as a separate independent philosophical discipline forces us to pay attention not only to the various variants of its understanding and its own status, but also to the history of its origin and development. It is believed that the beginning of metaphilosophy as a study of the nature of philosophy was laid by several articles by M. Lazerowitz, although some other philosophers are mentioned in passing. The study characterizes Lazerowitz\u2019s desire to understand metaphilosophy as a view of philosophy \u201cfrom the outside\u201d and demonstrates the failure of this attempt: in fact, his metaphilosophy represents a position \u201cinside\u201d philosophy itself. The author of the research argues that the beginning of philosophy of philosophy should be associated with the works of the Russian and Polish philosopher Heinrich Struve and suggests a broader reconstruction of his approach. A comparison of the works of these philosophers makes it possible to identify their common starting point, which is the statement of the presence of many disagreements in philosophy, that is, what Kant called a \u201cscandal\u201d in philosophy. The differences between the two approaches are also revealed, in particular, Struve\u2019s philosophy of philosophy is a precursor to any philosophy in general, aimed, while maintaining the different points of view of individual philosophers, at developing a \u201ccommon worldview\u201d. As the subject of his philosophy of philosophy, Struve calls a historical and critical analysis of the current state of philosophy, an explanation of the subject, tasks, goals, aspirations and method of philosophy; among the \u201cprinciples\u201d of philosophy is the study of the relationship of philosophy to other \u201cphenomena of mental life.\u201d In addition to Lazerowitz and Struve, the author points to other philosophers (for example, J. Maritain, V. Ern, E. Kalinowsky, T. Oizerman), whose interests include metaphilosophical problems, and a detailed study of their works can help to see a certain historical tradition of metaphilosophy.",

Providing a common explanation to a variety of Heidegger\u2019s pronouncements on the nature of his discipline in seminars and public addresses, the essay stresses their ties to the phenomenological doctrine of Being and Time. My presentation spans four major theses: (1) Philosophy is actual in the practice of philosophizing, understood as an activity of intrinsic worth. (2) The essential procedure of philosophizing is clarification of experience. (3) The medium of philosophizing is conceptual knowledge. (4) The goal of philosophizing is non-conceptual: a \u201cfundamental attunement.\u201d Focusing on the apparent tension between (3) and (4), I argue that the structural relations between the conceptual and the non-conceptual elements in Heidegger\u2019s metaphilosophy are best accounted for in terms of the duality of understanding (Verstehen) and being-attuned (Befindlichkeit) in the existential analytic. In conclusion, I suggest that the metaphilosophical vision this analysis yields is faithful to the existential promise of philosophy and provides the conceptual resources to defend its essential status as a mode of human realization.",

This paper focuses on the third project. In particular, it explores one of the most intriguing yet puzzling aspects of Kant\u2019s philosophy, viz. the relationship between what Kant calls \u2018pure\u2019 philosophy vs. \u2018applied\u2019, \u2018empirical\u2019 or what we can broadly refer to as \u2018impure\u2019 philosophy. (As we shall see, in order to be able to address this third project, we shall also need to examine the other two projects in detail.) My plan is as follows. First, I discuss four main areas of pure vs. impure philosophy: (i) \u2018pure logic\u2019 vs. \u2018applied logic\u2019; (ii) \u2018rational psychology\u2019 vs. \u2018empirical psychology\u2019; (iii) \u2018pure metaphysics of nature\u2019 vs. \u2018physics\u2019 and (iv) \u2018pure morality\u2019 or a \u2018metaphysics of morals\u2019 vs. \u2018moral anthropology\u2019, \u2018practical anthropology\u2019 or \u2018applied moral philosophy\u2019. Based on this, I identify four key differences between pure and impure philosophy. Second, I critically examine four different readings of Kant\u2019s views about the status of \u2018impure\u2019 philosophy: (a) that it is not genuine philosophy; (b) that it is bad or inferior philosophy; (c) that it is instrumentally valuable; and (d) that it constitutes an indispensable part of Kant\u2019s philosophy, both in a theoretical and practical sense. I argue that Kant is best interpreted as endorsing readings (c) and (d). Third, I offer some concluding remarks.",

Using the example of analytical, linguis\u00adtic, pragmatic and ontological turns, an attempt is made to highlight the characteristic fea\u00adtures of \u201cturns\u201d. The author shows that the analytical turn is associated with the develop\u00adment of methods of philosophy, primarily with the diversification of the concept of analy\u00adsis itself. Consideration of the linguistic turn leads to the position that its characterization as a change in the subject of philosophy is not quite adequate \u2013 in fact, it is a change in the methods of philosophical analysis, which leads to the emergence of new problem areas not only in philosophy, but also in linguistics. The pragmatic turn is characterized by emphasizing the role of pragmatism in overcoming the existing opposition of analytic and continental philosophy through the use of both logical and, for example, axiological methods or the \u201cpragmatic principle\u201d. The ontological turn, characteristic of anthropol\u00adogy, the philosophy of technology, as well as for \u201cgeneral\u201d philosophy, is associated with a change in the methods of analysis in the direction of solving the problem of seeing \u201cthings in a new way\u201d and how \u201cthey really are\u201d. The analysis in the case of an ontologi\u00adcal turn is aimed not so much at \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d as at \u201cmulti-naturalism\u201d, at taking into account the active role of the subject and building the research models capable of taking this into account. The final position of the author is that according to which a \u201cturn\u201d is a change in research methods that leads to the formation of a new subject area and the formulation of new problems. They, in turn, stimulate the next \u201cturn\u201d and the de\u00advelopment of new methods and methodologies.",

The relevance of the article is due to the presence of a variety of metaphilosophical concepts, which, pursuing one common goal \u2013 to understand and explain what philosophy is, come to different and often contradictory conclusions. The article aims to compare the metaphilosophical concepts of domestic and foreign authors (T. I. Oizerman, M. K. Mamardashvili, J. Deleuze and F. Guattari, T. Williamson and N. Rescher) according to certain criteria. Within the framework of the task, it is proposed to identify the essential characteristics of the concept of \"philosophy\" of the listed authors and to propose a variant of the typology of modern concepts of metaphilosophy. The article uses the method of comparative analysis. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the author, analyzing the existing typologies of metaphilosophical concepts (on a conceptual and methodological basis), offers a third variant of the typology in relation to the possibility of progress in philosophy and its prospects. The author draws attention to the fact that the understanding of metaphilosophy in the concepts of the scientists under consideration (Oiserman, Williamson, Rescher, Deleuze and Guattari) reveals interesting parallels and collisions. The author comes to the conclusion that in order to better understand the nature of metaphilosophy, it is necessary to identify the essential characteristics of the concept of metaphilosophy in the concepts of different scientists. The picture of metaphilosophy turns out to be diverse and contradictory, because according to the authors considered, metaphilosophy is \"cabinet\"; - pluralistic; - \"aporic\"; - self-reflexive; - dialectical; - is in constant development; - guided by the principles of pragmatism and efficiency; - able to give satisfactory answers to current questions; - is not absolutely rational, but contains an element of intuition.\n",

It argues that the challenge to explain the (defeasible) justification of our mathematical beliefs ('the justificatory challenge'), arises insofar as disagreement over axioms bottoms out in disagreement over intuitions. And it argues that the challenge to explain their reliability ('the reliability challenge'), arises to the extent that we could have easily had different beliefs. The Element shows that mathematical facts are not, in general, empirically accessible, contra Quine, and that they cannot be dispensed with, contra Field. However, it argues that they might be so plentiful that our knowledge of them is unmysterious. The Element concludes with a complementary 'pluralism' about modality, logic and normative theory, highlighting its surprising implications. Metaphysically, pluralism engenders a kind of perspectivalism and indeterminacy. Methodologically, it vindicates Carnap's pragmatism, transposed to the key of realism.",

To him, Pyrrhonism \u201ccombines philosophical scepticism with scepticism about philosophy, that is, to have doubts about philosophy on the basis of philosophical arguments\u201d (1994, p. 3). Following this interpretation, Neopyrrhonism can be understood as a kind of scepticism that cancels philosophy using self-destructive arguments (peritrope). Both Sextus -with his proposal of suspension of judgment- and Wittgenstein -with his idea of the dissolution of philosophical problems- are representatives of quietism. Neopyrrhonism as quietism can be conceived of as a therapeutic proposal mainly based on not postulating an argumentative-constructive philosophical theory. Against this perspective, I propose interpreting Neopyrrhonism as Metaphilosophy, from which a performative proposal emerges. In this approach, Neopyrrhonism is an open-ended inquiry that implies the ability of using different philosophical argumentative strategies in a performative sense to encourage a new way of exercising philosophy.\u00a0",

What unites their projects is the thesis that philosophy must begin with an investigation of its own nature, and that this investigation, because of its special object, must be accompanied by a reflection on its method. To this end, their methods are discussed on the assumption that these methods arise from a particular engagement with the theories and practices of the 18th century sciences. Finally, this discussion provides the basis for showing in what ways philosophical experiments, fictions, or models offer methodological solutions to the problem of developing a scientific metaphysics.",

This problem is examined through the life and philosophical doctrine of G. Skovoroda.

In the second part, I will analyze eight elements for an \u201cimperfect definition\u201d (KrV A731/B759) of philosophy outlining the scope of Kant\u2019s explicit metaphilosophy against the backdrop of recent metaphilosophical research: (i) scientific concept of philosophy, (ii) philosophy as an activity, (iii) worldly concept, (iv) philosophy as a (proper and improper) science, (v) philosophy as an architectonic idea (archetype and ectypes), (vi) philosophy as a social practice and the appropriate holding-to-be-true (one or many true philosophies?), (vii) reason as the absolute condition and subject of philosophy, and (viii) methodology of philosophy. I will put these elements together for an attempt to give an imperfect definition of philosophy\u2009\u2013\u2009something that Kant promised but never did\u2009\u2013\u2009in the conclusion.",
