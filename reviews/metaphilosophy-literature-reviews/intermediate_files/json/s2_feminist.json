      "abstract": "\n The subject of this research is a critical analysis of the Confucian canon \"Li Ji\" from a feminist perspective, grounded in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. The study focuses on the ethical status of women within the Confucian ritual-moral system and reveals how female subjectivity is structurally excluded from the realm of ethical expression. Attention is given to both the textual mechanisms that reinforce gender otherness and the forms of female response, which are simultaneously imbued with emotionality and normative discipline. Using Levinas's concept of the Other, the work aims to show that women in \"Li Ji\" function as ethical carriers but not as recognized subjects capable of calling to account. Thus, the research contributes to understanding the possibility of the female voice as the beginning of ethical relations within the patriarchal canon. The study employs a comparative philosophical method, combining a critical reading of the Confucian text with feminist analysis and the conceptual apparatus of Levinas's ethics to reveal gender asymmetries in the structure of moral recognition. The scientific novelty of the research lies in the interdisciplinary interpretation of the Confucian canon \"Li Ji\" at the intersection of feminist critique and the ethical philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas. The main methods used include hermeneutic analysis, intertextual approaches, and critical-discursive readings of key concepts such as \"ritual,\" \"obedience,\" and \"difference.\" The study shows that despite women's active participation in ritual-ethical practice, their status as a Person remains invisible and unrecognized within the moral structure. The work demonstrates how the normative logic of the text generates an effect of ethical silence, structurally placing women in the position of the responding subject while excluding them from the possibility of being initiators of moral calls. This gender bias in the Confucian model necessitates philosophical deconstruction. In conclusion, the necessity to rethink the very foundation of ethical relations and affirm the female voice as an equal and autonomous source of ethical subjectivity and moral expression is emphasized.\n",

      "abstract": "Genesis 2-3 has always been a text to which feminism and especially feminist theology has paid special attention because it is one of the main passages of the canon that deal directly with the relationship between the sexes. One of the main goals of feminist exegesis has been to overcome the predominance of the traditional, patriarchal interpretations of the text by developing alternative, feminist readings, and it is (or should be) widely acknowledged that they have successfully done so. But what I want to show is that if one steps back from the theological perspective for a moment and examines the common feminist interpretations from a philosophical point of view, more precisely in the light of the general critique of traditional feminism brought forward by the philosopher Judith Butler in her well-known book \u201cGender Trouble\u201d, one might nevertheless be worried if feminist critique has gotten far enough in their re-interpretation of Genesis 2-3.",

As such, the paper traces the philosophical roots of deconstruction in the works of Frederick Nietzsche up to Jacque Derrida, among other contributors. The paper also dwells on the mechanism of deconstructive reading of text, especially its deviation from the structuralist approach. A particular emphasis is placed on the employment of deconstruction in the feminist canon, through paying attention to the deconstructive feminist views of notable feminist critics like Helen Cixous, Luce Irigary, among others. Finally, the paper surveys some of the critique made against the deconstructive approach and the defence made in return.

The first part explains Aristotle's theory of justice and offers the feminist critique. Plato's theory of justice explained in Republic, with ideas about philosopher queens, is examined in the second part. The third part discusses premodern and some contemporary theories of justice that preserve patriarchal patterns of devaluating women within a private-public dichotomy, while the fourth part presents the mainstream and feminist theories of justice that overcome a dominant pattern and affirm gender justice in a converging manner. The concluding remarks sum up the crucial role of gender justice for benchmarking further philosophizing on justice.",

      "abstract": "The philosophical canon has long been criticized for its lack of diversity, particularly in terms of gender. Feminist thinkers have challenged this tradition, arguing that it reflects a narrow and exclusionary view of the world. The present article examines the ways in which feminist philosophers have contributed to expanding the philosophical canon through their critiques of traditional philosophy and the inclusion of previously marginalized perspectives. Drawing on the principles of intersectionality, feminist thinkers have highlighted the ways in which various forms of oppression intersect and reinforce one another. By doing so, they have exposed the limitations of traditional philosophical approaches and expanded the scope of philosophical inquiry. This article argues that the work of feminist philosophers has not only enriched the philosophical canon, but also helped to challenge and transform the dominant cultural narratives that have historically excluded marginalized voices. Ultimately, this article advocates for greater recognition and inclusion of feminist perspectives in the philosophical canon, as a means of promoting a more diverse and inclusive understanding of the world.",

First, it sketches out the nature of critique as a de-canonising practice within IR theory and how critique has itself become the target of resistance in recent strands of feminist and decolonial inspired abolitionist thinking. Second, it explores the politics of challenging the canon drawing on the example of the WHIT project, which I suggest is better captured using the language of epistemic justice than either critique or abolition. In conclusion, it draws out the lessons of this analysis for understandings of the ethos and practice of resisting the canon.",

It asks two guiding questions: How should we understand the relationship between trans and nonbinary identities? And what kind of trans materialism can meaningfully respond to our current political moment? The article focuses on three problematics: (1) the reliance on abstract philosophical critiques of gender identity; (2) the framing of trans and nonbinary identities as objective versus subjective, respectively; and (3) the portrayal of nonbinary identity as emblematic of neoliberal ideology. Drawing on posttranssexual (Susan Stryker, Sandy Stone), travesti (Lohana Berkins, Marlene Wayar), and nonbinary (Eris Young, Travis Alabanza) narratives\u2014as well as critical feminist theory (Judith Butler, Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib, Regina Becker-Schmidt)\u2014the article argues for understanding gender identity claims as situated political practices that are simultaneously subjectively and objectively constituted. It critiques positivist tendencies within trans materialism and challenges polarizing distinctions between trans and nonbinary identities. Ultimately, it builds on Wendy Brown's definition of neoliberalism to argue that dismissing nonbinary identities on materialist grounds risks constructing the trans critic as a neutral subject outside power, becoming another site for the hollowing out of democratic practice. The article calls for a trans materialism grounded in self-critical feminist analysis and relational political practice.",

      "abstract": "Within contemporary philosophical discourse we find different thinkers that, with the aim to criticize Western dominant thought, by them addressed as \u2018phallocentric\u2019, directly refer to Hegelian texts. This paper will present one author who have openly spoken out a feminist critique of Hegelian thought, and in particular of the sexual division described by the Stuttgart philosopher, culminating in the ethical state \u2013 representing the constitution of the modern state \u2013 with the confinement of the feminine within the domestic sphere and, conversely, the liberation of the masculine within community political life. \nThe thinker who will be analyzed is the Italian activist and philosopher Carla Lonzi, author of the renowned Sputiamo su Hegel (Let\u2019s Spit on Hegel) and precursor of the Italian sexual difference feminism. The author confronted the political division implemented by Hegel within the ethical state between the two sexes, trying to show how Hegel\u2019s work strongly contributed to the constitution of the patriarchal symbolic order still in force in Western thought. The fundamental point of the author\u2019s thought is, in fact, the conviction that the symbolic and linguistic structures of Western culture are something deeply rooted and, therefore, very complex to change. This helps us to understand why in Europe, despite the implementation of various legislative changes \u2013 such as, for example, the establishment of anti-violence centers, the recognition of gender violence at a legal level, the sanctions against gender discrimination in the workplace \u2013 the patriarchal dynamics typical of Western thought are changing too slowly (when they are): gender violence is the order of the day, the pay gap is far from being healed, and, above all, the division of gender roles between care work and productive work is still strongly present. \nThis text, therefore, seeks to demonstrate that the philosophical scope that accompanied the formation of European thought also characterized its darker features, including the patriarchal perspective. Here, we will analyze a particular aspect of patriarchy, focusing on its elaboration within Hegelian political philosophy: the presumed ontological and biological/natural destination of the female to domestic work and the male to public life. \nTo this end, the article is divided into two parts. In the first part, the concept of sexual difference as developed by Hegel will be presented, analyzing its development within the three parts of his philosophical system. In the second part, a part of Lonzi\u2019s thought will be briefly analyzed, to then articulate her critique of the Hegelian division of gender roles. \n\u00a0 \n",

      "abstract": "abstract Nowhere cool\u2019, a short story by Ama Ata Aidoo, is divided into two sections. In the first, a child sits in a classroom in what is presumably Ghana, feeling alienated by the \u201cfamiliar things that were begin chased away by the demands of the culture of our conquerors\u201d in the literature discussed by the teacher (2002, p. 136). In the second, a Ghanaian woman travels in a plane across the United States of America (USA). She notices a plastic address tag on the baby of the woman next to her, and starts thinking of plastic as material, of oil and of how slavery makes humans into cargo. This short story therefore consists of philosophical rumination on the nature of humans\u2019 relationship to material and literary objects. I read \u2018Nowhere cool\u2019 as part of a black feminist epistemological tradition aimed at exposing the situatedness of supposedly neutral western thought, and at emphasising the embodiment and social embeddedness of all knowledge. I argue that the story\u2019s specific focus on the nonhuman and on extractive economies allows for it to be read as a corrective to the same universalising gestures in posthumanist considerations of the nonhuman. I bring the story into dialogue with Graham Harman\u2019s (2018) Object-oriented Ontology (OOO) to contend that while OOO is aimed at criticising anthropocentrism, a specific human perspective (that of the western white male) is \u201coverrepresented\u201d (Wynter 2003) in it. This has consequences for OOO and posthumanism more generally, since it means that the new relationship to the nonhuman Harman proposes is divorced from the reality of many humans\u2019 relationship with the nonhuman. Posthuman ontologies need to build on the insights of black feminism in order to not replicate the skewed nature and resultant inaccuracies of hegemonic theories of the past.",

In this article, I argue that the epistemological roundness of this concept is, in actuality, a by-product of philosophical reification of Amerindian cosmological dynamics. This reification stems from distortive abstractions of specific societal structures, which rely on the silencing of two key phenomena: the fact that the central or unmarked perspective assumed in \u2018perspectivism\u2019 is that of men, and the fact that the valorisation of men\u2019s perspective is enabled by the exchange and accumulation of women. By unearthing this exchange system that lies behind the cyclical valuation of males\u2019 gaze, I do not seek to denounce the role of actual women in Amerindian societies. My central aim is to demonstrate that both perspectival anthropology\u2019s depiction of Amerindian cosmology and what Viveiros de Castro calls \u2018Western objectivist epistemology\u2019 are made possible by the erasure of women\u2019s capacity for transcendence.",

In this contribution, therefore, I also aim to show \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 these efforts of Habermas\u2019s could be complemented. The former is an exploration of novel post-structuralist ideas on inclusive \u2018both/and\u2019 theory appropriation. I briefly outline the nuanced intellectual history of the Frankfurt School between the first and second generations, which is Habermas\u2019s seminal contribution to this tradition. Carol Gilligan\u2019s \u2018ethic of care,\u2019 around which a more caring, responsive society might be (re)constructed, is then applied. Against this backdrop, Lakoff\u2019s and Gerhardt\u2019s proposals for the caring society, based on investigations into the link between authoritarian parenting and capitalism, are taken into consideration. These ideas are supported with an outline of recent progress within neuroscience that demonstrates the benefits of both early emotional nurturing and an appropriate attachment paradigm. It is thus argued that feminism, as part of a richer interdisciplinary methodology, could meaningfully correct and thereafter complement Habermas\u2019s shortcomings, with post-structuralism as the methodological glue that adheres Habermas\u2019s universalistic project with feminists\u2019 emphases on specificity. \n\n\n\u201cOne of the things about looking at the world through a feminist lens is [the awareness] that we are already in a dystopia.\u201d \u2014 Leni Zumas, author of Red Clocks (2018 ), part of a growing canon of woman-written dystopian fiction.",

      "abstract": "Rosemary Kellison\u2019s new book builds on the growing body of feminist just war scholarship to pose a critique of the just war tradition that draws on a relational theory of autonomy. Humans are relational beings; therefore, all of our actions can only be understood within the multitude of relationships we have and the power structures into which those relationships fall. Because of this interdependency, human action may have unintended consequences, which bears greater attention in just war thinking. Unlike her predecessors, Kellison conducts an immanent critique of the tradition, thereby \u201cfocus[ing] not on the concepts of gender, women, patriarchy, and masculinity, but instead on modern Western ethical categories such as tradition, agency, intention, and justice\u201d (p. \uf644\uf646). Expanding Responsibility for the Just War demonstrates a thorough command of the just war canon, and as a result, the scholars with whom she engages will be hard-pressed to dismiss her position, at least not without considerable effort. Indeed, in an era of inclusive academia, it would behoove more just war scholars to incorporate feminist critiques with greater epistemological tolerance, starting with this book. Kellison begins by noting that her \u201ccentral focus is on the tradition of moral reasoning that has come to underlie international humanitarian law and US military policy,\u201d and says she is \u201cespecially interested in the ways this reasoning justifies practices of assigning, taking, and evading responsibility\u2014particularly for acts that cause harm to non-combatants, the most vulnerable persons in any armed conflict\u201d (p. \uf646). Indeed, the book is clearly structured as a journey into the heart of intention, which figures in both jus ad bellum and jus in bello principles in the criteria of right intention and discrimination, respectively. Kellison criticizes the evasion of responsibility for noncombatant deaths in war, which a narrow understanding of intention and the weighing of proportionality and double effect allows. She argues this traditional approach may often be self-serving, as it only thinly recognizes the harm that comes to noncombatants in war. Instead, she reconceptualizes and expands intention via relational autonomy, which in turn allows for a more inclusive, more aware, understanding of responsibility for harm. In a clear and succinct discussion of relational autonomy, Kellison establishes the ties that bind people to each other. Kellison is also deeply cognizant of the power dynamics that allow people to diminish these relational ties, leading to some level of dehumanization of a weaker \u201cother.\u201d Dehumanization allows a vulnerable other to be harmed with seemingly little recognition of this harm, and thus just war theorizing must take into account that \u201cone group of persons who have beenmademuchmore vulnerable than others because of their particular situation within power relationships is civilians living in areas where violent force is being used\u201d (p. \uf646\uf646).",
