      "abstract": "Introduction As a research methodology, phenomenology is uniquely positioned to help health professions education (HPE) scholars learn from the experiences of others. Phenomenology is a form of qualitative research that focuses on the study of an individual\u2019s lived experiences within the world. Although it is a powerful approach for inquiry, the nature of this methodology is often intimidating to HPE researchers. This article aims to explain phenomenology by reviewing the key philosophical and methodological differences between two of the major approaches to phenomenology: transcendental and hermeneutic. Understanding the ontological and epistemological assumptions underpinning these approaches is essential for successfully conducting phenomenological research. Purpose This review provides an introduction to phenomenology and demonstrates how it can be applied to HPE research. We illustrate the two main sub-types of phenomenology and detail their ontological, epistemological, and methodological differences. Conclusions Phenomenology is a powerful research strategy that is well suited for exploring challenging problems in HPE. By building a better understanding of the nature of phenomenology and working to ensure proper alignment between the specific research question and the researcher\u2019s underlying philosophy, we hope to encourage HPE scholars to consider its utility when addressing their research questions.",

Bellmund et al. review and combine concepts from cognitive science and philosophy with findings from neurophysiology of spatial navigation in rodents to propose a framework for cognitive neuroscience. They argue that spatial-processing principles in the hippocampalentorhinal region provide a geometric code to map information domains of cognitive spaces for high-level cognition and discuss recent evidence for this proposal.

Although philosophy is a curriculum that becomes widespread with Children for Philosophy developed by Matthew Lipman in Turkey, it is not a curriculum that becomes widespread in preschool period, a period that brain development is on such important. In preschool period that is seen as the most important period in terms of brain development, it is required that children are given the education that will positively affect their neuroplasticity (the flexibility of brain neurons). When the importance of philosophy education programs in early years on children is considered, the importance of giving philosophy education as a thinking skills education program positively affecting children\u2019s thinking skills at first and their skills in all developmental areas in preschool period, becoming widespread these programs and increasing the resources for these programs emerges. Therefore, this study was a review article prepared by the aim of emphasizing the importance of philosophy education in preschool period as a stimuli for brain development, drawing attention to the importance of conducting these programs prevalently and systematically. \u00a9 2020, Ankara University.

This transition was ushered in mainly because of the high throughput demands for 5G New Radio (NR). The new channel coding solution also needs to support incremental-redundancy hybrid ARQ, and a wide range of blocklengths and coding rates, with stringent performance guarantees and minimal description complexity. In this article, we first briefly review the requirements of the new channel code for 5G NR. We then describe the LDPC code design philosophy and how the broad requirements of 5G NR channel coding led to the introduction of novel structural features in the code design, culminating in an LDPC code that satisfies all the demands of 5G NR.",

In scaffold-based bone tissue engineering, a high performance scaffold underpins the success of a bone tissue engineering strategy and a major direction in the field is to produce bone tissue engineering scaffolds with desirable shape, structural, physical, chemical and biological features for enhanced biological performance and for regenerating complex bone tissues. Three-dimensional (3D) printing can produce customized scaffolds that are highly desirable for bone tissue engineering. The enormous interest in 3D printing and 3D printed objects by the science, engineering and medical communities has led to various developments of the 3D printing technology and wide investigations of 3D printed products in many industries, including biomedical engineering, over the past decade. It is now possible to create novel bone tissue engineering scaffolds with customized shape, architecture, favorable macro-micro structure, wettability, mechanical strength and cellular responses. This article provides a concise review of recent advances in the R & D of 3D printing of bone tissue engineering scaffolds. It also presents our philosophy and research in the designing and fabrication of bone tissue engineering scaffolds through 3D printing.",

      "abstract": "Purpose \u201cTechnological intelligence\u201d is the capacity to appreciate and adapt technological advancements, and \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is the key to achieve persuasive operational transformations in majority of contemporary organizational set-ups. Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics. Design/methodology/approach As rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article. A sum of 1,854 articles extracted from Scopus database for the year 2018\u20132019 (31st of May) with selected keywords (artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, agent-based systems, expert systems, big data analytics and operations management) along with certain filters (subject\u2013business, management and accounting; language-English; document\u2013article, article in press, review articles and source-journals). Findings Results obtained from cluster analysis focus on predominant themes for present as well as future researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. Emerged clusters include Cluster 1: Artificial Intelligence and Optimization; Cluster 2: Industrial Engineering/Research and Automation; Cluster 3: Operational Performance and Machine Learning; Cluster 4: Sustainable Supply Chains and Sustainable Development; Cluster 5: Technology Adoption and Green Supply Chain Management and Cluster 6: Internet of Things and Reverse Logistics. Originality/value The result of review of selected studies is in itself a unique contribution and a food for thought for operations managers and policy makers.",

      "abstract": "It has been a long-held belief that judicious resource allocation is critical to mitigating interference, improving network efficiency, and ultimately optimizing wireless communication performance. The traditional wisdom is to explicitly formulate resource allocation as an optimization problem and then exploit mathematical programming to solve the problem to a certain level of optimality. Nonetheless, as wireless networks become increasingly diverse and complex, for example, in the high-mobility vehicular networks, the current design methodologies face significant challenges and thus call for rethinking of the traditional design philosophy. Meanwhile, deep learning, with many success stories in various disciplines, represents a promising alternative due to its remarkable power to leverage data for problem solving. In this article, we discuss the key motivations and roadblocks of using deep learning for wireless resource allocation with application to vehicular networks. We review major recent studies that mobilize the deep-learning philosophy in wireless resource allocation and achieve impressive results. We first discuss deep-learning-assisted optimization for resource allocation. We then highlight the deep reinforcement learning approach to address resource allocation problems that are difficult to handle in the traditional optimization framework. We also identify some research directions that deserve further investigation.",

The theory of consumption value (TCV) is a marketing theory that provides insight into the motivation for consumers' consumption behaviour through consumption values. Although it offers theoretical explanations about consumer behaviour on a large scale, there is no single article in the literature providing comprehensive and integrated knowledge of TCV and a future research agenda based on a systematic literature review. The main aims of this paper are to present integrated knowledge and provide propositions for future research. This review research covers peer\u2010reviewed journal articles that used this theory and were published between 1991 and 2020. The major findings in the review demonstrate that this theory has remained up to date in the consumer behaviour literature, has been dynamic and has been comprehensively used to explain choice behaviour. Thus, further understanding has been provided for consumer behaviour related to drivers of consumption, although some issues require further examination. Directions for future research are developed in more detail to encourage and advance the understanding of value through TCV.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been a surge of empirical research investigating mental disorders as complex systems. In this article, we investigate how to best make use of this growing body of empirical research and move the field toward its fundamental aims of explaining, predicting, and controlling psychopathology. We first review the contemporary philosophy of science literature on scientific theories and argue that fully achieving the aims of explanation, prediction, and control requires that we construct formal theories of mental disorders: theories expressed in the language of mathematics or a computational programming language. We then investigate three routes by which one can use empirical findings (i.e., data models) to construct formal theories: (a) using data models themselves as formal theories, (b) using data models to infer formal theories, and (c) comparing empirical data models to theory-implied data models in order to evaluate and refine an existing formal theory. We argue that the third approach is the most promising path forward. We conclude by introducing the abductive formal theory construction (AFTC) framework, informed by both our review of philosophy of science and our methodological investigation. We argue that this approach provides a clear and promising way forward for using empirical research to inform the generation, development, and testing of formal theories both in the domain of psychopathology and in the broader field of psychological science.

      "abstract": "Yoga is the most popular complementary health approach practiced by adults in the United States. It is an ancient mind and body practice with origins in Indian philosophy. Yoga combines physical postures, rhythmic breathing and meditative exercise to offer the practitioners a unique holistic mind-body experience. While the health benefits of physical exercise are well established, in recent years, the active attentional component of breathing and meditation practice has garnered interest among exercise neuroscientists. As the scientific evidence for the physical and mental health benefits of yoga continues to grow, this article aims to summarize the current knowledge of yoga practice and its documented positive effects for brain structure and function, as assessed with MRI, fMRI, and SPECT. We reviewed 11 studies examining the effects of yoga practice on the brain structures, function and cerebral blood flow. Collectively, the studies demonstrate a positive effect of yoga practice on the structure and/or function of the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and brain networks including the default mode network (DMN). The studies offer promising early evidence that behavioral interventions like yoga may hold promise to mitigate age-related and neurodegenerative declines as many of the regions identified are known to demonstrate significant age-related atrophy.",

This article reviews work published since DiMaggio's agenda-setting piece\u2014research that builds on cross-disciplinary links between cultural sociology and the cognitive sciences. These works present new ideas on the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of culture, on how forms of personal culture interact, on how culture becomes shared, and on how social interaction and cultural environments inform cognitive processes. Within our discussion, we point to research questions that remain unsettled. We then conclude with issues for future research in culture and cognition that can enrich sociological analysis about action more generally.",

Within psychology, the American Psychological Association has highlighted the importance of cultural diversity in both undergraduate and graduate curricula and charged educators with facilitating the development of cultural competence among learners. Statement of the Problem: Many resources have been developed to help promote EDI within higher education. The resources developed have mainly focused on the curricula and pedagogical approaches, yet the syllabus remains overlooked with few guidelines available to educators. Literature Review: We offer several considerations informed by theoretical frameworks and best practices in the discipline and suggestions for the successful implementation of EDI in the syllabus. Teaching Implications: This article provides a comprehensive and useful guide for developing a syllabus that assists with the integration of EDI, as the syllabus is the first opportunity for faculty to communicate their philosophy, expectations, requirements, and other course information. Conclusion: Infusing EDI in the syllabus is essential for promoting an inclusive learning environment and is conducive to establishing goals related to cultural competence.",

First, we summarize the debate regarding whether performance on implicit measures is explained by conscious or unconscious representations. Second, we discuss the cognitive structure of the operative constructs: are they associatively or propositionally structured? Third, we review debates about whether performance on implicit measures reflects traits or states. Fourth, we discuss the question of whether a person's performance on an implicit measure reflects characteristics of the person who is taking the test or characteristics of the situation in which the person is taking the test. Finally, we survey the debate about the relationship between implicit measures and (other kinds of) behavior.

      "abstract": "Inclusive education is a philosophy and practice that has been promoted internationally. Most scholars now agree that inclusion is more than the placement of students with exceptionalities in a general education class. Instead, definitions of inclusion have expanded to encompass feelings of belongingness. This definition is an improvement, but begs the question: how do we help students to feel more of a part of their class? Ableist attitudes held by students without special education needs may be hindering inclusive ideals. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of current research (2012-2019) on students\u2019 attitudes toward disability. The searching strategy resulted in 37 peer-reviewed journal articles. This review offers a synthesis of the research in the field, which includes determinant studies and intervention studies. The article pool includes 21 determinant studies and 16 intervention studies. Eight determinant and three intervention themes are presented. Recommendations for future research and implications for inclusive education are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The main objectives of this theoretical paper are to compare some constructivist-related learning theories and explore how they can be adequately used in educational technology and distance education. After a brief introduction, constructivism is defined as a general philosophy of education encompassing several different learning theories. The article then presents and discusses the following theories: situated cognition, activity theory, experiential learning, anchored instruction, and authentic learning. Connectivism or distributed learning is also presented as a new and important theory, including its pedagogical view and practice in massive open online courses (MOOCs). These theories are then organized in a coherent way, classified under the constructivist umbrella, pointing their common and distinctive features. Connectivism is positioned as a new philosophy of education for the digital age, making Vygotsky\u2019s concept of zone of proximal development (ZPD) more flexible and stretching it to include learning that lies outside the learner, in social networks and technological tools. The text finally proposes further work on how these theories can be properly combined and used as frameworks for constructivist projects and activities in the fields of educational technology and distance education. The article is based on the search and review of peer-reviewed articles on constructivism, connectivism, the other aforementioned theories, and education technology and distance education._________________________________________________________Este art\u00edculo te\u00f3rico pretende comparar algunas teor\u00edas de aprendizaje relacionadas con el constructivismo y explorar c\u00f3mo pueden usarse adecuadamente en el campo de la tecnolog\u00eda educativa y la educaci\u00f3n a distancia. Despu\u00e9s de una breve introducci\u00f3n, el constructivismo queda definido como una filosof\u00eda general de la educaci\u00f3n que abarca varias teor\u00edas de aprendizaje diferentes. El art\u00edculo presenta y analiza las siguientes teor\u00edas: cognici\u00f3n situada, teor\u00eda de la actividad, aprendizaje experiencial, instrucci\u00f3n anclada y aprendizaje aut\u00e9ntico. El conectivismo o aprendizaje distribuido tambi\u00e9n se presenta como una nueva e importante teor\u00eda, que incluye su visi\u00f3n pedag\u00f3gica y pr\u00e1ctica en cursos masivos y abiertos en l\u00ednea (MOOCs). Organizamos estas teor\u00edas de manera coherente bajo el paraguas constructivista e indicamos las principales similitudes y diferencias entre ellas. El conectivismo se posiciona como una nueva filosof\u00eda de la educaci\u00f3n para la era digital, flexibilizando y ampliando el concepto de Zona de Desarrollo Pr\u00f3ximo (ZDP) de Vygotsky para incluir el aprendizaje que se encuentra fuera del alumno, en redes sociales y herramientas tecnol\u00f3gicas. El texto finalmente propone un trabajo adicional sobre c\u00f3mo estas teor\u00edas pueden combinarse y utilizarse adecuadamente como marcos para proyectos y actividades constructivistas en los campos de la tecnolog\u00eda educativa y la educaci\u00f3n a distancia. El art\u00edculo se basa en la investigaci\u00f3n y revisi\u00f3n de art\u00edculos revisados por pares sobre el constructivismo, el conectivismo, las otras teor\u00edas mencionadas y la tecnolog\u00eda educativa y la educaci\u00f3n a distancia.",

      "abstract": "Industrial improvement approaches such as Lean management are increasingly being adopted in health care. Synthesis is necessary to ensure these approaches are evidence based and requires operationalization of concepts to ensure all relevant studies are included. This article outlines the process utilized to develop an operational definition of Lean in health care. The literature search, screening, data extraction, and data synthesis processes followed the recommendations outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration. Development of the operational definition utilized the methods prescribed by Kinsman et al. and Wieland et al. This involved extracting characteristics of Lean, synthesizing similar components to establish an operational definition, applying this definition, and updating the definition to address shortcomings. We identified two defining characteristics of Lean health-care management: (1) Lean philosophy, consisting of Lean principles and continuous improvement, and (2) Lean activities, which include Lean assessment activities and Lean improvement activities. The resulting operational definition requires that an organization or subunit of an organization had integrated Lean philosophy into the organization\u2019s mandate, guidelines, or policies and utilized at least one Lean assessment activity or Lean improvement activity. This operational definition of Lean management in health care will act as an objective screening criterion for our systematic review. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based operational definition of Lean management in health care.",

      "abstract": "Background. Ubuntu has been proposed as a useful alternative to current (Western) ethical frameworks for evaluating global bioethical issues, contributing theoretical diversity to the clinical context. However, the literature regarding this philosophy is often described as confusing, and is characterised by a number of competing interpretations. Objective. To arrive, by way of a systematic review, at a definition of ubuntu that encompasses the common themes that appear in competing interpretations. Methods. Searches were done in PhilPaper, PubMed and Google Scholar using a variety of search strings, generating 1 207 hits. After screening for English language, as well as relevance of the article after reading the title, abstract and full text, 99 articles were included for review. Another 17 articles were identified through snowballing and additional searches, giving a total of 116 articles that were included in the review. Results. This review shows that ubuntu is an essentially relational ethics, which prizes relationships of interdependence, fellowship, reconciliation, relationality, community friendliness, harmonious relationships and other-regarding actions such as compassion and actions that are likely to be good for others, in which actions are morally right to the extent that they honour the capacity to relate communally, reduce discord or promote friendly relationships with others, and in which the physical world and the spiritual world are fundamentally united. Conclusion. Scholars, health professionals, policy makers and others should be aware that an alternative ethical theory exists in the global South that may be applied to address a variety of global (bio)ethical issues. Further research, however, is needed to evaluate how properly action-guiding this formulation is in particular contexts.",

The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in big data analytics (BDA) technologies have provided an open opportunity to develop highly needed disaster resilient smart city environments. In this paper, we propose and discuss the novel reference architecture and philosophy of a disaster resilient smart city (DRSC) through the integration of the IoT and BDA technologies. The proposed architecture offers a generic solution for disaster management activities in smart city incentives. A combination of the Hadoop Ecosystem and Spark are reviewed to develop an efficient DRSC environment that supports both real-time and offline analysis. The implementation model of the environment consists of data harvesting, data aggregation, data pre-processing, and big data analytics and service platform. A variety of datasets (i.e., smart buildings, city pollution, traffic simulator, and twitter) are utilized for the validation and evaluation of the system to detect and generate alerts for a fire in a building, pollution level in the city, emergency evacuation path, and the collection of information about natural disasters (i.e., earthquakes and tsunamis). The evaluation of the system efficiency is measured in terms of processing time and throughput that demonstrates the performance superiority of the proposed architecture. Moreover, the key challenges faced are identified and briefly discussed. <h2>Other Information</h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Published in: IEEE Access<br>License: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br>See article on publisher's website: <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2019.2928233\" target=\"_blank\">https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2019.2928233</a>",

As a result, the work that has been done on joy is disjointed, and frequently does not build on the previous literature; indeed, the various definitions of joy that psychologists use often conflict with one another. The present article, therefore, seeks to address this gap in the positive psychology literature and provide suggestions for future directions, by placing the existing psychological work on joy in dialogue with itself and also in dialogue with the work on joy done in other fields, including, theology and religious studies, philosophy, and literature. The first part of this paper provides a systematic review of the existing work on joy and aims to develop an overarching framework that can be used to operationalize and define joy. This paper will then provide some suggestions for future directions for psychological research into joy, and will close by suggesting reasons why joy is an important phenomenon toward which positive psychology should turn its focus.",

Environmental aesthetics has emerged in the last 50 years from the philosophical fields of aesthetics and environmental philosophy. Other disciplinary perspectives have also shaped environmental aesthetics, including landscape architecture, human geography, restoration ecology and empirical studies on landscape preferences in developmental and environmental psychology. This review and synthesis mainly addresses the theoretical approaches and concepts that provide a framework to the key debates in the field, but also considers how empirical approaches have shaped recent developments, and how conceptual issues arise with respect to empirical cases. We outline the background and context of environmental aesthetics, its key concepts, and provide a critical review of contemporary theories in the field. We then consider how aesthetics features in issues pertaining to the conservation, preservation, and restoration of nature. Finally, we identify some new directions for environmental aesthetics scholarship that can productively contribute to ongoing debates regarding various relationships between people and nature.
