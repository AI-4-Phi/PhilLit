DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the ethics of citation practices through the lens of epistemic injustice. Miranda Fricker's 2007 foundational work identified testimonial and hermeneutical injustice as distinctively epistemic wrongs that harm people in their capacity as knowers. Testimonial injustice occurs when prejudice causes a speaker to receive deflated credibility; hermeneutical injustice arises when marginalized groups lack collective conceptual resources to articulate their experiences. This framework has been extensively applied and critiqued, with Kristie Dotson expanding it to include contributory injustice (when marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to collective hermeneutical resources) and epistemic violence (systematic silencing). Jos\u00e9 Medina's work develops the notion of epistemic resistance and the collective dimensions of epistemic oppression.

The domain specifically addresses how citational practices perpetuate or resist these injustices. Citation functions as a form of testimonial recognition: who gets cited, whose work is rendered invisible, and whose perspectives are marginalized in scholarly knowledge production all reflect and reinforce broader patterns of epistemic injustice. Recent work explores citational justice as a subspecies of testimonial justice, examining how gender, race, geography, and institutional prestige shape citation networks in philosophy. Empirical studies document systematic citation bias, while normative work debates scholars' ethical obligations in citation practices and whether social justice considerations should influence bibliographic selection.

Key debates include: whether citational justice demands demographic representation or substantive engagement with marginalized perspectives; whether "strategic" citation for social justice reasons constitutes ethically bad epistemic practice; how to balance epistemic and ethical considerations in citation; and whether literature reviews themselves can instantiate epistemic injustice through exclusionary citational practices.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is central to the metaphilosophical inquiry into literature review methodology and ethics. Literature reviews are constituted through citational choices—every bibliography embodies decisions about whose testimony to include, amplify, or omit. The epistemic injustice framework illuminates how ostensibly neutral methodological practices (comprehensiveness, relevance criteria, quality standards) can systematically exclude marginalized voices while claiming objectivity. The domain provides conceptual tools to analyze whether and how literature reviews perpetuate testimonial and hermeneutical injustice, and what citational justice would require of reviewers.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical work directly addresses citation ethics in literature reviews specifically (most work focuses on citation generally). Few papers engage with the tension between epistemic rigor and social justice in bibliographic selection. The relationship between citational justice and other forms of epistemic justice (interpretive, hermeneutical) in review contexts remains under-theorized. Five entries (Dotson 2012, Medina 2012, Bruton 2023, Fricker 2010, Taswell 2022) lack abstracts and are marked INCOMPLETE; synthesis agents should prioritize the 13 entries with full abstracts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Begin with Fricker's foundational framework and Dotson's expansions. Examine how testimonial/hermeneutical injustice manifests in citational practices. Consider Medina's work on epistemic resistance as relevant to counter-practices. Address the nascent discussion of citational justice explicitly. Connect to broader debates about diversity, decolonization, and epistemic pluralism in philosophy. Emphasize that this is an emerging area—many questions remain open.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Fricker's virtue epistemology approach: 5 papers - Testimonial injustice as credibility deficit; virtue of testimonial justice as corrective
- Dotson's structural/oppression framework: 4 papers - Epistemic violence, contributory injustice; virtue insufficient, structural change needed
- Citational justice as justice issue: 3 papers - Citation as form of epistemic recognition; ethical obligations in citation practices
- Critical/decolonial approaches: 4 papers - Global North/South epistemic injustice; decolonizing knowledge production
- Skeptical/cautionary: 2 papers - Risks of politicizing citation; epistemic costs of identity-based inclusion

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the concept of epistemic injustice, identifying two forms: testimonial injustice (when identity prejudice causes deflated credibility judgments) and hermeneutical injustice (when gaps in collective interpretive resources disadvantage marginalized groups in understanding their experiences). Argues these wrongs are distinctively epistemic—harming people specifically in their capacity as knowers—and proposes testimonial justice as an epistemic virtue to counteract them.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational work establishing the framework used throughout this domain. Directly relevant to literature review ethics because citational practices involve credibility judgments about whose testimony (scholarship) deserves inclusion and attention. The testimonial injustice concept illuminates how prejudice-driven exclusion from bibliographies wrongs authors as epistemic agents. The hermeneutical dimension addresses how marginalized perspectives may lack recognition as legitimate knowledge contributions.

  POSITION: Virtue epistemology approach emphasizing individual epistemic virtues as corrective. Positions epistemic injustice as simultaneously ethical and epistemic wrong, requiring reflexive critical awareness from hearers/citers.

  abstract = {Abstract Justice is one of the oldest and most central themes of philosophy, but sometimes we would do well to focus instead on injustice. In epistemology, the very idea that there is a first-order ethical dimension to our epistemic practices — the idea that there is such a thing as epistemic justice — remains obscure until we adjust the philosophical lens so that we see through to the negative space that is epistemic injustice. This book argues that there is a distinctively epistemic genus of injustice, in which someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower, wronged therefore in a capacity essential to human value. The book identifies two forms of epistemic injustice: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. In doing so, it charts the ethical dimension of two fundamental epistemic practices: gaining knowledge by being told and making sense of our social experiences. As the account unfolds, the book travels through a range of philosophical problems. Thus, the book finds an analysis of social power; an account of prejudicial stereotypes; a characterization of two hybrid intellectual-ethical virtues; a revised account of the State of Nature used in genealogical explanations of the concept of knowledge; a discussion of objectification and ‘silencing’; and a framework for a virtue epistemological account of testimony. The book reveals epistemic injustice as a potent yet largely silent dimension of discrimination, analyses the wrong it perpetrates, and constructs two hybrid ethical-intellectual virtues of epistemic justice which aim to forestall it.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a three-tiered account of epistemic oppression: first-order (testimonial quieting/smothering), second-order (failure of epistemic uptake), and third-order (inadequate hermeneutical resources). Argues Fricker's framework insufficiently captures structural/systematic dimensions of epistemic harm. Emphasizes that epistemic oppression operates at group level through "irreducibly reliable" patterns that cannot be addressed through individual virtue alone.

  RELEVANCE: Expands Fricker's framework to emphasize structural dimensions directly relevant to understanding how literature review practices systematically exclude marginalized scholarship. The concept of contributory injustice (preventing marginalized knowers from contributing to collective epistemic resources) directly applies to citational gatekeeping. Shifts focus from individual prejudice to systematic patterns in scholarly knowledge production.

  POSITION: Structural/oppression framework emphasizing that epistemic injustice requires institutional/collective remedies beyond individual virtue. Critical of approaches that individualize responsibility for systemic exclusion.

  abstract = {AbstractEpistemic oppression refers to persistent epistemic exclusion that hinders one’s contribution to knowledge production. The tendency to shy away from using the term “epistemic oppression” may follow from an assumption that epistemic forms of oppression are generally reducible to social and political forms of oppression. While I agree that many exclusions that compromise one’s ability to contribute to the production of knowledge can be reducible to social and political forms of oppression, there still exists distinctly irreducible forms of epistemic oppression. In this paper, I claim that a major point of distinction between reducible and irreducible epistemic oppression is the major source of difficulty one faces in addressing each kind of oppression, i.e. epistemic power or features of epistemological systems. Distinguishing between reducible and irreducible forms of epistemic oppression can offer a better understanding of what is at stake in deploying the term and when such deployment is apt.Keywords: Epistemic OppressionEpistemic ExclusionEpistemological ResilienceEpistemic PowerEpistemological Systems Notes[1] This definition of epistemic exclusion relies heavily on Irene Omolola’s use of the term (see Adadevoh 2011).[2] My definition of epistemic agency is heavily influenced by Cynthia Townley’s definition (see Townley 2003, 109–110).[3] I use Plato’s Allegory very deliberately here. The allegorical imagery of Plato’s Allegory facilitates an acknowledgement of the three features of our epistemic landscape, that is, situatedness, interdependence and resilience, which I will use to illustrate different epistemic exclusions. It also serves the goals of this paper. I am not concerned here with establishing new forms of epistemic oppression or that epistemic oppression exists. If I held these goals, then utilizing the imagery in Plato’s Allegory would be inappropriate. Rather, my objective is to highlight the possibility of pulling apart reducible and irreducible epistemic oppression. As such, I do not use “real life” examples mainly because my focus is not to demonstrate the actual existence of epistemic oppression itself. Rather, mine is a pursuit of an adequate conceptualization of epistemic oppression. For articles that highlight the existence of epistemic oppression (see Code 1995; Collins 1989; Fricker 1998, 2007; Harding 1986; Langton 2000; Mills 1999). Hence, this analysis is an inquiry into conceptual approaches that can illuminate the existence of epistemic oppression and not an attempt to locate epistemic oppression on the ground.[4] This is not to say all organizational schemata are intentionally decided upon. To say that organizational schemata are intentionally collective is to gesture to the fact that collectives can and do come together according to shared aims, values and/or beliefs for the sake of furthering those aims, values, and/or beliefs. Organizational schemata will, then, develop both inside and outside of these goals thereby creating increasingly complex social-collective schemata.[5] There may be some pause over the focus on effectiveness in this approach to organizational change. However, epistemic affairs, as I understand them, are a normative affairs. Knowing well (internal justification) and accurately (external justification) is often the goal of epistemological investigations. I take this to be a kind of effectiveness.[6] It is important to note, again, that I am not borrowing the insight Plato draws from his Allegory. Rather I am appropriating the imagery for the sake of my attempt to conceptualize epistemic oppression. Hence, my use of the Allegory may diverge starkly from Plato’s positions.[7] Epistemic exclusion is not synonymous with epistemic oppression. Recall, I defined epistemic oppression according to persisting exclusion. Hence, establishing the existence of an epistemic exclusion is only one aspect of establishing the presence of epistemic oppression. One must also demonstrate the persistence of the exclusion.[8] Some would argue that even this kind of search would most likely prove ineffective. For example, Mariana Ortega carefully details how the search for the kinds of experiences that lead to epistemic friction can often lead to “being knowingly, lovingly ignorant,” another recalcitrant form of ignorance (Ortega 2006).[9] To be clear, though Plato would go on to postulate an “outside” of the cave, where access to things-in-themselves resides. I am in no way committed to the idea that there is an outside of the allegorical cave setting Plato creates. In fact, it may well be the case that, as many suggest, there is no outside of our social worlds, where knowledge lies. Regardless of how one resolves the question of knowledge and perspective, there is, however, an outside to one’s own perspective that is often held by other knowers. Hence, the “outside,” in the allegory I am building, points to epistemically different perspectives, that is, mobile vs. fettered persons.[10] This extension of the Allegory is heavily influenced by Nancy Tuana’s articulation of the creation of “epistemically damaged identities,” Patricia Hill Collins’ analysis of the suppression of black feminist thought and Miranda Fricker’s paradigm case of testimonial injustice (see Collins 1989; Fricker 2007; Tuana 2006).[11] I use the phrase “default credibility level” because it does not denote an automatic credibility conferral, but rather a general propensity to give positive credibility assessments.[12] For an account that develops this well, see Medina 2011. Tuana cites the lower credibility given to victims of incest as an example of the “construction of an epistemically disadvantaged identity.” She explains: “Victims of incest are often judged as not being epistemically credible because they are constructed as being suggestible, gullible, or vengeful. Their testimony is discredited; their memories are questioned. In instances such as these, it is not simply facts, events, practices, or technologies that are rendered not known, but individuals and groups who are rendered ‘not knowers.’ They are constructed as untrustworthy.” (2006, 13). In cases where entire groups suffer prejudices that compromise their ability to appear credible, for example, these groups experience epistemic exclusion insofar as their ability to participate in knowledge production is compromised. Their language skills become moot. Their ability to access shared images and metaphors for communicating their experience is lessened considerably. In other words, populations with epistemically disadvantaged identities have a reduced ability to utilize persuasively shared epistemic resources.[13] Miranda Fricker, in her book, Epistemic Injustice, calls the routine deflation of a given groups credibility, testimonial injustice. She writes, testimonial injustice “occurs when prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker’s word” (Fricker 2007, 1). Fricker’s epistemic injustice is a species of epistemic oppression. Insofar as testimonial injustice involves persistent epistemic exclusion that compromises epistemic agency, it is a kind of epistemic oppression. Hence, the concept of epistemic oppression is an umbrella term for multiple ideas of how knowledge production can routinely harm some people and/or populations. Elsewhere I have explored Fricker’s concept of epistemic injustice using my understanding of epistemic oppression. (see Dotson 2012).[14] I borrow this term from Fricker (2007, 17).[15] There are many examples of this kind of epistemic exclusion (see e.g. Code 1995; Collins 2000; Fricker 2007; Williams 1991). For an extended example, see the Rigoberta Menchú controversy (Arias 2001).[16] It is important to note that “minimal” here does not denote “easy” or “adequate.” It is most likely the case, as is the case with Fricker’s testimonial injustice, the changes required to address first-order exclusions are quite extensive (For an account illustrating this, see Langton 2010). However, it is unclear that one needs to abandon the value placed on credibility in order to address the creation of epistemically disadvantaged identities via credibility deficits. I imply this conclusion in my article, “A Cautionary Tale” (2012).[17] For an extended example of the difficulty of the backlash such endeavors invoke see the Rigoberta Menchú controversy (Arias 2001).[18] The additions made to the Allegory are heavily influenced by Fricker’s paradigm case of hermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007).[19] Fricker’s example of hermeneutical injustice concerned the events leading to the creation of the term “sexual harassment,” where experiences with sexual harassment predated the term itself to the detriment of the victims. Many deny the prevalence of this kind of exclusion. They claim that it presumes that at any given time there is but one set of epistemic resources (Mason 2011). However, even if one were to take the reality of alternative epistemologies and epistemic resources into consideration, communicating with those not fluent in those alternative epistemic resources can still foster second-order epistemic exclusion.[20] See, for example (Anzaldúa 1999; Dotson 2011; duCille 2009; Lugones and Spelman 1983).[21] These extensions are influenced by Lorraine Code’s concept of rhetorical space and my concept of contributory injustice (see Code 1995; Dotson 2012).[22] There is a budding debate concerning whether Fricker’s hermeneutical injustice, which I have identified as an example of a second order epistemic injustice, affects all involved knowers equally (see Beeby 2011; Medina 2012).[23] For a good example of similar epistemic ramifications of such clashes (see Bergin 2001).Additional informationNotes on contributorsKristie DotsonKristie Dotson is an assistant professor of Philosophy at Michigan State University.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the concept of contributory injustice—a form of epistemic injustice where marginalized knowers are prevented from contributing to shared hermeneutical resources due to willfully ignorant audiences who refuse to acknowledge gaps in collective understanding. Distinguished from Fricker's hermeneutical injustice by emphasizing active exclusion rather than passive absence of concepts. Uses example of academic philosophy's marginalization of certain knowers and knowledge forms.

  RELEVANCE: Contributory injustice directly implicates literature review and citation practices: when reviewers systematically exclude work from marginalized scholars or alternative epistemologies, they enact this injustice. The paper's focus on academic philosophy makes it particularly relevant to understanding citational gatekeeping. The concept of "willful hermeneutical ignorance" applies to reviewers who claim comprehensiveness while excluding marginalized perspectives.

  POSITION: Critical expansion of Fricker emphasizing active dimensions of exclusion. Argues that simply lacking conceptual resources (Fricker's hermeneutical injustice) doesn't capture cases where dominant groups actively prevent marginalized contributions.

  year = {2012},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops an account of epistemic injustice emphasizing both oppression and resistance. Argues for "active ignorance" and "meta-ignorance" (ignorance of one's ignorance) as key mechanisms of epistemic injustice. Introduces notion of epistemic friction—productive disagreement that challenges epistemic complacency—and insensitivity/arrogance as epistemic vices. Emphasizes collective dimensions of both epistemic vice and virtue, advocating kaleidoscopic social consciousness recognizing multiple perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant to literature review ethics through concepts of active ignorance (reviewers who claim comprehensiveness while ignoring marginalized work) and meta-ignorance (unawareness of one's blind spots). The emphasis on epistemic friction suggests literature reviews should not merely compile agreement but engage productively with marginalized challenges to dominant paradigms. The notion of epistemic arrogance applies to reviewers who assume their perspective is comprehensive or neutral.

  POSITION: Combines virtue epistemology with critical race/feminist theory. Emphasizes resistance, agency, and imagination alongside critique of injustice. Advocates for pluralistic, polyphonic approaches to knowledge that resist epistemic closure.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Documents systematic epistemic injustice in global health bioethics through empirical analysis of knowledge production patterns. Shows Global South epistemologies, theories, and experiences are silenced through three mechanisms: who produces knowledge (predominantly Global North institutions/scholars), what theories are applied (Western philosophical frameworks presented as universal), and whose voices are sought (Global South populations studied but not consulted as epistemic authorities). Proposes comprehensive remedies emphasizing structural change, not just inclusion.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates how citational and bibliographic practices instantiate epistemic injustice at institutional level. Directly addresses literature review methodology by showing how dominant review practices systematically exclude Global South knowledge while claiming universality. The three-layer analysis (knowledge producers, theories applied, voices sought) provides framework for analyzing bias in literature reviews. Particularly relevant for understanding citational justice as requiring not just demographic inclusion but substantive engagement with alternative epistemologies.

  POSITION: Decolonial framework combining epistemic justice theory with empirical analysis. Emphasizes structural/institutional dimensions of injustice requiring systemic remedies (not individual virtue). Advocates epistemic pluralism and cognitive justice.

  abstract = {The silencing of the epistemologies, theories, principles, values, concepts and experiences of the global South constitutes a particularly egregious epistemic injustice in bioethics. Our shared responsibility to rectify that injustice should be at the top of the ethics agenda. That it is not, or only is in part, is deeply problematic and endangers the credibility of the entire field. As a first step towards reorienting the field, this paper offers a comprehensive account of epistemic justice for global health ethics. We first introduce several different conceptions of justice and decolonisation in relation to knowledge, purposefully drawing on work emanating from the global South as well as the global North. We then apply those conceptions to the global health ethics context to generate a tripartite account of the layers of epistemic justice in the field: who is producing ethics knowledge; what theories and concepts are being applied to produce ethics knowledge; and whose voices are sought, recorded and used to generate ethics knowledge. These layers reflect that the field spans conceptual and empirical research. We conclude by proposing that, going forward, three avenues are key to achieve greater epistemic justice at each layer and to help decolonise global health ethics: namely, understanding the problem, dialogue and structural change.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic review of journal publications (1947-2023) analyzing epistemic inclusivity through six varieties of epistemic justice framework. Identifies citational justice as essential facet of testimonial justice. Shows how citational practices in academic journals reflect and perpetuate epistemic exclusion. Argues for decolonizing knowledge through attention to hermeneutical justice, testimonial justice, interpretive burden, and metalinguistic awareness. Citational justice emerges as critical mechanism for recognizing marginalized epistemic contributions.

  RELEVANCE: Rare paper explicitly connecting citation practices to epistemic justice framework. Provides empirical demonstration of how citational patterns in journals constitute epistemic injustice. The systematic review methodology offers model for analyzing citational justice/injustice. Directly relevant to literature review ethics by showing citational choices as sites of potential injustice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Empirical survey study identifying three categories of ethically questionable citation behaviors: strategic citations (citing for personal advantage), neglectful citations (failing to cite due to bias/carelessness), and blind citations (citing without reading). Finds that greater experience does not necessarily improve citation practices. Particularly divisive issue: intentionally citing authors from underrepresented demographic groups for social justice reasons. Many respondents viewed this as ethically questionable, revealing tension between epistemic and social justice considerations in citation.

  RELEVANCE: Rare empirical study of citation ethics revealing actual norms and controversies among scholars. The finding that social justice-motivated citation is controversial illuminates key tension for literature review ethics: does citational justice require demographic-based inclusion, or does this constitute "strategic" citation? The three-category framework (strategic, neglectful, blind) could be applied to analyzing citation practices in literature reviews. Shows citation ethics is contested terrain, not settled practice.

  POSITION: Empirical/descriptive rather than normative, but reveals deep disagreements about whether social justice considerations legitimately inform citation. The controversy over demographic-based citation reveals tensions between traditional epistemic norms and citational justice demands.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes that when ethicists face credible allegations of professional sexual misconduct, scholars should cite their work alongside impartial information about allegations rather than either disengaging or proceeding as usual. Argues ethicists are distinct because their power is reproduced through citations, giving scholars moral and intellectual responsibility in citational practices. Suggests citational practice can function as accountability mechanism when institutional justice fails.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses ethics of citation as more than epistemic recognition—citation confers power and authority. Relevant to literature review ethics because it treats citation as morally significant act with consequences beyond knowledge transmission. The argument that scholars have "moral and intellectual responsibility" in citation practices supports viewing citational choices as ethically loaded. The focus on power reproduced through citations illuminates stakes of citational justice/injustice.

 In this article, we explore how to engage with the work of ethicists facing public allegations of professional sexual misconduct. Rather than disengaging or proceeding as usual, we propose citing their work alongside impartial information about credible allegations. We choose to isolate the work of ethicists as the target of this proposal because ethicists are distinct on two fronts: they are distinct among philosophers because they have moral authority, and distinct among others with moral authority, such as religious leaders and civil rights activists, because their power is reproduced in part through citations. Our approach offers a nuanced perspective on the power conferred through citations. We argue that individual scholars have a moral and intellectual responsibility to cite using this practice, especially when institutional enforcement of justice is lacking.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fricker responds to criticisms of her 2007 framework. Addresses questions about relationship between epistemic and ethical dimensions of epistemic injustice, whether virtue ethics approach is sufficient, and scope of testimonial injustice concept. Defends that epistemic injustice is distinctively epistemic (not reducible to ethical wrong) while acknowledging ethical and epistemic are inseparable. Clarifies that testimonial justice virtue requires more than absence of prejudice—requires active, critical reflection.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals debates and refinements around foundational framework. Fricker's defense of distinctively epistemic character of epistemic injustice is relevant to whether citational exclusion constitutes epistemic wrong or merely ethical failing. Her emphasis on active critical reflection (not just passive absence of bias) suggests citational justice requires reflexive examination of one's bibliographic choices. The engagement with critics shows epistemic injustice framework is contested, not settled doctrine.

  POSITION: Defense and clarification of virtue epistemology approach. Maintains that individual epistemic virtues are central to addressing epistemic injustice while acknowledging structural dimensions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends Fricker's framework by arguing credibility excess (not just deficit) can constitute testimonial injustice. When speakers from marginalized groups are assigned excess credibility on identity-related topics (as "spokespersons" for their group), this wrongfully reduces them to their identity and burdens them with representational labor. Discusses three patterns: typecasting (assumption that identity determines perspective), tokenism (exceptional individual treated as representative), and spokesperson burden (expectation to speak for entire group). All harm speakers as individual knowers.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant to citation practices and literature review ethics. Shows that simply increasing citation of marginalized scholars can perpetuate injustice if done in identity-reductive ways (citing women only on gender, scholars of color only on race, etc.). Illuminates how "diversity" in bibliographies can still enact epistemic injustice if it tokenizes or typecast authors. Suggests citational justice requires recognizing scholars as individuals with diverse expertise, not merely as group representatives.

  POSITION: Expansion of Fricker's framework. Argues testimonial injustice is broader than credibility deficit. Maintains focus on individual harms while addressing group-level patterns.

In this article, I argue that this restricted characterization of testimonial injustice is too narrow. I introduce a type of identity‐prejudicial credibility excess that harms its targets qua knowers and transmitters of knowledge. I show how positive stereotyping and prejudicially inflated credibility assessments contribute to the continued epistemic oppression of marginalized knowers. In particular, I examine harms such as typecasting, compulsory representation, and epistemic exploitation and consider what hearers are obligated to do in response to these injustices. I argue that because epistemic harms to marginalized knowers also arise from prejudicially inflated assessments of their credibility, the virtue of testimonial justice must be revised to remedy them.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques Fricker's claim that primary harm of testimonial injustice is epistemic objectification (treating speaker as mere object/informant rather than knower). Argues primary harm is better understood as derivatization—treating someone as derived/dependent rather than autonomous epistemic agent. Emphasizes that testimonial exchanges are mutual, requiring active participation from both speaker and hearer; derivatization violates this mutuality by denying speaker's epistemic agency and autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to understanding how citational practices can wrong authors as epistemic agents. If citing someone's work while systematically misrepresenting or decontextualizing it treats them as mere information source (objectification), or if citing only to critique without genuine engagement denies their autonomous epistemic standing (derivatization), this constitutes testimonial injustice. The emphasis on mutuality suggests literature reviews must engage work cited, not merely extract from it.

  POSITION: Feminist epistemology emphasizing relationality and mutual epistemic engagement. Critical refinement of Fricker's objectification account while maintaining focus on epistemic agency.

I first analyze Fricker's account of the harm, which she posits in terms of a subject/object relation as "epistemic objectification." My analysis, however, shows that (1) testimonial injustice does not render its victim to an object-like status and (2) testimonial injustice necessarily treats its victim as a subject, albeit a truncated subject. Drawing on the work of Ann Cahill and Simone de Beauvoir, I demonstrate that the primary harm of testimonial injustice is more aptly described in terms of a subject/other relation, or a relation that circumscribes the subjectivity of its victim within the confines of the perpetrator's subjectivity. Using these conceptual resources to examine the primary epistemic harm of testimonial injustice not only avoids the problems I raise with the notion of epistemic objectification, but also greatly enhances our understanding of testimonial injustice, and consequently of what more epistemically just relations look like.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces "testimonial void"—when a speaker withholds epistemic materials from a hearer-to-be based on faulty assumption that hearer lacks capacity to use them epistemically. Unlike Dotson's testimonial smothering (speaker withholds due to anticipated prejudice from hearer), testimonial void involves speaker's own prejudice about hearer's epistemic capacities. This is a form of silencing where would-be knowers are denied access to testimony due to prejudice. Shows testimonial injustice can be enacted by speakers, not just hearers.

  RELEVANCE: Relevant to literature review practices when scholars withhold their work from certain venues/audiences based on prejudiced assumptions about those audiences' epistemic capacities (e.g., assuming certain scholars/communities cannot engage with sophisticated arguments). Also relevant to accessibility issues in academic writing—when scholars deliberately write inaccessibly based on faulty assumptions about who merits access to knowledge. Illuminates bidirectional nature of testimonial injustice in scholarly communication.

  POSITION: Extension of testimonial injustice framework. Shows speakers can also be wrongdoers in testimonial injustice (not only victims). Emphasizes epistemic trust and relational equality dimensions.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper, I characterize a new kind of testimonial injustice (TI), a phenomenon I call ‘testimonial void’ (TV), which involves a substantial extension of the limits of the original concept put forward by Miranda Fricker. TV occurs when a speaker withholds epistemic materials on the basis of an epistemically and ethically faulty assumption that a hearer-to-be lacks the capacity to do anything epistemically relevant with them. As in testimonial smothering (TS), testimony is not proffered owing to an anticipated failure of uptake. However, unlike in cases of TS, the anticipated failure of uptake in TV is due to prejudice on the speaker’s part. By comparing TV with other forms of TI, I show that TV shares TI’s conceptual structure and harms. I argue that TV: a) shows the speaker to be a potential wrongdoer, b) reveals that TI cannot be equated with biased credibility assessments, c) entails both an indirect yet extreme form of silencing and d) the failure to extend a kind of epistemic trust implied by the enjoyment of epistemic relational equality. In addition, I explore intricate cases in which TV interacts with TS, identifying smothered instances of TV, as well as non-culpable cases of TV.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Fricker's objectification account of testimonial injustice's primary harm against Pohlhaus's derivatization alternative. Argues that enriching conception of epistemic objectification (drawing on Martha Nussbaum's cluster analysis) better captures harms than othering/derivatization framework. Shows cases where epistemic agency is affirmed but credibility unjustly impugned can still be understood as objectification when using nuanced account. Maintains objectification framework while acknowledging othering may offer supplementary resources.

  RELEVANCE: Contributes to understanding what makes citational exclusion or misrepresentation a distinctive epistemic wrong. If primary harm is objectification (reducing author to mere information source, denying epistemic agency), this explains why proper citation requires genuine engagement—not just formal attribution. Suggests citational justice requires recognizing cited authors as epistemic agents with autonomous contributions, not mere sources to extract from.

  abstract = {This paper re-examines the debate between those who, with Miranda Fricker, diagnose the primary, non-contingent harm of testimonial injustice as a kind of epistemic objectification and those who contend it is better thought of as a kind of epistemic othering. Defenders of the othering account of the primary harm have often argued for it by presenting cases of testimonial injustice in which the testifier’s epistemic agency is affirmed rather than denied, even while their credibility is unjustly impugned. In previous work, I have instead argued that such cases suggest that we need to enrich our conception of epistemic objectification in ways encouraged by Martha Nussbaum’s cluster analysis of objectification. Here I continue to make the case for this approach, and I consider the othering account in more detail. I focus in particular on Gaile Pohlhaus Jr.’s arguments for a version of the othering account in terms of the notion of derivatization, which turns on the idea that only such an account can enable us to properly understand the harms of testimonial injustice, in particular the ways in which it interferes with a subject’s epistemic agency and autonomy, and I’ll argue that such arguments should not sway us. Finally, I’ll further support my contention that it is illuminating and helpful to think of the primary harm of testimonial injustice in terms of epistemic objectification, though I will concede that the notion of epistemic othering may offer further helpful resources for understanding how subjects can be harmed by testimonial injustice.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Pratt and de Vries's account of epistemic justice, probing nuances of "inclusion" as remedy for epistemic injustice. Questions whether inclusion should operate within binary North/South vocabulary, whether inclusion can paradoxically produce exclusion (through tokenism or elite capture), and whether inclusion as "politics of belonging" creates new epistemic harms through authenticity demands. Warns that increasing representation without transforming underlying epistemic structures may create appearance of inclusion while leaving exclusion intact (internal exclusion).

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis directly relevant to debates about citational justice and diversity in literature reviews. Warns that simply including more scholars from Global South (or other marginalized groups) may not achieve epistemic justice if underlying power structures remain. The concept of "internal exclusion" (being formally included but substantively marginalized) applies to tokenistic citation practices. Elite capture warning relevant to concerns about who gets to represent marginalized perspectives in bibliographies.

  POSITION: Postcolonial/decolonial critique of liberal inclusion approaches. Emphasizes need for structural transformation, not just numerical representation. Skeptical of whether epistemic justice can be achieved through inclusion within existing frameworks.

  abstract = {Bridget Pratt and Jantina de Vries have made an insightful contribution to enhancing epistemic justice in global health ethics. Their elaboration details intellectual (external) exclusion— described as nonrepresentation—across three levels, and at its core, proposes inclusion to rectify this. To extend this work, we contend that it is worth probing the nuances and challenges associated with inclusion as a response to epistemic injustice. These include (A) the meaning of inclusion outside binary vocabularies of north and south; (B) the possibility of forms of inclusion that produce exclusion and (C) inclusion as a politics of belonging with intellectual confinement as a possible epistemic harm. How the problem of injustice is described influences the substantive meaning of inclusion. In describing epistemic injustice, north and south (centre and periphery) are used as relational markers of power, inclusion, authority and exclusion. While this binary vocabulary is seductive, it can appear to confer proprietary rights to the concepts, theories and values described as originating in the global north (and south). However, such inscriptions of ownership are not always a correct reading of the problem. Sometimes, the ostensible westernness and nonwesternness of ideas are taken for granted, particularly when histories of connection and exchange go unacknowledged. Even if we grant that an idea has its geodiscursive origin in the global north, there is the separate issue of whether it is ever fully constituted in this epistemic location. Therefore, while Pratt and de Vries are right to seek the representation of voices and debates that position themselves as southern, epistemic justice can also entail abandoning the presumption of discrete intellectual traditions by illuminating histories of interaction, exchange and connection, although in unequal encounters. This frames inclusion as an effort in reclamation and appropriation, inscribing Africa and the global south in the genealogy and intellectual history of ideas routinely taken for granted as northern. A second set of issues relates to whether including scholarship from the global south necessarily means that these perspectives are more heard. Sometimes, inclusion can be an instrument of exclusion, a way of (un)consciously weakening the radical claims being pursued. This erosion can occur through internal exclusion, which is the experience of exclusion by individuals positioned as included/represented. This shows that exclusion and inclusion are not always binaries. Increasing visibility through representation of previously excluded knowers and knowledge systems that fit the social descriptions of prime targets for inclusion may enhance optics but direct attention away from the phenomenon of exclusion itself. To consolidate inclusion that matters, internal exclusion should be central to an understanding of exclusion. In order to mitigate the appearance of inclusion, it is important to scrutinise, for example, the language of ‘standards’ and associated processes of establishing epistemic authority, as sites of internal exclusion. Although we lack the space to provide details, this more transformative inclusion regards the epistemologies that are accounted for in the construction of what is meaningful in global health ethics. In addition to which priorities are favoured and by whom, the inclusion that matters involves unravelling the politics of knowledge (production and conversion), particularly in relation to how standards are (re) influenced, (re)developed, (re)validated and fed into the priorities and discourses constitutive of global health ethics. Rather than an exhaustive statement on what constitutes inclusive practices, Pratt and de Vries’ contribution should be taken as impetus to think and rethink inclusion and epistemic justice. The denuding of inclusion can also occur through elite capture, which is ‘the control over the political agendas and resources by a group’s most advantaged people.’ Elite capture points to the possibility that those likely to be included/ deferred to are insufficiently representative of the material conditions and intellectual concerns of the locations they are expected to represent. More cynically, outcomes like elite capture render grammars of inclusion, like epistemic justice, as nothing more than campaigns for parochial power and esteem. Pratt and de Vries do pay some attention to this by effectively outlining epistemic justice as having beneficiaries outside academic elites. As such, epistemic justice would need to be seen as an ongoing commitment to being accountable and responsive to those who are not yet in the room by deliberately cultivating the ‘practical and material bases for popular power over knowledge production and distribution.’ Finally, it is worth paying attention to the politics of belonging that often accompanies the pursuit of inclusion. On a practical level, including voices and perspectives from the global south means making political and ethical judgements about what counts as knowledge from the global south and who qualifies for recognition as African/southern. This means generating values by which membership is judged, such that a key issue becomes the very boundedness of a particular epistemic location. Do these values broaden or constrict the canvass on which southern/ African ideas are painted? Do they constrain or expand the possibilities for negotiating inclusion? While Pratt and de Vries foreground the question of ‘where is knowledge from the global south’, the equally salient question of who/what is recognised as southern lurks around the corner. The political nature of belonging is evident, for example, in the suggestion that one may be from the south geographically but not intellectually. An interest in voices that think from a southern/African location, we imagine, would involve generating criteria of what those voices sound like, and this is inevitably a normative project. With this comes the possibility of an altogether new epistemic harm within the talk of inclusion, whereby expectations of authenticity work to enclose and confine southern scholars within a narrow set of themes, concepts, debates and intellectual traditions.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Kevin Kumashiro's argument that transformative anti-oppressive education requires altering harmful citational practices. Identifies two shortcomings: high discursive literacy prerequisite, and risk of conflating honest mistakes with willful ignorance, leading to polarization. Proposes applying epistemic injustice framework to grant nuanced credit to speakers' intentions, potentially mitigating polarization. Argues attention to outcome (impact) and intention should not be oppositional—both perspectives can inform each other.

 It is a common contention that education done uncritically and unreflectively may serve to sustain and justify the status quo, in terms of mechanisms of cultural or racial privileging and marginalization. This article explores an argument made from within anti-oppressive education theory and advocated by theorist Kevin Kumashiro, namely that transformative education must entail altering harmful citational practices. I see two shortcomings in relation to this argument: first, its focus on discursive practice entails a prerequisite of high discursive literacy. Second, it may lead to a failure to give credit to people’s intentions, risking a conflation of honest mistakes and wilful ignorance, and depriving us of theoretical nuance. While a well-argued and important call, I argue in this article that both shortcomings lead to the risk of a polarized conversation. Focusing on cultural, ethnic and racial categorization, and using social studies as an illustration, it is suggested that applying notions from the theoretical concept of epistemic injustice may open up a space for granting nuanced credit to people’s intentions, thereby mitigating the risk of polarization. Rather than viewing attention to outcome and attention to intention as oppositional to one another, it is argued that both theoretical perspectives may benefit from the insights of the other. By applying needed context-specificity and nuance to categorizations of dominance and marginalization in individual discursive exchange, this can be done without granting priority to the experience of dominantly situated knowers.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Brief commentary connecting epistemic injustice, open access publishing, and citational justice. Argues that paywalled scholarship perpetuates epistemic injustice by excluding scholars without institutional access from full participation in knowledge production. Suggests open access as mechanism for citational justice by enabling broader engagement with and citation of scholarship. Treats citation as form of epistemic participation requiring access to cited materials.

  RELEVANCE: Connects structural barriers (paywalls) to citational injustice. Relevant to literature review methodology: if reviewers have differential access to literature based on institutional resources, resulting bibliographies will systematically exclude work behind paywalls that reviewers cannot access. The open access argument suggests citational justice requires attending to structural access issues, not just representational concerns. Brief piece but makes important structural point.

We systematically curate the initial data to conduct a co-authorship and co-citation analysis with highly cited research outputs (n = 500) and a co-word analysis with most relevant research outputs (n = 1000). These bibliometric analyses result in multiple networked visualisations that map the status quo and the nature of current citational and collaborative practices among the experts, institutions and countries involved in global AI Ethics research. Using Sheila Jasanoff’s co-production theory as a conceptual lens, we analyse these findings and show that the experts from the Global North currently legitimise their expertise in AI Ethics through dynamic citational and collaborative practices in knowledge production within the field. Collectively, they shape the discourses and institutional ways of understanding around the ethical development of AI technologies worldwide. This techno-politics of knowledge-making in AI Ethics culminates in creating epistemic injustice for the Global South. Drawing from Miranda Fricker and prominent feminist and postcolonial theorists, we explain how such injustice is produced and distributed through patterned pathways of co-production of AI Ethics. Thus, we show that the global project of AI Ethics fails to deliver its promise to be universally useful by keeping the global majority populations in the Southern regions marginalized as ‘others’.},
