====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The literature on autonomy and self-determination is organized around several
competing theoretical approaches. The hierarchical model, originating with Harry
Frankfurt's seminal 1971 paper, grounds autonomy in the agent's hierarchical
structure of desires and second-order volitions. This approach has been extensively
developed and criticized, with debates over whether it adequately captures authentic
self-governance without infinite regress. The relational autonomy tradition, emerging
from feminist philosophy, challenges individualistic conceptions by emphasizing
that autonomy is socially constituted and develops through interpersonal relationships.
Key proponents like Mackenzie and Stoljar argue that autonomy requires not just
internal coherence but also enabling social conditions. Recent work has explored
autonomy in contexts of deference, delegation, and tool-use, with Michael Garnett's
analysis of practical deference as interpersonal rule being particularly relevant.
The literature also includes reasons-responsive theories and multidimensional
accounts that distinguish self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization
as distinct dimensions of autonomy.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational for understanding whether doing things yourself is
constitutive of autonomous agency or merely instrumental. The hierarchical theories
address whether outsourcing action to others compromises the authenticity of one's
will. Relational autonomy theories challenge the assumption that independence is
necessary for autonomy, potentially supporting delegation as compatible with
self-governance. Garnett's work on deference directly addresses when relying on
others' judgment undermines autonomy, which is central to DIY ethics.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on autonomy in medical contexts (informed consent,
end-of-life care) and political philosophy, there is surprisingly little direct
philosophical analysis of how tool-use, delegation, and outsourcing affect autonomy.
Most discussions of practical deference focus on moral or epistemic deference rather
than practical skill delegation. The relationship between autonomy and achievement
through one's own efforts remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should begin with Frankfurt's hierarchical model as the canonical
individualistic account, then contrast it with relational autonomy to show the
spectrum of views. Garnett's recent work provides a bridge to practical questions
about delegation. The key question for the project is whether autonomous action
requires that the agent be the one who performs the action, or whether autonomous
control over outcomes is sufficient even when means are delegated.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Hierarchical theories (Frankfurt, Bratman): 7 papers - Autonomy as alignment
  between higher-order and lower-order mental states
- Relational autonomy (Mackenzie, Stoljar, Westlund): 6 papers - Autonomy as
  socially constituted through interpersonal relationships
- Reasons-responsive theories (Fischer, Wallace): 2 papers - Autonomy as capacity
  to respond to reasons
- Multidimensional accounts (Killmister, Mackenzie): 3 papers - Autonomy as having

DOMAIN: Authenticity and Self-Authorship
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The authenticity literature divides into historical and contemporary strands. Historically, the concept emerged from Romantic expressivism and existentialist philosophy (Rousseau, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre), emphasizing self-discovery, genuine self-expression, and living in accord with one's deepest commitments. Contemporary analytic philosophy has reconstructed authenticity as a defensible ethical ideal while addressing critiques of narcissism and self-indulgence. Key debates center on: (1) essentialist vs. existentialist conceptions of the true self; (2) the relationship between authenticity and autonomy (are they distinct ideals or overlapping?); (3) whether authenticity requires self-transcendence through engagement with external values or can be purely self-referential; (4) the role of authenticity in grounding moral agency and self-authorship.

Recent work (Guignon 2004, Taylor 1991, Bauer 2021) reconstructs authenticity as requiring both inward self-reflection and outward engagement with shared horizons of value. This positions authenticity as a social virtue requiring commitment to sustaining democratic communities. Critics (Rodríguez Apólito 2022) argue procedural autonomy accounts should avoid authenticity requirements due to their potential to obscure oppression. The process/outcome distinction emerges in debates over moral testimony (Mogensen 2015), where authenticity grounds the value of forming moral beliefs oneself rather than deferring to others.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Authenticity theories directly address the value of doing things yourself versus having them done for you. If authenticity is valuable, then actions expressive of one's genuine commitments have special moral significance independent of their outcomes. This grounds a DIY ethic: self-authorship and genuine agency matter morally because they constitute authentic living. The existentialist emphasis on self-making through choice suggests the process of doing something oneself (rather than delegating) is constitutive of authentic selfhood. Contemporary accounts emphasizing self-transcendence also suggest limits: authenticity may require engaging with values beyond mere preference, constraining what counts as genuinely authentic action.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited contemporary work explicitly connecting authenticity to delegation, reliance on tools/technology, or the specific value of manual/personal effort. Most literature focuses on belief formation, identity, and social roles rather than practical activities. The distinction between doing something "oneself" and merely being causally responsible for an outcome is under-theorized in the authenticity literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the distinction between essentialist (discovery-based) and existentialist (self-making) authenticity, as these ground different views on DIY value. Highlight the tension between authenticity as inward-looking (genuine self-expression) versus requiring outward engagement (social horizons, shared values). Connect to moral testimony debates where process/outcome distinctions are explicit.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Existentialist authenticity (Sartre, Beauvoir, Heidegger): 6 papers - Authenticity as self-making through choice and engagement with existential conditions
- Contemporary reconstructions (Taylor, Guignon, Bauer): 5 papers - Authenticity as social virtue requiring self-transcendence

DOMAIN: Moral Responsibility and Agency  
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines theories of moral responsibility, control, and agency,
particularly as they relate to delegation and collaborative action. The literature
divides into several key debates: (1) The control condition debate, centered on
Fischer and Ravizza's guidance control versus regulative control requiring alternative
possibilities; (2) The reactive attitudes tradition following Strawson's seminal
paper, examining when blame and praise are appropriate; (3) Complicity and shared
responsibility, investigating how individuals bear responsibility for collective
outcomes; and (4) Recent applications to AI and technology, exploring responsibility
gaps when autonomous systems mediate action. Christopher Kutz's work on complicity
without causal contribution is particularly relevant to delegation, as is Bratman's
account of shared agency through interlocking intentions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The moral value of doing things yourself depends critically on whether delegating
tasks diminishes responsibility or merely distributes it. Fischer and Ravizza's
guidance control framework suggests responsibility tracks one's reasons-responsive
mechanism, not direct causal contribution. Kutz's complicity principle argues
participants share responsibility even when individual contributions are causally
inert. These debates directly address whether delegation compromises moral standing.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While extensive literature exists on collective responsibility and shared agency,
few papers directly examine the ethical significance of *choosing* to delegate
versus performing tasks oneself. The intrinsic value (not just instrumental
efficiency) of personal action remains under-explored. Recent AI ethics work
addresses responsibility gaps but focuses on accountability rather than the
moral significance of retaining agency. Jensen and Mellema are both missing abstracts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish between: (1) causal responsibility (making a difference), (2) moral
responsibility (eligibility for praise/blame), and (3) what we might call
"authorship" (the value of an outcome tracking to one's own agency). The DIY
project may concern the third category more than the first two.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Control-based theories: 6 papers - Responsibility requires appropriate control (guidance vs. regulative)
- Complicity theories: 4 papers - Participation generates responsibility independent of causal contribution
- Shared agency theories: 4 papers - Joint action through interlocking intentions and plural subjects
- Applied AI ethics: 4 papers - Responsibility gaps and distributed responsibility in technological systems

DOMAIN: The Ethics of Technology and Cognitive Offloading
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11
PAPERS_FOUND: 19 total (High: 5, Medium: 9, Low: 4, INCOMPLETE: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines philosophical debates about how technology shapes
human agency, cognition, and autonomy. The extended mind thesis (Clark
& Chalmers 1998) provides the foundational framework, arguing that
cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain into external tools and
artifacts. This raises questions about whether technological
augmentation diminishes or extends human capacities. Recent work
examines cognitive offloading—the delegation of cognitive tasks to
external devices—and its implications for intellectual virtue,
autonomy, and moral agency. A key debate concerns whether offloading
undermines cognitive skills and autonomy or merely reallocates mental
resources to more valuable tasks. Another strand examines how smart
technologies challenge traditional transparency ideals in tool use, and
how moral technologies might offload not just cognitive but also moral
tasks. The domain connects extended mind theory to practical questions
about digital assistants, smartphones, and AI-mediated decision-making.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is critical for distinguishing DIY from tool-assisted
action. If extended mind theory is correct, using tools doesn't
outsource tasks to something external—it extends the self. This
challenges the intuition that tool use differs fundamentally from human
delegation. The cognitive offloading literature addresses whether there
are morally relevant differences between using technology versus relying
on other people, particularly regarding autonomy and skill development.
Understanding how technology shapes agency clarifies what is lost or
gained when we delegate tasks to machines rather than doing them
ourselves.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most work focuses on cognitive and epistemic dimensions of offloading;
less attention to affective or embodied dimensions. Limited engagement
with how extended mind theory applies to collaborative tasks or
distributed agency. Few papers directly address the moral distinction
between tool use and interpersonal delegation. INCOMPLETE entries
(lacking abstracts): nagelReiner2018skillful (Frontiers in Psychology),
schultz2025natural (Synthese 2025), choi2021internet (unpublished
manuscript), chemero2009radical (book). These entries remain in the
bibliography for reference but are excluded from synthesis.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the debate between extended mind proponents and critics who
see offloading as diminishing agency. Distinguish cognitive offloading
(memory, calculation) from moral offloading (decision-making, judgment).
Consider how transparency and skillful use affect whether technology
extends or replaces the self.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Extended mind optimists (8 papers): Technology extends rather than replaces cognition
- Offloading skeptics (5 papers): Cognitive delegation threatens autonomy and skill
- Virtue epistemology critics (3 papers): Offloading undermines intellectual virtues
- Ethical technology designers (2 papers): Skillful use determines moral status

DOMAIN: Virtue Ethics and Character Development
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain explores whether virtues require direct action and skill acquisition
through practice. The central debate concerns the "skill model" of virtue, which
draws an analogy between moral virtues and practical skills like playing piano or
carpentry. Proponents (notably Julia Annas) argue that virtues develop through
repeated practice and deliberate cultivation, just as skills do. This view has
significant implications for understanding how self-reliance and doing things
yourself might be constitutive of virtue rather than merely instrumentally valuable.

However, the skill model faces substantial challenges. Critics argue that (1)
skills can be assessed by agent-independent standards while virtues arguably cannot
(Schuster 2023), (2) expert skills are "brittle" and domain-specific rather than
flexibly robust across contexts (Kilov 2023), and (3) the analogy fails to capture
the distinctively moral and affective dimensions of virtue. Recent work integrates
virtue acquisition with self-regulation theory (Krettenauer & Stichter 2023) and
explores how habituation shapes both conscious and non-conscious processes in
character development.

A related strand concerns practical wisdom (phronesis) as the master virtue that
guides when and how to act virtuously. Practical wisdom requires both intellectual
understanding and experiential knowledge gained through doing. Contemporary virtue
ethics emphasizes that phronesis cannot be fully taught but must be cultivated
through guided practice - suggesting a strong connection between virtuous character
and direct personal engagement with morally significant activities.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
If virtues are indeed skill-like and develop primarily through practice, then doing
things yourself would be constitutive of character excellence rather than merely
instrumentally valuable. The habituative model suggests that delegating important
activities might prevent the formation of virtuous dispositions. However, critics
of the skill model raise important questions about whether this analogy captures
what's distinctive about moral virtue.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very few papers directly address whether delegation or technological substitution
might impair virtue development. The literature focuses on skill acquisition
generally but rarely examines when self-performance vs delegation matters morally.
More work needed on how practical wisdom relates to decisions about when to do
things yourself vs rely on others or technology.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The debate over the skill model is crucial for the project. If the skill model is
correct, there are strong grounds for thinking DIY activity has constitutive moral
value. If critics are right that skills and virtues differ fundamentally, the case
for DIY weakens. Pay special attention to what makes practice essential for virtue
- is it the external performance or the internal cultivation of practical wisdom?

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Virtue-as-skill proponents (6 papers): Virtues develop like skills through
  practice and require active cultivation
- Skill model critics (3 papers): Virtues and skills differ in fundamental ways
  that undermine the analogy
- Phronesis-centered approaches (5 papers): Practical wisdom as master virtue
  requires experiential knowledge
- Habituation theorists (4 papers): Character develops through repeated action
  shaping both conscious and unconscious processes

DOMAIN: Relational Autonomy and Interdependence

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, IEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses feminist and communitarian critiques of atomistic
conceptions of autonomy and self-reliance. Relational autonomy theories,
developed primarily by feminist philosophers since the late 1980s, challenge
the view that autonomy requires independence from social relationships.
Instead, they argue that autonomy is constituted through—not despite—our
social embeddedness. Key debates include: (1) whether relational accounts
are causally or constitutively relational; (2) whether they are procedural
or substantive; (3) whether they risk paternalism by making oppressive social
conditions autonomy-undermining. Communitarian philosophers (Sandel, MacIntyre,
Taylor, Walzer) argue that liberal individualism neglects how communities shape
moral identities. Care ethicists (Held, Noddings) emphasize interdependence
and the moral significance of caring relationships, rejecting self-sufficiency
as an ideal. Recent work (Khader 2020) raises concerns that relational autonomy
may deny agency to oppressed people, while defenders (Humphries 2025, Mackenzie
2019) argue it better captures constraints on autonomy under oppression.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides critical counterbalance to individualistic DIY valorization.
If autonomy is constituted relationally, then self-reliance may not always be
valuable—dependence on others may be constitutive of autonomy rather than
threatening to it. Care ethics challenges the moral priority of independence.
Communitarian critiques suggest that DIY individualism may reflect problematic
atomistic self-conceptions. These views directly challenge whether "doing it
yourself" is morally superior to receiving help or relying on others.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited direct engagement between relational autonomy literature and craft/DIY
practices. Most applications focus on bioethics, healthcare, and oppression.
Few papers explicitly address the moral value of self-reliance vs. mutual aid
in everyday contexts. The debate sometimes remains abstract; concrete examples
of when interdependence enhances autonomy (beyond healthcare) would strengthen
the literature. Seven entries lack abstracts (marked INCOMPLETE): foundational
edited collection Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000, Mackenzie 2019 overview, early
Nedelsky 1989 article, McLeod & Sherwin 2000 chapter, Stoljar 2017, Holroyd
2009, and Levy 2023. These remain in bibliography for reference but notes
provide sufficient context.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the tension between relational and atomistic autonomy conceptions.
Distinguish causally relational (relationships support autonomy development)
from constitutively relational (relationships partly define autonomy). Note
internal debate: does relational autonomy risk paternalism (Khader) or better
diagnose constraints (Humphries)? Connect to DIY question: does self-reliance
reflect atomistic ideal? Can accepting help manifest autonomy?

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Relational autonomy (Mackenzie/Stoljar, Westlund, Friedman): 11 papers - Autonomy requires/is shaped by supportive social relationships
- Care ethics (Held, Noddings): 2 papers - Interdependence and care are morally fundamental, not threats to autonomy
- Communitarian critique (Sandel): 2 papers - Liberal individualism neglects constitutive communities
- Feminist critics of relational autonomy (Khader): 1 paper - Socially constitutive accounts risk paternalism toward oppressed agents

DOMAIN: Labor, Alienation, and Meaningful Work

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the philosophical significance of labor and work, focusing on Marxist and contemporary theories of alienation, accounts of meaningful work, and debates about whether value resides in productive activity itself or its outcomes. Marx's theory of alienation under capitalism identifies how workers become separated from their labor, its products, their species-being, and other workers. Contemporary debates distinguish objective alienation (structural conditions preventing self-realization) from subjective alienation (workers' felt experience of estrangement). Meaningful work theories explore what makes work valuable beyond compensation: autonomy, skill exercise, social contribution, and recognition. Recent scholarship addresses automation's impact on meaningful work, the relationship between work and self-respect, and whether liberal political philosophy can accommodate meaningful work without perfectionist commitments.

Key tensions include: whether alienation inheres in the labor process itself or only under specific social relations (capitalism); whether meaningful work is defined by subjective experience, objective features, or normative criteria; and whether work's value lies in the activity (process) or its products (outcome). These debates directly address the DIY research question: if productive activity has intrinsic value, then delegation or automation may diminish something worthwhile even when outcomes are preserved.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the theoretical foundation for assessing whether "doing it yourself" has distinctive value beyond outcomes. If Marx is right that unalienated labor involves self-realization through productive activity, then delegation represents a loss even when products are identical. If meaningful work theorists are correct that work's value includes autonomy and skill exercise, then having others do tasks for you may forfeit these goods. The process-versus-outcome distinction in meaningful work debates maps directly onto the DIY question: Does the value lie in what you produce or how you produce it?

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work explicitly connecting alienation and meaningful work theories to personal (non-employment) productive activities like DIY projects, hobbies, or domestic production. Most literature focuses on employment relationships and wage labor. Little direct engagement with whether Marx's critique of alienated labor under capitalism applies to voluntary delegation in non-capitalist contexts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish carefully between alienation under capitalist employment (Marx's primary target) and voluntary delegation in other contexts. Note that meaningful work theories often emphasize both process and outcome, not pure process-value. Consider whether unalienated labor requires social recognition (Kandiyali) or can be solitary. Address whether automation differs morally from human delegation.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical Marxist: Alienation arises from capitalist property relations, not labor per se (5 papers)
- Meaningful work (liberal): Work valuable when it enables autonomy, skill development, contribution (6 papers)
- Process-value emphasis: Labor's intrinsic value in self-realization through activity (4 papers)
- Outcome-centered: Work's value primarily instrumental or in products, not process (3 papers)

DOMAIN: Critical Perspectives on Self-Reliance

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses philosophical arguments against the valorization of self-reliance and doing-it-yourself (DIY). The literature reveals three major critical perspectives. First, the division of cognitive labor literature (Kitcher, Alexander et al.) argues that specialization and reliance on experts is epistemically superior to individual self-sufficiency in complex knowledge domains. Second, the epistemic dependence literature (Nguyen, Buzzell & Rini, Carter) shows that attempting epistemic self-reliance is often impossible or counterproductive given our cognitive limitations and the structure of modern knowledge. Third, work on delegation and outsourcing (Fisher & Oppenheimer, Ahlstrom-Vij) demonstrates how reliance on others can be both efficient and epistemically virtuous when done appropriately.

A key finding across these literatures is that self-reliance often represents an epistemically irresponsible stance rather than a virtue. "Doing your own research" can lead to misinformation and conspiracy theories when individuals lack the expertise to evaluate complex domains. Similarly, refusing to delegate cognitive labor to experts can undermine both individual and collective epistemic performance. The literature identifies conditions where delegation is morally and epistemically preferable to DIY: when expertise is genuine, when trust relationships are well-calibrated, and when division of labor enables more efficient knowledge production.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential critical counterweight to valorizations of self-reliance in the moral value of DIY project. It identifies cases where delegation is superior to self-sufficiency and where self-reliance becomes epistemically and morally problematic. The literature on division of cognitive labor directly challenges the assumption that doing things yourself is always valuable, showing how specialization and dependence can be epistemically virtuous.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most literature focuses on epistemic rather than moral arguments. Few papers explicitly address the moral value of delegation versus DIY in non-epistemic domains. The relationship between epistemic dependence and moral responsibility for outcomes remains under-theorized. Limited discussion of how to balance self-reliance and delegation across different life domains.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesis should contrast division of labor arguments with self-reliance valorizations. Key tension: When does epistemic/moral humility require delegation rather than DIY? Consider how cognitive limitations make some forms of self-reliance impossible or irresponsible. Address the conditions under which trust and delegation are virtuous versus when they represent abdication of responsibility.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Division of labor advocates: Specialization epistemically superior to generalism (Kitcher, Alexander et al.) (8 papers)
- Epistemic dependence theorists: Self-reliance often impossible/harmful (Nguyen, Buzzell & Rini) (6 papers)
- Moderate integrationists: Balance autonomy with appropriate reliance (Carter, Ahlstrom-Vij) (4 papers)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Frankfurt argues that what distinguishes persons from other creatures is the capacity for reflective self-evaluation manifest in second-order desires. A person has free will when they have the will they want to have—when their first-order desires align with their second-order volitions. Frankfurt develops a hierarchical model where autonomy consists in identification with one's effective first-order desires through higher-order endorsement, rather than requiring alternative possibilities.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for hierarchical theories of autonomy. It directly addresses whether autonomous action requires that the agent's own desires move them to act, or whether external determination of action undermines autonomy. For DIY ethics, the question is whether having someone else perform an action for you compromises the hierarchical structure Frankfurt identifies as essential to personhood and autonomy—does delegation sever the connection between second-order volitions and effective action?

As it happens—though it seems extraordinary that this should be so—there is no common English word for the type of entity Strawson has in mind, a type that includes not only human beings but animals of various lesser species as well.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Garnett argues that certain forms of practical deference undermine autonomy not by compromising authenticity or reason-tracking, but by constituting a specific social relation of interpersonal rule. When an agent systematically defers to another's practical judgment, they establish a relationship where the other person partially governs their life. This form of deference entails a partial disconnection from the good of a self-authored life, even when the deferring agent reflectively endorses the arrangement.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the moral status of letting others make decisions for you, which is central to DIY ethics. Garnett's analysis suggests that systematic delegation of practical judgment (not just action) to others constitutes a form of heteronomy. The question for DIY ethics is whether hiring someone to perform a task involves the kind of practical deference Garnett identifies, or whether one can maintain autonomous control over one's life plan while outsourcing execution to others.

  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315204932},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Killmister develops a multidimensional theory that distinguishes four distinct components of autonomy: self-definition (identifying with certain desires/values), self-realization (acting on those values), self-unification (coherence across time), and self-constitution (developing one's capacity for autonomy). She argues that previous theories err by treating autonomy as a single unified capacity when it actually involves multiple distinct but interrelated dimensions. Autonomy can be present in some dimensions while absent in others.

  RELEVANCE: Killmister's multidimensional framework is directly relevant to DIY ethics because it allows us to ask whether delegation affects different dimensions of autonomy differently. Perhaps outsourcing tasks compromises self-realization (acting on one's values through one's own efforts) without affecting self-definition (identifying with the goal of getting the task done). The framework provides conceptual tools for a nuanced analysis of how different forms of delegation affect autonomy.

  POSITION: Multidimensional account—autonomy consists of multiple distinct components that can vary independently.
  },
  keywords = {autonomy, multidimensional-theory, self-governance, High},
  abstract = {This ambitious book cuts against the grain. Killmister lays out a framework for thinking about autonomy that eschews the received view in many quarters. Difficulty reconciling the various uses to which "autonomy" is put has led to calls for a moratorium on our use of the term. Killmister demurs. Good for her. Her view centers on the idea that there are several dimensions to autonomy, and while they are related, one may fall short in one but not the others. The result is a nuanced theory of autonomy that illuminates how the concept applies in a range of domains and to a range of agents.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Killmister puts a wealth of cases to good use. This is especially helpful given that she begins with a barrage of distinctions, and the pace keeps up for some time. (By my count, we get 15 distinctions by the bottom of page 7!) It would've been nice for this reader to have a sense of what is at stake, aside from the fact that, despite it not being "a term we often hear in everyday conversation," autonomy names something "people are already implicitly tracking" (1). Sure enough, we do recoil from paternalist interventions in our lives and judge each other in "autonomy-related" ways. This helps to explain why we want a theory that yields the correct verdicts in a range of cases and illuminates connections with closely related concepts. If we didn't think autonomy mattered, there'd be no need for such a fuss.

And yet, so far as I see, Killmister simply assumes that we are right about this. She doesn't elaborate on autonomy's importance to us or argue that we are correct to care about it. This is a shame. Interrogating the notion that autonomy matters can help to shed light on how we should think about the concept. This is a point I'll return to. But first I want to say something about Killmister's four-dimensional theory and its virtues.

Though I have complained about the number of distinctions and the speed with which they come at you, at the end of the day, they pay off. Killmister analyzes autonomy along four interrelated, yet distinct dimensions. The first three flesh out the 'self' of self-governance and concern what she labelslocalautonomy. The first,self-definition, concerns the various attitudes that bring with them "agential commitments." Given that one valuesxor believesyor haszas a goal, there is something that one ought to do or be. These attitudes provide normative standards; one's values, beliefs, and goals may be more or less coherent. And the more coherent one's self-defining attitudes, the more autonomous one is along this first dimension.

While self-definition is about the agent's identity, the second dimension,self-realisation,is about her agency. It concerns the commitments one takes on in virtue of deliberating in the service of forming intentions (internal self-realisation), as well as the commitments one takes on in virtue of intending in the service of acting (external self-realisation). Killmister helpfully points out that there are various ways of falling short of the standards set by these commitments -- for example, one might akratically intend what one recognizes as the worse option or fail to do as one intends due to a false belief.

The third dimension of autonomy,self-unification, has to do with integrating the previous two. Do one's intentions and actions uphold the commitments that stem from one's beliefs, values, and goals? Does one alter one's identity in the ways one intends to? Here, Killmister's is a no-priority view: one can autonomously resolve cases of conflict -- for example, intending to do something that goes against one's values -- either by altering the intention or altering the values. I'm not convinced. This aspect of the view appears to rely on a conception of intentions on which they may be authoritatively formed independently of the agent's values. I don't think that's correct. But it's noteworthy because it's emblematic of a general tendency in Killmister's thought. She focuses on the structure of autonomy, not its substance. And so she avoids taking a stand on issues regarding how exactly to fill in the framework she so carefully lays out. Shortly, I'll say a bit more about why I think this general tendency is mistaken.

The fourth dimension,self-constitution, concerns "the extent to which an agent is in the business of taking on commitments" as opposed to upholding them (69). This dimension capturesglobalautonomy and sets a minimum threshold for being autonomous -- that is, for being the kind of agent for whom paternalism, consent, moral responsibility, and distinctive forms of respect are an issue. There are three requirements: (1) the agent must have some values, beliefs, or goals; (2) the agent must be willing and able to seriously deliberate and act; and (3) the agent must be able to unify her attitudes and exercises of agency. Interestingly, Killmister argues that one can fall short of one of these requirements while satisfying the others. Thus, meeting the minimum threshold is not a simple all-or-nothing affair. Moreover, this dimension admits of degrees and localized failures. Someone whose self-defining attitudes are wider in scope is more autonomous along the dimension of self-constitution than one whose self-defining attitudes are narrower in scope, and bouts of severe pain may temporarily disrupt one's willingness to deliberate, rendering one less globally autonomous for some time. These added nuances are welcome.

And they are not confined to the fourth dimension of autonomy alone. One of the main attractions of Killmister's view is that it allows for nuanced analysis of a wide range of cases. For example, her view yields the interesting conclusion that the "contented slave" and "deferential wife" are both highly locally autonomous, and yet they suffer from a deficit of global autonomy. Thus, her view is able to illuminate the "double bind" hemming such agents in: they can only increase their global autonomy at the expense of reducing their local autonomy, and vice versa. The view also yields interesting insights about the ways in which oppression diminishes autonomy and the ways in which interventions may serve to enhance it. Here Killmister should be applauded for attending to questions about the autonomy of disabled persons, who often don't get the attention they deserve.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mackenzie provides an authoritative overview of relational autonomy theories, distinguishing internalist from externalist and procedural from substantive approaches. She proposes a multidimensional analysis that distinguishes self-determination (capacities for practical reasoning), self-governance (higher-order reflection), and self-authorization (taking up agentic authority) as distinct dimensions. Crucially, she argues that social oppression can impair autonomy in multiple ways by affecting these different dimensions through different mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: Mackenzie's framework is essential for understanding debates about whether autonomy requires independence or can be compatible with dependence and delegation. Her distinction between self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization helps clarify whether DIY activities are valuable because they are necessary for one dimension of autonomy (perhaps self-realization or self-authorization) even if they are not necessary for other dimensions. The paper also addresses how social relationships enable rather than undermine autonomy.

It proposes that a multidimensional analysis of autonomy offers a possible resolution to these debates. Specifically, the chapter argues for the importance of distinguishing self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization as distinct although causally interacting dimensions of relational autonomy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors argue that the individualistic understanding of autonomy dominant in clinical practice and research is inadequate because it treats people as independent, self-interested, rational decision-makers. They propose that relational autonomy—which recognizes that identities, needs, and interests are shaped by relationships—can provide practical solutions to ethical problems in clinical settings. They examine four case studies showing how relational autonomy can facilitate consideration of care and responsibility for connected others while preserving ultimate decisional authority.

  RELEVANCE: This paper shows how relational autonomy can be operationalized in practice, not just theorized abstractly. For DIY ethics, it suggests that autonomous decisions about whether to do things oneself or delegate may legitimately be influenced by consideration of relationships and responsibilities to others. The paper challenges the assumption that autonomous choice must be made by an isolated individual considering only their own interests.

In recent decades, this paradigm has been challenged from various disciplinary and intellectual directions. Proponents of ‘relational autonomy’ in particular have argued that people’s identities, needs, interests – and indeed autonomy – are always also shaped by their relations to others. Yet, despite the pronounced and nuanced critique directed at an individualistic understanding of autonomy, this critique has had very little effect on ethical and legal instruments in clinical practice and research so far. In this article, we use four case studies to explore to what extent, if at all, relational autonomy can provide solutions to ethical and practical problems in clinical practice and research. We conclude that certain forms of relational autonomy can have a tangible and positive impact on clinical practice and research. These solutions leave the ultimate decision to the person most affected, but encourage and facilitate the consideration of this person’s care and responsibility for connected others.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume established relational autonomy as a major research program in philosophy. The contributors argue that traditional accounts of autonomy that emphasize independence, self-sufficiency, and rational self-interest are inadequate because they ignore the social dimensions of selfhood and agency. Autonomy should be understood as a capacity that develops through and is exercised within social relationships, and oppressive social conditions can undermine autonomy even when agents reflectively endorse their choices. The volume includes both causal and constitutive relational theories.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational text is essential for understanding the relational autonomy tradition that challenges individualistic assumptions. For DIY ethics, it raises the question of whether the value of doing things oneself stems from an individualistic ideal of self-sufficiency that relational theorists would reject. Alternatively, relational autonomy might support DIY activities as ways of developing autonomous capacities through engagement with others and the world.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Westlund defends a constitutively relational account of autonomy against Christman's charge that such accounts are problematically perfectionist. She argues that autonomy is dialogical—it requires accountability to others in the sense that autonomous agents must be prepared to answer for themselves and their commitments. This dialogical structure is constitutive of autonomy rather than an external condition. However, this does not entail perfectionism about the good life because the dialogical condition is formal and content-neutral.

  RELEVANCE: Westlund's dialogical account suggests that autonomy requires responsiveness to others' perspectives and potential challenges, which complicates the DIY question. If autonomy is inherently dialogical, then completely independent action might actually be less autonomous than action coordinated with others. The paper helps clarify whether DIY activities are valuable because they enhance dialogical accountability or whether delegation can preserve such accountability.

Khader contends these accounts fail as both character ideals and paternalism-limiting concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Major internal critique of relational autonomy from a feminist perspective. If Khader is right, then emphasizing social conditions for autonomy could patronize those in oppressive situations who rely on themselves.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman develops a planning theory account of autonomy that grounds self-governance in the agent's temporally extended planning agency. Autonomous desire and action require satisfaction of planning-theoretic demands for consistency, coherence, and stability in the agent's hierarchical system of plans and policies. Self-governing policies play a central coordinating role in the agent's life over time. Autonomy is a matter of the functioning of this planning system rather than mere reflective endorsement at a moment.

  RELEVANCE: Bratman's account extends Frankfurt's hierarchical model with emphasis on temporal extension and planning. For DIY ethics, the question is whether engaging in an activity oneself or delegating it affects the coherence and stability of one's planning system. Perhaps autonomous agents need to maintain certain higher-order policies about which domains of their life they will govern directly versus delegate, and DIY activities might be those that fall under policies of direct governance.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Benson argues that free agency requires not just internal coherence of desires (as in Frankfurt's account) but also that the agent regard herself as competent to answer for her actions in the normative sense. Autonomy requires a sense of self-worth—specifically, the conviction that one's evaluative judgments are worthy of respect. Oppression can undermine autonomy by damaging an agent's sense of self-worth even when their desires are internally coherent.

  RELEVANCE: Benson's emphasis on self-worth and normative competence suggests a connection between autonomy and the development of competencies through practice. DIY activities might be valuable because engaging in them oneself develops and maintains the sense of competence that Benson identifies as necessary for autonomy. Systematically delegating tasks to others might erode this sense of normative competence over time.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fischer and Ravizza develop a reasons-responsive theory of moral responsibility where an agent is responsible for an action when it issues from their own, moderately reasons-responsive mechanism. They distinguish guidance control (necessary for responsibility) from regulative control (requiring alternative possibilities). An agent has guidance control when they act from a mechanism that is responsive to reasons in an appropriate way, including recognition of sufficient reasons to act otherwise.

  RELEVANCE: The reasons-responsive framework provides an alternative to hierarchical theories for thinking about autonomy and control. For DIY ethics, the question is whether delegating a task to another person means the action no longer issues from the agent's own reasons-responsive mechanism. If autonomous action requires that it flow from the agent's own capacity to respond to reasons, then having another person execute the action might compromise autonomy even if the agent maintains control over outcomes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Oshana argues for an externalist, socially constituted account of autonomy where external social conditions are not merely enabling conditions but constitutive of autonomy itself. Personal autonomy requires both internal psychological conditions and external political conditions of non-domination and self-governance. Social structures and relationships can determine whether an agent is autonomous regardless of the agent's internal psychological states or reflective endorsement.

  RELEVANCE: Oshana's strongly externalist account raises questions about whether autonomy can be achieved through purely individual action or whether it necessarily involves participation in social structures. For DIY ethics, her view might suggest that the value of doing things oneself depends heavily on the social context—DIY activities might promote autonomy by establishing relationships of independence and non-domination, but delegation need not undermine autonomy if it occurs within egalitarian social relationships.

While acknowledging that selves are socially constituted, Christman maintains that autonomy is compatible with flawed social conditions as long as the agent does not feel alienated from the process of self-development when authentically reflecting on it.

  RELEVANCE: Christman's procedural internalist account provides a middle ground between strongly individualistic and strongly relational accounts. For DIY ethics, his view suggests that what matters is whether the agent identifies with the decision to do something oneself versus delegate, not whether one approach is inherently more autonomous. The value of DIY might be not that it is necessary for autonomy but that it satisfies certain agents' authentic values about how to live.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stoljar develops a substantive account of relational autonomy that includes a normative competence condition. She argues that purely procedural accounts fail to capture the feminist intuition that agents whose preferences are shaped by oppressive socialization lack autonomy. Autonomy requires not just reflection on one's desires but also that one's capacity for normative reflection not be damaged by oppressive norms. Substantive conditions on autonomy are necessary to identify when socialization undermines autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Stoljar's substantive account raises questions about whether social norms that valorize either DIY activities or delegation might affect autonomy. If preferences for doing things oneself are shaped by oppressive norms of self-reliance that prevent people from accepting help, those preferences might be non-autonomous. Conversely, if preferences for delegation are shaped by norms that denigrate manual labor or practical skills, those preferences might also be non-autonomous.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson critiques purely coherentist theories of autonomy (like Frankfurt's) that ground autonomy in internal coherence of desires.

Autonomous agents must have their commitments recognized as authoritative by others. This social dimension is not just an enabling condition but constitutive of the authority that autonomous commitments have.

  RELEVANCE: Anderson's emphasis on social recognition complicates the DIY question by suggesting that autonomous action might require that one's choices be recognizable to others as expressions of commitment. If DIY activities are valued because they make one's commitments publicly legible in a way that delegation does not, this would support the intrinsic value of doing things oneself. However, it might also mean that in communities where delegation is the norm, DIY activities could undermine autonomy by appearing eccentric or unintelligible.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kawall develops an account of epistemic autonomy as a wide-ranging epistemic virtue that helps understand phenomena from method selection to epistemic oppression.

Epistemic autonomy shapes most aspects of our epistemic lives and must ultimately reliably lead to valuable epistemic goods.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on epistemic rather than practical autonomy, Kawall's framework suggests that autonomy in any domain involves appropriate selection of methods and goals. For DIY ethics, this raises the question of whether practical autonomy similarly requires that agents have control over the methods they use to achieve their goals, not just the goals themselves. If practical autonomy involves choosing one's methods of action, this might support the value of DIY activities over delegation.

The account draws on four elements commonly incorporated into accounts of personal autonomy: (i) self-governance, (ii) authenticity, (iii) self-creation and (iv) independence. I further argue that for a distinctively epistemic virtue of autonomy; the above elements must ultimately reliably lead to valuable epistemic goods (for the agent herself and others). I then turn to the domains or ways in which epistemic autonomy so understood, can be made manifest. I suggest that epistemic autonomy is a virtue that allows us to appropriately choose (i) subject matters and areas of inquiry, (ii) methods, sources, and processes of belief formation, (iii) epistemic goals and (iv) epistemic stances or frameworks.

They propose a relational turn in AI ethics drawing on relational autonomy theories and Ubuntu ethics, emphasizing interdependence and collective well-being. The relational approach better captures how AI systems can violate autonomy through effects on relationships and social structures, not just individual decision-making.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends relational autonomy to the context of AI and technological systems. For DIY ethics in the age of AI assistants and automation, it raises questions about whether using AI tools constitutes a form of delegation that affects relational autonomy differently than delegation to human agents.

In particular, we claim that the adherence to such principle, as currently formalized, does not only fail to address many ways in which people’s autonomy can be violated, but also to grasp a broader range of AI-empowered harms profoundly tied to the legacy of colonization, and which particularly affect the already marginalized and most vulnerable on a global scale. To counter such a phenomenon, we advocate for the need of a relational turn in AI ethics, starting from a relational rethinking of the AI ethics principle of autonomy that we propose by drawing on theories on relational autonomy developed both in moral philosophy and Ubuntu ethics.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Swaine elaborates a conception of personal autonomy as individual self-rule, understood as consistent with but distinct from self-governance or living under one's own laws. He distinguishes personal autonomy from individual freedom and from absence of social control. The chapter describes grounds for valuing personal autonomy including its connection to dignity, responsibility, and the meaningfulness of life. Personal autonomy as self-rule is not heavily moralized and can be impaired by various internal and external factors.

  RELEVANCE: Swaine's conceptual clarification of autonomy as self-rule rather than self-governance or freedom helps distinguish different aspects of autonomous agency relevant to DIY ethics. If autonomy is fundamentally about ruling oneself, the question is whether delegating tasks means one ceases to rule that domain of one's life or whether one can rule through delegation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Authenticity is a defensible moral ideal when properly understood as requiring self-transcendence through engagement with horizons of significance beyond the self. Against critics who see authenticity as mere self-indulgence, Taylor argues the original Romantic ideal contains an essential element of connection to values and meanings that transcend individual preference. Authentic self-realization requires dialogical engagement with others and critical appropriation of shared cultural frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether doing things yourself has moral value. Taylor's account suggests authenticity requires not just self-expression but engagement with genuinely valuable projects. This constrains DIY ethics: not every self-directed activity is authentically valuable, only those connected to inter-subjective horizons of meaning. The emphasis on self-transcendence suggests limits to pure self-authorship.

  abstract = {It has long been customary for America's freestanding colleges to support philosophical gurus, whose presence helped to make those institutions what they were: seedbeds (that is, "seminaries") of critical thinking, where young over-achievers would be invited to scrutinize the import of their "career plans." One wonders whether the goal-driven aspirations of today's academe will allow such figures to be replaced as they become emeriti, but we can hope "in sh'Allah!" The two figures compared and contrasted in this valedictory study -- Charles Taylor and Bernard Lonergan -- have functioned that way for many on a far wider screen. But how can one be a philosophical guru on the world scene? Brian Braman's analysis of each thinker helps to respond to that question, in the measure that one can. Focusing on "authenticity" allows him to elucidate the point of the engagement in inquiry which they share, and suggest how each of them might help us to find and execute thepointof our own intellectual inquiry. In that sense, each of these prospective mentors exhibits thetelosproper to classical philosophy: searching for what is true and good, and doing so in such a way as to appropriate what we discover; that is, make it our own. For the promise of philosophical inquiry has ever been to carry us beyond the preoccupations of our mundane selves, which Braman takes to be the sense of "authenticity" which they share: "a way of living one's life in a new dimension" (98-99). I take that final characterization of his study to be both more modest and more accurate than his definition opening the concluding chapter: "authenticity for Taylor and Lonergan is the experience of a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing" (98). For if Lonergan can freely use the term 'experience', that is only (I would surmise) because he seems quite innocent of that loaded "subjective" sense which Taylor is astute enough to avoid. So replacing 'is the experience of', from Braman's valedictory statement, with the more modest 'reflects' will offer a less contested summary of the subject of his inquiry: "authenticity for Taylor and Lonergan reflects a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing."
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Now "transfigurations" normally defy descriptive language, precisely because what takes place there invites us well beyond the ordinary reach of our discourse, invariably moving us to evocative and analogous speech, so leading into what Kierkegaard dubbed "edifying discourse." And if that goal never escaped classical philosophical inquiry, it has come to describe, in our time, the role of gurus. That alteration in the very conception and practice of "philosophy" deserves more than comment, and Taylor himself has devoted more than 900 pages to exploring the manifold factors helping to bring it about in his recentA Secular Age; yet for now let it simply explain why those of us fortunate enough to encounter such inspiring teachers often found them more engaging in person than in print. In fact, many of them wrote little, though some, like these, have been prolific. Yet even here the teacher/student encounter will differ qualitatively from that of readers encountering their written works, as Plato insisted in hisSeventh Letter. In fact, I have often found it difficult to introduce friends and colleagues to two of my most inspiring teachers -- Bernard Lonergan for one, and Wilfrid Sellars for another -- with only their writings to offer. And my brief but intense interaction with Charles Taylor (in Oxford in 2005) suggests something similar. Not that his writings or those of Bernard Lonergan cannot effect a stimulating entrée into their respective worlds and intentions, but that personal encounter will do it far better. And that precisely because their respective "worlds" are ever calling them and their students beyond themselves. For their distinctive modes of inquiry are designed to respect and to implement thetelosproper to philosophical inquiry, which seeks to realize Socrates' ideal of consistency between thought and action; that is, to move beyond mere logical consistency to personal appropriation. Again, that is what prospective students often anticipate in "philosophy," and if they find themselves disappointed rather than fulfilled, we (philosophers) have no one to blame but ourselves! For we have regularly been taught to settle for (indeed to make an icon of) "logical consistency," while relegating Socrates' further call to another realm; perhaps to "theology."

Yet recalling that quite modern bifurcation -- philosophy/theology -- exhibits another merit of Braman's study, for by rightly eschewing the labels yet directing us to the mentors inspiring each -- Heidegger for Taylor and Aquinas for Lonergan -- he gestures towards their respective horizons: philosophical for Taylor and theological for Lonergan. Yet again, he is wise not to offer those distracting labels but moves immediately to the way each elucidates a path to "a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing." While Taylor employs a hermeneutic strategy redolent of Heidegger, he nevertheless focuses his "moral ontology [on]phronesis-- practical reasoning," in the spirit of "Aristotle'saletheuein-- living in the truth" (37). So then it becomes natural to raise "demands for ethical judgments," or those constitutive goods which Taylor dubs "hypergoods": "that is, goods that are not only incomparably more important than the others but provide the standpoint from which these must be weighed and decided about" (30). In other words, the dialectical progression built into our inherently analogous use of 'good' demands that we find one which will order the others. Taylor buttresses this characteristically Augustinian move with the notion ofepiphany: "the manifestation which brings us into the presence of something which is otherwise inaccessible, and which is of the highest moral or spiritual significance" (43). Astute readers will note how recourse to "knowing by presence" is latent in the cognate notions ofmanifestationorpresence, so as neatly to bypass modern preoccupations with "representation" or analytic demands for "conceptualization." Yet the very term 'epiphany' reminds us that this step is already latent in the activity of interpretation which shapes philosophical inquiry for Taylor. Although epiphanies will arise freely, they are neither totally unexpected nor unrecognizable when they do arise. These "hypergoods" must be the goal inherent in our entire activity of inquiry.

Here lies the interior point of connection between Taylor and Lonergan, between two Canadians of different generations yet like-minded in their faith; one a quintessential university person, and the other a Jesuit whose formation in the "spiritual exercises" of Ignatius of Loyola became more evident as his life of inquiry unfolded, from Canada to England, then to Rome, and finally to Boston College in the United States. While those who have inquired into Lonergan's patterns of thought tend to find the inspiration for his dynamic epistemology in the Belgian Jesuit, Maréchal, his own reflections turn to John Henry Newman as his professed mentor. It is Newman of theGrammar of Assent, for whom understanding is a thoroughly personal engagement with realities which mind alone can discern. Following Newman at this crucial juncture, "Lonergan understands knowledge as performative -- knowledge of the subject as subject in act (engaged)" (81), as the mind itself "is a dynamic longing within the person for wholeness and completion" (56). Indeed, both Lonergan and Taylor are clear about “coming to know [as] a common enterprise" (82). Lonergan locates this quest in "the dynamic unity of consciousness as experiencing, understanding, and judging that constitutes human knowing in its fullest and truest sense" (61). "Under the sway of reason," the desire to know is distinguished from all other desires in that it "does not seek to possess, master, or control its object" (60). So we are not surprised to learn that the detachment inherent in such a desire (de Chardin) tends ineluctably towards a threefold "conversion: intellectual, moral and religious" (59). Lonergan will then identify "intellectual conversion [as] the affirmation of our self as knower" (62), moral conversion as the exigency for performative consistency (Socrates), and religious conversion as coming to "be in love with the divine ground [which] reveals to us to whom we are ultimately responsible and to whom we ultimately respond in self-transcending love" (68). This is, of course, full-blown theological language, which Lonergan is freer to use than Taylor, insisting that "sustained authenticity is impossible without growth in a loving relationship fully brought to fruition by being in love with the source of all meaning and value" (94).

So Braman concludes by reminding us how both "Taylor and Lonergan agree with Augustine in holding the priority of love [over] knowledge" (99). Although such an affirmation was always latent in the inner dynamic of Lonergan's "unrestricted desire to know," affirming it remained for him a later development, much as Taylor's explicit faith pronouncements would wait for the more autobiographical remarks found in James Heft's edition:A Catholic Modernity(Oxford, 1999). Gurus can become gurus only when they are addressing a palpable need, yet will continue to be so only as they lead those with such needs to a critical appropriation of their own desire to know and to love. So if the language must be theological in the end, the modality will be thoroughly philosophical, so Braman's way of finessing that difference between these two is again to be commended.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Authenticity is both a personal virtue and a fundamentally social commitment. Guignon traces the concept's historical development from Rousseau through existentialism to contemporary culture, arguing that coherent authenticity requires reflective discernment of what is genuinely worth pursuing in one's social context. Authentic individuals must commit to sustaining the type of free society in which authenticity is possible, making it an irreducibly political virtue in democratic contexts.

For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things yourself has value not just as self-expression but as participation in sustaining democratic life. The capacity for clear self-awareness and public expression of one's stance is precisely what democratic societies require, linking personal authenticity to civic virtue.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes essentialist authenticity (true self as discovered inborn traits) from existentialist authenticity (true self as values-driven self-invention). Argues authenticity emerges not only via matching actions to some true self but also through "poiesis"—humane self-making processes. Mature authenticity emphasizes interdependent self-actualizing rather than mere independence, correcting common oversimplifications of self-actualization theory.

  RELEVANCE: The essentialist/existentialist distinction is crucial for DIY ethics. Essentialist authenticity doesn't necessarily ground doing things yourself (one could discover one's "true nature" through passivity). Existentialist authenticity, emphasizing self-making through values-driven action, more directly supports the moral value of DIY: one authors oneself through the process of doing, not just the outcome. The emphasis on poiesis (self-making processes) over mere matching suggests process has independent value.

Essentialist authenticity defines the true self as solely a matter of self-discovery and being true to one’s inborn traits or perceived soul. Existentialist authenticity also values self-discovery but emphasizes self-invention and being true to one’s values. Essentialist authenticity does not necessitate moral concerns, but existentialist authenticity does. The chapter argues that authenticity emerges not only via the matching principle of authenticity (matching actions with some true self) but also via the poiesis principle (the humane, self-making processes and perspectivity of a quiet ego). Youthful authenticity emphasizes independence and identity consolidation, whereas mature authenticity emphasizes interdependent self-actualizing. The chapter then examines self-actualization as maturely authentic self-understanding. Finally, the chapter reframes Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to correct common oversimplifications of belongingness and esteem in light of the developing, transformative self.},

When we believe it's important to form moral beliefs ourselves rather than accept them on testimony, we're implicitly valuing authenticity—the idea that one's moral beliefs must originate in oneself to have proper authority or meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the DIY question in epistemic/moral contexts: why does it matter whether we form beliefs ourselves versus accepting them from reliable sources? Mogensen's analysis reveals that authenticity ideals ground the intuition that the process (forming beliefs oneself) matters beyond outcomes (having true beliefs). This provides a model for extending DIY intuitions beyond belief formation to practical activities: perhaps we value doing things ourselves because we implicitly value authenticity in action, not just belief.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques procedural autonomy theories (especially Christman's) for their reliance on authenticity requirements, which fail to detect forms of heteronomy arising from social oppression. Argues that oppression often produces preferences that feel authentic to agents (coherent, reflectively endorsed) but actually reflect internalized oppression. Procedural accounts should avoid authenticity injunctions and instead require self-problematization from a social perspective.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the link between authenticity and genuine agency/self-authorship. For DIY ethics, this suggests caution: doing things "oneself" may not track genuine agency if one's sense of what to do oneself reflects oppressive social conditioning.

Proceduralists favour the first strategy and substantive theorists restrict more explicitly the conditions under which autonomy is possible. I focus on forms of heteronomy which derive from oppressive circumstances and accept that substantive theorists are correct in contending that (i) forms of oppression common in contemporary liberal societies (e.g. gender or racial oppression) tend to increase heteronomy; and (ii) the heteronomy which derives from social oppression tends to fly below the radar of procedural accounts. Still, I argue that a revised procedural strategy could limit these forms of heteronomy as long as it avoids the injunctions to ‘authenticity’ common in procedural models. I proceed by reconstructing John Christman’s model which, I argue, constitutes the most promising procedural account to assess autonomy under oppression. Christman’s theory, however, needs to be reinforced to ensure self-problematisation in light of a social perspective. I show that the latter is necessary to experience the forms of alienation which are markers of heteronomy according to Christman.},

Argues that authenticity, properly understood, is not opposed to social life but requires it—being true to oneself involves clarity about one's commitments and willingness to express them publicly. In democratic contexts, authenticity becomes a character ideal supporting effective citizenship: the capacity to know one's own mind and advocate for it is precisely what democracy requires.

  RELEVANCE: Provides concise overview of authenticity debates and their connection to democratic life. For DIY ethics, the emphasis on authenticity as public self-expression (not just private self-feeling) suggests that doing things yourself matters partly as a mode of engaging with social life.

Demarcation of authenticity must take into account philosophical literature that argues that authenticity is an existential question of the ‘modern’ era. Thus, authenticity is offered to us as individuals as a remedy for the maladies of modernity: alienation, anomie and alterity. Authenticity is then discussed as a question of value within an economy of cultural politics that often draws on simulacra, creating cultural relics of dubious origin. The final section discusses various methodological failures and problematiques that are highlighted by the concern for, and scrutiny of, authenticity. The first is the simulacral failure. The subjects of anthropology are mostly real flesh-and-blood people-on-the-ground with real needs. In contrast is the simulacral subject, the brand, the tourist image, the media image or the ever-familiar hyper-real bushmen. Lastly, the article considers what Spivak calls ‘withholding’ – a resistance to authentic representation by the Other.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops account of authenticity within Dialogical Self Theory (DST), rejecting the humanist notion of a static "true self" in favor of viewing authenticity as involving how one is in one's actions and relationships. Authenticity emerges through (1) personal positions shaping social positions, (2) I-positions differing in openness and personal endorsement, (3) I-positions encompassing shared/collective identity, and (4) emotional tenor of experiences. Authenticity is dynamic, multifaceted, and situation-sensitive rather than monolithic.

  RELEVANCE: Offers contemporary psychological account avoiding essentialist authenticity while preserving its normative force. For DIY ethics, this suggests authenticity in action need not track a single "true self" but involves alignment between personal positions and enacted roles. Doing things yourself may matter because it allows fuller expression of personally endorsed positions rather than merely occupying prescribed social roles.

  abstract = {Abstract In dialogical self theory (DST) authenticity has not been a central concern. The humanist notion of a static, higher-order, superordinate, ultimate, and “true” self runs counter to the ontology of DST, and the conceptualization of the dialogical self as unconsolidated, multifaceted, dynamic, and sensitive to situational change. In a climate in which the psychology of authenticity is undergoing revision—and in which the existence of a “true” “inner” self is increasingly questioned—it is these qualities that make DST highly suited to the investigation of authenticity in contemporary life. Four aspects of DST can facilitate the exploration of authenticity: (1) the function of personal positions and their role in shaping and stylizing social positions, (2) how I-positions differ in relation to openness to innovation and the degree to which they are personally endorsed, (3) how I-positions can encompass a shared identity and can express a collective voice, and (4) the emotional tenor of experiences involving authenticity. To illustrate the utility of this conceptual assemblage, a case study of the authenticity experiences of an early-career language teacher is presented. The study demonstrates how, in the dialogical self, authenticity involves the experience of how one is in one’s actions and in one’s relationships.},

 There are cases of psychiatric disorder where affective states produce severely self‐destructive behavior. Sufferers do not appear to be making autonomous decisions, and appear to be severely impaired in their decision‐making capacity. Suffers of these kinds of cases of these kinds of disorders fall into a “gray area” in the law. If this gray area is to be avoided, the law requires clearer criteria for determining how affect can undermine autonomy. Existing “procedural” accounts of autonomy that explicitly set out to deal with how affective states can undermine decision‐making are unable to deal with a clinically significant class of such cases. In this class of cases, autonomy is undermined by an affective state that is relevantly coherent with the rest of the person's affective states and attitudes, and has relevantly inoffensive origins. The relevant affective state nevertheless appears to “hijack” the person, and to rule over them “tyrannically.” I argue for a necessary condition on autonomy amenable to a procedural account,
 non‐tyranny
 , according to which one is autonomous with respect to a decision only if one has the ability to resist the influence of any given affective state on that decision.

Essentialist perspectives reject genetic engineering, claiming it inherently compromises authenticity by deviating from a species-typical genome. In contrast, this article advocates for an existentialist interpretation of authenticity, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger and Sartre. Here, authenticity is understood as a dynamic and relational process rooted in individual choice, responsibility, and engagement with existential conditions. Unlike essentialism, existentialism evaluates genetic interventions not as inherently wrong but based on their alignment with values such as autonomy and authenticity, offering a more flexible and ethically robust framework. Existentialism's emphasis on individual freedom, self-determination, and the creation of meaning in life makes it ethically more compelling than essentialist frameworks, which impose deterministic constraints. Moreover, essentialist critiques falter when they concede the permissibility of therapeutic genetic engineering, undermining the notion of an inherently valuable species-typical human genome. In contrast, existentialism affirms the transformative potential of genetic engineering, recognising it as a means to expand autonomy, self-expression, and opportunities for flourishing when applied responsibly. The article advocates for a balanced ethical approach by integrating the Principle of Procreative Beneficence, which promotes enhancements to optimise flourishing, with the Principle of Procreative Non-Maleficence, which safeguards autonomy by preventing deterministic constraints. This complementary framework, grounded in an existentialist perspective, reframes authenticity as an evolving concept aligned with the transformative possibilities of genetic engineering, enriching the discourse on bioethics and identity in a rapidly changing era.},

In realizing (4), I identify aspects of the self not included in PTS which are desperately needed to investigate the full range of potentially relevant DBS-induced changes—authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility, and conclude that how we define authenticity will have implications for our concept of autonomy, which in turn will determine how we think about responsibility. Concerning (5), I discuss a complex relation between moral aspects and PTS—on one hand, they serve as the lens through which a particular self-pattern can be evaluated; on the other, they are, themselves, products of dynamical interactions of various self-aspects. Finally, I discuss (6), demonstrating novel way of understanding the effects of DBS on patients’ selves.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between authenticity and autonomy in multicultural contexts, analyzing how cultural membership and individual self-determination interact. Argues that authenticity claims can both support and undermine autonomy depending on whether they're used to constrain individual choice or enable meaningful self-expression within cultural frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Explores tensions between authenticity (being true to cultural identity) and autonomy (self-directed choice) in contexts where the two can conflict. For DIY ethics, this highlights that doing things "oneself" might mean different things: following culturally authentic practices versus autonomously choosing one's path. The paper suggests these ideals can diverge, complicating simple accounts of self-authorship.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Cicero's modification of the Stoic persona metaphor, arguing one must be not the actor but the author (auctor) of one's persona. Being an auctor in the profound sense means not primarily constructing social roles but accepting and affirming both rational human nature and existential contingencies. This rejects Stoic indifference and suggests a new relation between self and social roles.

  RELEVANCE: Historical analysis of self-authorship concept predating modern authenticity discourse. For DIY ethics, Cicero's distinction between acting and authoring one's persona suggests that genuine self-authorship involves acceptance and affirmation rather than pure construction. This complicates the idea that "doing it yourself" means creating from scratch—perhaps it means taking responsibility for what's given as well as what's chosen.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues Kierkegaard's teleological suspension of the ethical presupposes a theocentric anthropology where humanity's telos finds fulfillment in relationship with God.

Only the religious stage, initiated by teleological suspension and relating directly to God, achieves authenticity within a theocentric framework.

For DIY ethics, this suggests limits to pure self-authorship: if authenticity requires relationship with what transcends the self, then doing things "oneself" might paradoxically require submission to transcendent authority. This contrasts sharply with existentialist self-making models.

 This paper presents a specific interpretation of the teleological suspension of the ethical. It argues that the suspension presupposes a theocentric anthropology in which humanity’s telos finds fulfilment in relationship with God. In performing the suspension, the individual fulfils their telos. The argument develops by situating the suspension within Kierkegaard’s broader authorship.

 existential trajectory, where one moves from the aesthetic to the ethical and finally to the religious stage. Each transition occurs through a negation of the self and resulting despair. The aesthetic life fails because it grounds identity in externality, thereby undermining authenticity. The ethical life fails because it detaches duty from the person, once again denying authenticity. Initiated by the teleological suspension, the religious stage occurs when the self relates directly to God, achieving authenticity. To achieve authenticity, however, the religious stage must presuppose a theocentric anthropology in which one’s telos finds fulfilment in relation to God. It does so because only within such an anthropology does an individual gain authenticity and avoid the despair of the earlier stages by performing the suspension.

Through counterexamples where agents lack alternative possibilities yet remain responsible, Frankfurt demonstrates that control over one's actual choice-making process, not access to alternatives, grounds responsibility.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to delegation: if one can be responsible without alternatives, then delegating may not diminish responsibility even when it restricts one's options. However, this focuses on whether alternatives matter for responsibility attribution, not whether choosing to retain or relinquish control has intrinsic moral significance.

In seeking illustrations of the principle of alternate possibilities, it is most natural to think of situations in which the same circumstances both bring it about that a person does something and make it impossible for him to avoid doing it. The two main concepts employed in the principle of alternate possibilities are ‘morally responsible’ and ‘could have done otherwise.’ To discuss the principle without analyzing either of these concepts may well seem like an attempt at piracy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kutz argues for a "Complicity Principle" under which individuals are accountable for harms they participate in, even when their individual contribution makes no difference to the outcome.

  RELEVANCE: Central to the delegation question. If Kutz is right that participation matters more than causal difference-making, then delegating tasks to others may not absolve one of responsibility—one remains complicit in the outcome. However, this raises the reverse question: does retaining tasks rather than delegating also constitute a morally significant choice about participation?

  abstract = {Gregory Mellema’s short and lively book on the ethics of complicity, while decidedly a work of analytical philosophy, is ‘aimed at an audience that includes nonphilosophers’ (14). It has no notes, a limited bibliography, and thirteen bite-sized chapters. For the most part I found it easy and fun to read, powered as it is by piquant examples of everyday wrongdoing involving multiple agents. The primary and official focus of the book, as its title suggests, is on the situation in which wrongdoing by one agent (the ‘principal’, in this review ‘P’) is supported by another (the ‘accomplice’, in this review ‘A’). However, the book also attends (especially in chs 3 and 6) to some cases of collective or group agency which are not naturally classified as complicity cases. It engages, too, with other nearby topics such as cooperation (ch 9) and conspiracy (ch 12). Mellema is excellent at revealing subtle connections among these topics. But he is not so good at providing orientation. His book is oddly organised, with no obvious rationale for the way in which material is sequenced. Meanwhile the (presumably deliberate) paucity of references means that valuable opportunities are missed to relate what is being said to a wider range of philosophical literature.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That is not to say that Mellema ignores previous writings on complicity itself. On the contrary, each of Thomas Aquinas and Christopher Kutz has the honour of a chapter to himself (chs 2 and 3 respectively). H.D. Lewis and Karl Jaspers, representing opposite poles of radicalism about complicity — minimalist and maximalist respectively — share a chapter between them (ch 10). It is not clear that thesead hominemchapters represent optimal use of the limited space in the book. Let me qualify that: chapter 10 is a terrific read, full of testing and vexing thoughts. It is marred only by the fact that it comes too late to disabuse the reader of the comfortable bourgeois intuitions that are largely confirmed earlier in the book. The chapters on Aquinas and Kutz, by contrast, are intrinsically unsatisfying. They contain too much summary and too little (forthright) criticism. Quirks in each author’s scoping of the subject of complicity are thereby allowed to enter unchecked into Mellema’s own frame of analysis. Aquinas does not attach enough importance to the distinction between contributing to another’s wrongdoing on the one hand and contributing, on the other hand, to the wrongdoer’s getting away with her wrong or succeeding in her further purposes in committing it (‘complicity after the fact,’ as the common law calls it). Kutz, meanwhile, blends the puzzles of complicity prematurely into the puzzles of collective and group agency (foregrounding, e.g., the position of corporate shareholders and that of individual combatants in war). Mellema does too little to expose the difficulties to which these two moves give rise. His own positions and arguments, throughout the book, suffer from resulting contortions.

For example: Mellema wisely rules that ‘Apart from a contributing act, one cannot be complicit in the wrongdoing of another’ (68). Yet, with Aquinas’s taxonomy still in mind, he holds that A who ‘covers for’ (134) or ‘fails to denounce’ (68) P’s wrong could in principle be complicit in P’s wrong. How? Obviously it is too late now for A to contribute to P’s original wrong, which isex hypothesidone. A is now contributing, if to any wrong by P, then to a second wrong that P has not yet finished committing — say, that of evading justice in respect of her first wrong. Why say that this is A’s complicity (‘after the fact’) in P’s first wrong, rather than A’s complicity (‘before the fact’) in P’s second wrong? Mellema’s book would have been easier to follow, and closer to the truth, if he had gone for the second analysis and abandoned the whole idea of complicity ‘after the fact’ as a lawyer’s confusion. He could likewise have made the book simpler and sounder by keeping Kutz-inspired worries about corporations and their shareholders, armies and their soldiers, etc. completely out of the way until the more rudimentary cases involving an individual P and an individual A had been fully explored and analyzed. Ch 6 (on collective and shared responsibility), ch 9 (on well-integrated actions), and ch 11 (on indirect accomplices) could in my view have been more helpfully clustered towards the end of the book. Reflections on Kutz’s important but specialized contribution could equally have been reserved to that part of the book, instead of muddying the waters so near to the start. Mellema’s first instinct is right: the problems of collective and shared agency are only ‘tangentially related to the notion of complicity’ (41).

Aquinas and Kutz both contribute to expanding Mellema’s topic, somewhat awkwardly, beyond its natural boundaries. On another axis, however, Mellema strikes me as having artificially narrowed his topic and thereby relegated it, wrongly, to the sidelines of moral philosophy. He assumes from the start that ‘morally blameless complicity’ is an oxymoron (3). While this assumption does not strictly bar him from discussing justifications and excuses for (what would otherwise be) complicitous actions, it does license him to put these topics ‘beyond the scope of the discussion’ (15). So when questions come up that would usually be thought of as questions of justification or excuse (e.g. duress at 69, moral dilemmas at 81-2), they are rather cursorily parried or bypassed. Largely untreated in the book, therefore, are intriguing (and classic) problems about the moral position of undercover cops, anarchist judges, agents provocateurs, press-ganged conscripts, etc., who contribute to the wrongs of others so as to (as it seems to them) serve some greater good or avoid some terrible evil.

There is a connection here, I think, with Mellema’s paucity of references. It has been a central question of modern moral philosophy whether one could be justified, or at least excused, in contributing to another’s wrongdoing in order to avoid being a principal wrongdoer oneself. Think of Kant’s case of the murderer at the door, Williams’ example of Jim and the Indians, Sen’s story of Ali, Donna, and the bashers, and so on. Should one choose to be A rather than P in such cases, even when all else is equal? Mellema opines that, with some exceptions, Ps are more blameworthy than their counterpart As (5-6). But that question lies a long way downstream from the one that interests Kant, Williams, and Sen. If blameworthiness were the immediate issue for potential accomplices, then folks like Jim and Donna could breathe a sigh of relief. All they need is an excuse to relieve them of blame (as Mellema seems to agree: 15). In their dire situations that excuse will not be hard to find. Since they are deliberating about what to do, however, what Jim and Donna want to know is whether being A rather than P would be justified, not merely excused. Mellema does not isolate this upstream question. That leaves him giving the impression that there has not been much recent philosophical work on complicity, when in fact moral philosophy has been preoccupied with it for decades. On this score, I was struck by the contrast with Chiara Lepora and Robert E. Goodin’s 2013 bookOn Complicity and Compromise(not cited by Mellema) in which puzzles about the ethics of complicity are presented as pervading modern moral and political philosophy, albeit not always under that name (sometimes as ‘the problem of dirty hands’ or ‘the Solzhenitsyn principle’).

In spite of these difficulties with its scope and intellectual horizons, Mellema’s book does give pride of place to what is surely the key question for any study of the ethics of complicity, namely the question of what counts as contributing to another’s wrong. In the two chapters which in my view have the most solid claim to appear in it (chs 4 and 5), Mellema attends to enabling and facilitating contributions respectively. As his economical and lucid remarks nicely bring out, each of these raises puzzles for the idea of a ‘contribution’. If A sells P a rifle that P uses in an assassination, A enables the assassination. But what if there are other dealers around who would have sold P a similar weapon had A not been willing and able to do so? Likewise, if A gives P advice as to the ideal vantage point from which to fire the fatal shot, A facilitates the assassination. But what if, even without A’s advice, P would have found an adequate vantage point? In each case there is clearly a sense in which what A does make a difference to P’s wrongdoing, and another sense in which A doesn’t.

Mellema has sensible thoughts about what the former sense might be and why it would be the one that matters in identifying a complicitous contribution. But his analysis does not delve as deeply as that of some who went before him. It does not, indeed, display much awareness of previous delvings. In particular, there is no mention of the detailed investigations of H.L.A. Hart and A. M. Honoré in their joint bookCausation in the Law(1959, 2nd ed. 1985). True, Hart and Honoré did not venture many views on the ethics of complicity. Their interest lay mainly in the metaphysics — principally, indeed, in the same question that detains Mellema in chapters 4 and 5, the question of how one can be said to contribute to the wrongs of others by facilitating those wrongs, by enabling them, or for that matter by inducing them, encouraging them, permitting them, failing to prevent them, etc. One does not expect Mellema to rival Hart and Honoré for encyclopaedic treatment of these issues. But perhaps one could have wished for some engagement with their work. One might also have hoped for chapters on encouraging, inducing, and some other modes of contribution, to match those on enabling and facilitating. In some ways, as Mellema reveals in scattered, tantalising remarks on the subject, the problem of complicity by encouraging is the most complex and intriguing of them all. And the problem of complicity by failure to prevent, to which Mellema gives repeated but not sustained attention, is perhaps the one with the most far-reaching implications.

Inevitably this review has emphasized some themes of Mellema’s book to the neglect of others. Given more space I might have discussed Mellema’s novel distinction between accomplices who are responsible for the principal’s wrong and accomplices who are merely ‘tainted’ by that wrong (27-9). I might also have discussed his attempt (ch 8) to distinguish breach of moral obligation from disappointment of moral expectation (which is said to be ‘wrong’ yet not ‘forbidden’: 88). I found much to inspire and intrigue as well as to provoke in these passages, as indeed in the whole of the book. To repeat, it is an agreeable and stimulating read. Yet I cannot conceal my frustration that so many issues only ‘tangentially related to the notion of complicity’ vie for the reader’s attention within the short span ofComplicity and Moral Accountability. They do so, it seems to me, at the expense of methodical and tenacious attention to the book’s ostensible topic. Some nonphilosopher readers may thereby come to underestimate the contribution that philosophy has made, and is capable of making, to the study of complicity — and indeed vice versa. For such readers, the Lepore and Goodin book mentioned above would, I believe, be a better place to start. It is just as short and just as replete with memorable examples (theirs mainly concern humanitarian intervention in conflict zones, which is Lepore’s day job). However, Lepore and Goodin do a better job than Mellema of sticking to the advertised topic and locating it correctly (namely: dead centre) on the map of modern moral and political philosophy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman develops an account of shared intentional activity grounded in individual intentions that interlock in specific ways. For shared cooperative activity, each participant must intend that they perform the joint action together, these intentions must be common knowledge, and each must be committed to supporting the other's role in the shared plan. This avoids positing irreducible collective mental states while explaining genuine joint action.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a framework for understanding delegation as a form of shared agency. When one delegates, one may still share intentions with the delegate (intending that we together accomplish the goal), rather than simply causing the delegate to act. This distinguishes morally loaded delegation (shared agency) from mere causal manipulation (using another as a tool).

You and I might sing a duet together, paint a house together, take a trip together, build something together, or run a give-and-gol together in a basketball game. In many such cases ours will be a shared cooperative activity. Such shared cooperative activities can involve large numbers of participating agents and can take place within a complex institutional frameworkconsider the activities of a symphony orchestra following its conductor. But to keep things simple I will focus here on shared cooperative activities that involve only a pair of participating agents and are not the activities of complex institutions with structures of authority. Shared cooperative activity (SCA) involves, of course, appropriate behaviors. If you and I successfully engage in the SCA of painting the house together then, of course, we paint the house together. But we might paint the house together without acting cooperatively. Perhaps neither of us even knows of the other's activities, or though we each know of the other's activities neither of us cares. Given appropriate behaviors, what else is needed for ours to be a SCA? Suppose that you and I sing a duet together, and that this is a SCA. I will be trying to be responsive to your intentions and actions, knowing that you will be trying to be responsive to my intentions and actions. This mutual responsiveness will be in the pursuit of a goal we each have, namely, our singing the duet. You may have this goal for different reasons than I do; but at the least we will each have this as a goal. Finally, I will not merely stand back},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman extends his earlier work on shared intentionality into a comprehensive planning theory of shared agency. He defends the view that shared agency emerges from interlocking individual intentions and shared policies, without requiring collective agents or irreducible "we-intentions." The framework accommodates hierarchical shared agency (including some forms of authority and delegation) while preserving individual rational agency.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how delegation can preserve shared agency. When a principal delegates to an agent within a framework of interlocking intentions and shared policies, the outcome may still reflect the principal's agency (though distributed through the relationship). This bears on whether delegated accomplishments can carry the same moral weight as individually performed ones.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schmitz and Bryson argue against the notion that AI systems create inevitable "ethics sinks" (structures that facilitate dissipation of responsibility). They propose a three-point framework for legitimate AI integration: (1) maintain clear human accountability lines, (2) ensure humans can verify AI system functioning, and (3) introduce AI only where it enhances transparency and legitimacy. AI should be treated as tools for organizational transparency, not as independent moral agents.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses responsibility in contexts where tasks are delegated to AI systems rather than human agents. The framework's insistence on maintaining human accountability lines suggests that technological delegation need not create responsibility gaps if properly structured. However, this leaves open whether choosing to delegate to AI rather than perform tasks oneself has intrinsic moral significance beyond accountability concerns.

In particular, perception or actuality of AI agency might create ethics sinks - constructs that facilitate dissipation of responsibility when AI systems of disputed moral status interface with bureaucratic structures. Here, we reject the notion that ethics sinks are a necessary consequence of introducing AI systems into bureaucracies. Rather, where they appear, they are the product of structural design decisions across both the technology and the institution deploying it. We support this claim via a systematic application of conceptions of moral agency in AI ethics to Weberian bureaucracy. We establish that it is both desirable and feasible to render AI systems as tools for the generation of organizational transparency and legibility, which continue the processes of Weberian rationalization initiated by previous waves of digitalization. We present a three-point Moral Agency Framework for legitimate integration of AI in bureaucratic structures: (a) maintain clear and just human lines of accountability, (b) ensure humans whose work is augmented by AI systems can verify the systems are functioning correctly, and (c) introduce AI only where it doesn't inhibit the capacity of bureaucracies towards either of their twin aims of legitimacy and stewardship. We suggest that AI introduced within this framework can not only improve efficiency and productivity while avoiding ethics sinks, but also improve the transparency and even the legitimacy of a bureaucracy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Following Floridi's concept of distributed morality, Glukhovskii argues that AI systems should be understood as heterogeneous sociotechnical systems with both human and non-human agents. He adapts Floridi's patient-oriented ethics, shifting focus from action subjects to affected parties. This framework distributes responsibility across all agents in the system, human and non-human alike, based on their causal roles in producing morally significant effects.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a framework for understanding responsibility when tasks are delegated to AI systems. Rather than locating responsibility solely with human designers, users, or the AI itself, distributed responsibility assigns accountability to each agent based on their contribution. This complicates the delegation question: who bears responsibility for outcomes when both human and AI agents contribute?

  abstract = {The main goal of the article is to justify the optimality of Luciano Floridi’s concept of dis­tributed morality for describing a model of the relationship of responsibility in complex hu­man – AI systems. The high level of its autonomy in functioning does not correspond to the classical instrumentalist approach to technology, as it turns out to be capable of funda­mentally uncontrollable actions in the process of performing the task assigned to it. For the same reason, the classical definition of moral responsibility does not adequately corre­spond to the actual situation in the field of artificial intelligence development, which often leads to problems that hinder the development of this technology. Therefore, the article con­ceptualizes a new technology-appropriate way of describing the relationship of responsibil­ity in the field of artificial intelligence ethics. To achieve this goal artificial intelligence is considered as a participant in various interactions, including social ones, possessing agency, but at the same time as not attributed with true intentionality, motivation, awareness and other properties that are necessary for attributing agency in the classical model of the rela­tionship of responsibility. In addition to referring to Floridi’s description of agency criteria, the justification of such a consideration of AI is based on Annamarie Mol and Marianne de Laet’s concept of fluidity which is developed by them, among others, to denote the ability of technologies to possess agency without having the properties considered necessary for at­tributing agency in the classical model of the role of technologies in social processes. AI technology is analyzed as a complex heterogeneous sociotechnical system made up of both human and non-human agents. The risk of leveling the significance of responsibility in such a system is overcome at the conceptual level by adapting the approach of Floridi’s patient-oriented morality. Changing the emphasis from the subject of action to the object of influence gives moral significance to the entire sum of morally neutral actions that are performed by agents within the framework of a sociotechnical system. Since it produces morally significant effects and impacts, it also acts as a bearer of the relation of responsibi­lity which, as shown in the article, applies to each agent of the system equally thereby inten­sifying moral responsibility in the field of AI.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Xia proposes a framework based on externalist agency and distributed responsibility to address responsibility gaps created by autonomous AI systems. Agency is treated as gradient (not all-or-nothing), with intermediate levels including distributed agency, constrained agency, and derivative agency. Responsibility should be allocated according to these gradients, with both humans and artifacts bearing responsibility based on their degree of agency.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a nuanced framework for assessing responsibility when humans delegate tasks to increasingly autonomous AI systems. By treating agency and responsibility as matters of degree, Xia's framework accommodates cases where neither the human principal nor the AI agent bears full responsibility.

In this dilemma, moral undesirable consequences arise from technology, yet no one is held accountable because individuals lack control over their actions and their outcomes, as well as the ability to predict these outcomes, rendering them morally blameless. This paper proposes a framework based on externalist agency and distributed responsibility, aiming to address this problem by assigning accountability to artifacts. Externalist agency holds that agency is a gradient concept rather than an all-or-nothing one. Between fully autonomous agency and non-agency, there are three intermediate gradients: distributed agency, constrained agency, and derivative agency. Distributed responsibility holds that responsibility should be allocated according to these gradients of agency. For both humans and artifacts: if an agent possesses derivative agency, forgiveness is warranted; if it possesses distributed agency, punishment is justifiable. This paper further suggests that punishment for artifacts can take the form of punishment for technological lineage—that is, modifying the design of technologies to guide their evolution toward safer and more ethical directions.},

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a strategic dimension of delegation: can principals avoid responsibility by delegating to agents they have structured to be morally incapacitated? Lambrecht's attributability requirement suggests that strategic delegation to escape responsibility fails if the delegation itself reflects the principal's agency. This bears on the moral evaluation of choosing organizational structures that diffuse responsibility.

Self-induced moral incapacity seems to introduce a responsibility gap that corporate agents might exploit to avoid responsibility. De Haan argues that the problem does not introduce responsibility gaps because collective moral agents become responsible for actions they committed while they were incapacitated once they reacquire moral capacity. I argue that de Haan’s argument is incomplete. Simply because a group reacquires moral capacity does not also necessarily mean that the group retains attributability for the wrongs in question. This means we must supplement de Haan’s argument with an Attributability Proviso: To overcome the problem of self-induced moral incapacity it must be the case that the group reacquires moral capacity and that we can still attribute the earlier actions to the group despite the changes that it has gone through.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schwenkenbecher examines whether corporations, like psychopaths, lack capacities constitutive of moral agency.

Unlike psychopaths' inherent deficits, corporate irrationality is chosen or permitted.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether delegating decision-making to corporate structures (which may lack moral emotions) diminishes responsibility.

Psychopaths are often thought to lack some of the capacities that are constitutive of moral agency. Two features of psychopaths are commonly identified as grounds for limiting their moral responsibility: (i) their lack of relevant emotional capacities and (ii) their flawed rational capacities. Roughly, the first argument is that the lack of moral emotions such as sympathy, guilt, or shame negatively impacts moral perception and therewith an agent's capacity for moral reasoning. The second argument is that psychopaths are diminished in their agency as such, not just in their moral agency; they are erratic and impulsive and show other significant failures of rationality. Using the 2020 Juukan Gorge disaster in Western Australia as a case study, I conclude that deliberate or reckless corporate irrationality cannot be grounds for diminished corporate moral responsibility. Corporate agents are chiefly responsible for core aspects of their moral agency, including their internal epistemic structures and decision‐making processes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Blomberg reviews Mellema's work on complicity, highlighting the distinction between sharing responsibility for an outcome versus being blameworthy for one's contributory action. An accomplice to wrongdoing is always blameworthy for their contribution, but whether they share responsibility for the outcome depends on the nature of their contribution. Blomberg also discusses "moral taint"—negative effects on moral status from association with wrongdoing, even without responsibility for the outcome.

  RELEVANCE: Distinguishes between responsibility for outcomes and blameworthiness for participation, crucial for evaluating delegation. When one delegates tasks to others who perform wrongful acts, one may be blameworthy for the delegation decision even if not responsible for the ultimate outcome. The concept of "moral taint" suggests association through delegation can affect moral standing even without full responsibility.

He also examines related phenomena such as collective and shared responsibility, as well as enabling, facilitating, and condoning harm produced by others. An agent is an accomplice to a principal agent’s wrongdoing if she contributes to the outcome in certain ways. According to Mellema, she must not only perform some kind of contributory action or intentionally omit to perform an action. She must also be aware of the principal agent’s wrongdoing. An accomplice may share in the responsibility for the outcome of the principal agent’s wrongdoing. In part, whether she does share in it depends on the nature of the contributory action or omission. In the absence of a valid excuse, she is also always morally blameworthy for her contributory action or omission itself. Mellema draws on Thomas Aquinas’ discussion of “accessory sins” to characterise different kinds of contributory actions or omissions. As Mellema plausibly argues, these accessory sins can be understood as ways in which one can become complicit in someone else’s wrongdoing. For example, one can become complicit in another’s wrongdoing in virtue of commanding, counselling, or encouraging them with respect to their wrongdoing, or in virtue of consenting to, not denouncing, or in participating in their wrong doing. If I merely encourage you to shoplift, then I am normally not responsible for the shopkeeper’s loss after your theft, but if I rather actively participate in your shoplifting by distracting the security guard as you stuff your pockets, then I am also responsible for the shopkeeper’s loss. Drawing on Appiah’s (1991) work, Mellema argues that in the former kind of case, an accomplice can nevertheless be “morally tainted” by a wrongdoing even if she is not responsible for it. This moral taint effects her moral status negatively in virtue of her being associated or related to the principal agent is certain ways. Mellema illustrates the idea of moral taint with an example case taken from Kutz (2000, pp. 163–164).

I consider two challenges to the claim that humans can realise the kind of control required for moral responsibility. First, an empirical challenge from cognitive neuroscience provides a familiar way to argue against the realisation of the choice aspect by human psychology. Second, a more formidable conceptual challenge to the aspect of agenthood presents us with scepticism about the kind of explanations that psychology can provide. The second challenge suggests that, in psychological accounts of choice, the agent disappears. Drawing on recent empirical models of cognitive control and philosophical accounts of agency, I conclude that the psychological explanation of choice is consistent with the aspect of agenthood being realised by human psychology.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cognitive offloading is paradigmatically intentional action, yet debates about extended cognition ignore this fact. Opposition to extended cognition stems partly from unarticulated intuitions about agency rooted in Davidson's interface model (intentions cause bodily movements). An Anscombean model of action—where actions express intentions only within appropriate teleologically structured contexts—better supports extended cognition by recognizing agency's general dependence on bodily and environmental settings.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how action theory shapes views of cognitive offloading. If offloading is genuine action (not mere causal enablement), then delegating to tools is doing something oneself in a different form. This challenges views that treat tool use as diminishing agency. The Anscombean framework suggests that doing things yourself doesn't require keeping all processes internal—what matters is the teleological structure integrating agent, body, and environment. Illuminates DIY questions about when using tools counts as doing it yourself.

  POSITION: Extended mind proponent using Anscombean action theory to defend cognitive offloading as genuine agency.

  abstract = {The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on ‘cognitive offloading’, HEC’s defenders claim that information processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is sometimes ‘genuinely’ cognitive. But while debates about offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of action as a kind of interface between separately constituted intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic. But while this view of agency has been popularised – most prominently by Donald Davidson – as analytic philosophy of action’s ‘standard story’, it has come under pressure from philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe’s very different account. According to this, actions express an agent’s intention only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically structured worldly context. In this paper, I’ll argue that HEC’s supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is, they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of human agency’s general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Excessive cognitive offloading to gadgets threatens intellectual autonomy, particularly the freedom to achieve intellectual goals independently. While offloading can enhance efficiency, overdependence undermines the capacity for autonomous intellectual achievement.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditional extended mind theory assumes tool transparency (expert tool use involves phenomenological disappearance of the tool). However, smart technologies with AI-based applications resist transparency—they "reappear" in conscious experience because their autonomous behavior requires monitoring. This challenges whether contemporary smart technology can extend the mind in the classical sense and raises questions about design goals for AI systems.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies how AI and smart technology differ from traditional tools regarding extended cognition. If smart tools inherently resist transparency, this affects whether using AI counts as extending the self versus delegating to an external agent. The "reappearing tool" phenomenon suggests AI-assisted action differs phenomenologically and possibly morally from traditional tool use.

This is a claim that may be traced to phenomenological philosophers such as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, but it has been influential in user interface design where the transparency of technology has often been adopted as a mark of good design. Moreover, in the philosophy of cognitive science, such transparency has been advanced as necessary for extended cognition (the situation in which the technology with which we couple genuinely counts as a constitutive part of our cognitive machinery, along with our brains). By reflecting on concrete examples of our contemporary engagement with technology, I shall argue that the epistemic challenges posed by smart artefacts (those that come equipped with artificial-intelligence-based applications) should prompt a reassessment of the drive for transparency in the design of some cases of technology-involving cognition. This has consequences for the place of extended minds in the contemporary technological context.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Brain-computer interfaces (neuromedia) that enable cognitive offloading threaten intellectual perseverance—the virtue of mentally persisting through challenges toward intellectual goals. Excessive offloading incentivized by neuromedia undermines virtue development by removing the challenges that cultivate perseverance. However, responsible use might reallocate perseverance to more valuable intellectual pursuits by eliminating menial cognitive labor.

  RELEVANCE: Extends virtue epistemology critique of offloading to future technologies.

Then, I examine the cognitive offloading argument as it applies to the virtue of intellectual perseverance, arguing that neuromedia may increase cognitive efficiency at the cost of intellectual perseverance.

The agency discussion addresses when offloading to technology genuinely extends the self versus creating vulnerability to external control.

Eliminating moral struggle through technology doesn't undermine progress and may enable it by freeing cognitive resources.

Relevant to DIY questions because it challenges the assumption that doing things yourself (morally deliberating, resisting temptation) is intrinsically valuable.

First, technologies to improve people’s moral capacities are realizable. Second, such technologies will actually help people get morality right and behave more consistently with whatever the ‘real’ right thing to do turns out to be. The paper then considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable, particularly opportunities for moral progress, when being moral is made much easier by eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle.

Technomoral revolutions involve complex interactions between material affordances and moral systems.

Does technology have a similarly transformative influence on societies’ morality? Scholars have not rigorously investigated the role of technology in moral revolutions, even though existing research on technomoral change suggests that this role may be considerable. In this paper, we explore what the role of technology in moral revolutions, understood as processes of radical group-level moral change, amounts to. We do so by investigating four historical episodes of radical moral change in which technology plays a noteworthy role. Our case-studies illustrate the plurality of mechanisms involved in technomoral revolutions, but also suggest general patterns of technomoral change, such as technology’s capacity to stabilize and destabilize moral systems, and to make morally salient phenomena visible or invisible. We find several leads to expand and refine conceptual tools for analysing moral change, specifically by crystallizing the notions of ‘technomoral niche construction’ and ‘moral payoff mechanisms’. Coming to terms with the role of technology in radical moral change, we argue, enriches our understanding of moral revolutions, and alerts us to the depths of which technology can change our societies in wanted and unwanted ways.},

  abstract = {The present collection of essays contains illuminating discussions of a range of issues around cognition, self and agency. The introduction, written by Don Ross, has the title "Science Catches the Will", and this title provides a good clue to the focal point of the collection and also to the conception of the terrain we find in many of the essays; there is something here we ought to catch, and we ought to catch it by a scientific approach. Putting things like this, we immediately invite a number of further questions, among them questions about what the will is supposed to be, what central philosophers have thought that it is, what science is, and whether science thus understood carries the right approach to the major aspects of the questions raised. That in its turn brings up general questions about the relationship between science and philosophy. While there is no doubt that good philosophy is in deep need of being informed by and fully responsive to developments in science, there is a similar requirement that scientists approaching philosophical issues be responsive to the state of the art and to the nature of the philosophical problems. There are no sharp lines between science and philosophy; the important thing is always to know what you are doing and to do it well.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

There are fourteen good essays here, and the collection is an outgrowth of interaction over some time. The authors are mainly philosophers, all of them with wide interests in neighboring disciplines, many of them with research contributions of great significance in a much wider field than what is called philosophy. Some of the contributors are not professional philosophers; their work is nevertheless philosophical in nature and/or of great relevance to philosophical theorizing.

Looking back at the last fifty years of philosophy of mind and action, we see Davidson and Anscombe as very important contributors to work on and about the will at the beginning of this period. We see them engaging with questions about the will as it was conceived of by earlier philosophers, and we see both agreements and disagreement between them. The present collection starts from Davidson, and many contributors see him as someone who attempted to make room for naturalism by seeing reasons as causes, and, as one contributor, Miriam Thalos, puts it, "He sought to do justice to the idea of agency as ownership over behavior, while nonetheless preserving a basis for some semblance of a science of action" (p. 125 in her essay "The Sources of Behavior"). This idea of ownership is developed like this: "What is mine about a piece of behavior, among the scientifically minded nowadays, is the pro attitude that I direct towards it, in the form of a mental state" (p. 126).

Thalos, in her essay, builds her own position partly by contrasting her views with Davidson's. In particular, she argues against Davidson by trying to undermine what she calls his motivationalism. She presents a simple principle she sees as closely connected with Davidson's principles, and provides a counterexample to it. Her principle states that if you intend to do something, you are able to do it; if no new considerations arise, and you are not prevented from doing it, then you do it.

Of course there are counterexamples to this simple principle, and she provides one where you get lost in thought while driving away to do shopping, and arrive at your workplace instead of at the store. She foresees a Davidsonian response; that arriving at your workplace was not an intentional action. Davidson, when accounting for agency, was aiming for an account of doing something intentionally. Davidson only wants to be committed to the view that you in fact go for the act you want most if you intentionally carry out one of the acts you consider. Therefore, this counterexample to Thalos's principle might not undermine Davidson's position; he might have no reason to think her principle is true or something that is entailed by his views. Thalos holds such a reply to be "unworthy and implausible" (p. 130), since arriving at the workplace was an action in the present example.

Here, it seems to me, Davidson has a further reply that is not an implausible one. Arriving at the workplace was an action also on his account: the result of many "smaller" things we did intentionally while driving. There are on Davidson's picture many things we do in virtue of doing something else. Sometimes we do indeed intend to do A, get lost in thought, do many things intentionally, but fail to do A, and do B instead. Then doing B is an action, but not necessarily something we do intentionally; it might be an unintended result of doing many other things intentionally. It seems to me that this reply works for this case, and that Davidson avoids this particular criticism from Thalos.

There is, I think, a genuine issue about how good the Davidsonian approach is at providing understanding in cases of routine, cases where we act on "auto-pilot", but that is a different matter from the question of whether his account of agency and of doing something intentionally faces a real problem from this particular type of counterexample.

What seems to be happening throughout Thalos's extremely rich essay is that she is pursuing a theory of agency that is different in scope from that considered by Davidson, Anscombe, and others. She also pursues very many dimensions of agency, and is instructively inspired by Michael Bratman. If, however, agency is not restricted to what we do intentionally, many of the problems look very different, and so do the connections between reasons and actions in the account of agency. To illustrate: Davidson gave up giving necessary and sufficient conditions for agency because of the possibility of deviant causal chains. Thalos does not really discuss deviance, and maybe this indicates that the focus has shifted. Maybe her notion of agency does not face this problem at all, with the consequence that the climber who lets the rope go, startled by the thought that this is a possibility, acts in her sense of acting (or exhibiting agency) without intentionally letting the rope go.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended mind theory has developed through three waves. First wave (parity principle): if external plays same role as internal, it's cognitive. Second wave (complementarity): external resources need not replicate internal processes but complement them. Third wave (predictive processing + enactivism): extended cognition emerges from prediction-driven dynamics. Each wave solves problems with previous approaches but faces new challenges.

  RELEVANCE: Surveys evolution of extended mind theory and current state of debates. The three-wave framework helps locate different arguments about cognitive offloading. First wave supports strong extension claims; second wave allows looser integration; third wave emphasizes dynamical embodied processes. Relevant to DIY questions because different waves have different implications for when tool use extends versus outsources cognition—affects whether using AI counts as doing things yourself.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Internet search engines affect intellectual character and virtue development. Excessive reliance on search can undermine memory, intellectual perseverance, and open-mindedness by providing easy answers and algorithmic filtering. However, skillful search use can enhance intellectual virtues by providing diverse perspectives and epistemic resources. Educational practices should cultivate virtuous search habits.

  RELEVANCE: Applies virtue epistemology to specific technology (search engines). Identifies how cognitive offloading to search affects intellectual character—relevant to whether technological delegation undermines or enables virtue. The dual potential (undermining or enhancing virtue depending on use) suggests context and skill matter more than offloading per se. Relevant to DIY questions about whether using search differs morally from consulting human experts or doing research yourself.

Virtue epistemology focusses on the cognitive character of agents and is less concerned with the nature of truth and epistemic justification as compared to traditional analytic epistemology. Due to this focus on cognitive character and agency, it is a fruitful but underexplored approach to using the Internet in an epistemically desirable way. Thus, the central question in this paper is: How to use the Internet in an epistemically virtuous way? Using the work of Jason Baehr, it starts by outlining nine intellectual or epistemic virtues: curiosity, intellectual autonomy, intellectual humility, attentiveness, intellectual carefulness, intellectual thoroughness, open-mindedness, intellectual courage and intellectual tenacity. It then explores how we should deploy these virtues and avoid the corresponding vices when interacting with the Internet, particularly search engines. Whilst an epistemically virtuous use of the Internet will not guarantee that one will acquire true beliefs, understanding or even knowledge, it will strongly improve one’s information-seeking behaviours. The paper ends with arguing that teaching and assessing online intellectual virtues should be part of school and university curricula, perhaps embedded in critical thinking courses, or even better, as individual units.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: The skill model of virtue faces a dilemma: ordinary skills provide
  a plausible model of practical reason only insofar as they are assessed by

  and virtues differ fundamentally regarding standards of assessment, this weakens
  claims that DIY activity is constitutive of virtue in the way skill practice is
  constitutive of skill acquisition.

To that end, some theorists invoke the skill model of virtue, according to which virtue involves essentially the same kind of practical reason as ordinary skills. I contend, however, that ordinary skills provide a plausible and informative model of good practical reason only insofar as they are assessed by agent-independent standards. And so virtue, likewise, must be assessed primarily by agent-independent moral standards, if the skill model is to serve its purpose.

Here, I raise a new challenge for those who go in for the (s)kill against situationism. Expert skills are brittle , rather than flexible or robust. They typically develop in narrow ways and can falter in novel situations. Experts also sometimes perform worse than novices in novel situations. Such findings present a problem for the virtue-as-skill thesis. Someone who will help others only in narrow contexts or who causes more harm than good does not exemplify virtue. The brittleness of expert skills means that virtue theorists must either (a) abandon the idea that virtues explain behaviour across contexts or (b) abandon the idea that virtues are expert skills.

This conceptualization resonates with philosophical virtue theories as much as it converges with psychological models about skill development, expertise, goal motivation, and self-regulation. Yet, the conceptualization of virtue as skill acquisition poses the crucial question of motivation: What motivates individuals to self-improve over time so that they can learn from past experience, correct mistakes, and expand their ethical knowledge to new and unfamiliar circumstances? In this paper, it is argued that the motivation to increase one’s level of skillfulness in leading a virtuous life is supported by a specific identity goal, namely the goal to be a moral person. However, this moral identity goal needs to carry specific goal characteristics in order to effectively provide this motivation. It needs to be sufficiently abstract, internally motivated and promotion- rather than prevention-oriented. Research in developmental psychology suggests that the moral identity of children is rather concrete, externally motivated, and prevention-oriented. With development, higher levels of abstraction, internal motivation, and promotion-orientation gain importance providing an important motivational basis for a self-regulated process of virtue acquisition.},

Wisdom is integrated with, and builds upon, habituation: the acquisition of virtuous character traits through the repeated practice of corresponding virtuous actions. Habit formation equips people with a taste for, and commitment to, the good life; furthermore it provides one with discriminatory and reflective capacities to know how to act in particular circumstances. Unfortunately, habituation is often understood primarily as a method suitable only for children. This article examines whether Aristotle limited habituation to children and, if not, what the relationship between habituation and wisdom beyond childhood might look like.

First, to offer a critical review of the literatures on two well-known single-component solutions to the problem of a gap between moral knowledge and moral action: moral identity and moral emotions. Second, to take seriously the rising interest in Aristotle-inspired virtue ethics and character development within the social sciences: approaches that seem to assume that the development of phronesis (practical wisdom) bridges the gap in question. Since phronesis is a multicomponent construct, the latter part of this article offers an overview of what those different components would be, as a necessary precursor to operationalising them if the phronesis hypothesis were to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. The idea of a neo-Aristotelian multicomponent solution to the “gappiness problem” invites comparisons with another multicomponent candidate, the neo-Kohlbergian four-component model, with which it shares at least surface similarities. Some space is thus devoted to the proposed theoretical uniqueness of a phronesis-based multicomponent model vis-à-vis the neo-Kohlbergian one. Our main conclusion is that – weaknesses in its developmental psychological grounding notwithstanding – operationalising the phronesis model for the purposes of instrument design and empirical inquiry would be a feasible and potentially productive enterprise.},

I argue that the skill analogy needs to be extended to account for the fact that in order to develop fully, phronesis requires direct teaching about the nature of the well-rounded life, providing the learner with an indirect blueprint for eudaimonia.

It provides a new, comprehensive account of the physiological underpinnings of moral development and thereby shows, first, that Aristotle’s ethical theories do not exhaust his views about character, as has traditionally been assumed, and, second, that his treatment of natural character in the biological treatises provides the conceptual and ideological foundation for his views about habituation as developed in his ethics. This manuscript thus takes seriously Aristotle’s claim—often ignored—that nature is one of the factors through which men become “good and capable of fine deeds.” Part I (“The Physiology and Science of Natural Character”) analyzes, in three chapters, Aristotle’s notion of natural character as it is developed in the biological treatises and its role in moral development, especially as it affects women and certain “barbarians”—groups who are typically left out of accounts of Aristotle’s ethics. I also discuss its relevance for our understanding of physiognomical ideas in Aristotle. Part II (“The Physiology of Moral Development”) explores the psychophysical changes in body and soul that one is required to undergo in the process of acquiring moral virtues.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights how virtue development requires personal experience of
  failure and learning from mistakes - a process that necessarily involves doing
  things yourself. You cannot develop robust virtue by having others shield you from
  failure or perform challenging actions on your behalf; direct engagement including
  failures is pedagogically essential.

  POSITION: Virtue-as-skill model; emphasizes role of emotion regulation and learning
  from failure in virtue acquisition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The skill model of virtue requires a non-dualistic conception of

  are both automatic and embedded in intelligent practice. Emotions contribute

  practice into skillful components of virtue. Suggests emotional cultivation through
  experience is part of what makes direct practice essential for virtue - you develop
  appropriate emotional responses by engaging with situations yourself, not just by

Part I identifies global challenges for the human family presented by emerging technologies and the rapid cultural and institutional shifts they trigger, presenting the philosophical tradition of virtue ethics as the most promising practical resource for learning how to cope with, and even flourish in, our increasingly uncertain and risky technosocial condition. Part II finds guidance for this ambition in the classical virtue traditions of Aristotle, Confucianism, and Buddhism, which offer practical frameworks for the cultivation of virtue that resonate even across cultural and historical boundaries. Part II also explores the basic structure of this human practice and how it might be adapted for contemporary technosocial life, and concludes with an account of twelve technomoral virtues, the global cultivation of which represents humanity’s best and perhaps only chance of having a future worth wanting. Part III applies this account of technomoral virtue to four emerging technologies that are radically reshaping the human condition: new social media, digital surveillance, robotics, and biomedical enhancement. The risks and opportunities for human flourishing created by these technologies can only be managed by the wider cultivation of those virtues, which together constitute technomoral wisdom.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational edited collection introduces relational autonomy as a feminist reconceptualization of autonomy that rejects atomistic conceptions of the self. Contributors argue that autonomy is compatible with—and may even require—social relationships and embeddedness. The introduction distinguishes causally relational accounts (relationships support autonomy development) from constitutively relational accounts (social conditions partly define autonomy), and procedural from substantive approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding feminist critiques of self-reliance as an individualistic ideal. If autonomy requires supportive relationships rather than independence, then DIY self-sufficiency may not be the autonomy-enhancing ideal it appears. The volume establishes that dependence and autonomy need not conflict, directly challenging valorization of doing things oneself.

Mackenzie argues that relational autonomy theories illuminate how oppressive social contexts undermine autonomy and show why individualistic conceptions fail to capture constraints faced by marginalized groups.

  RELEVANCE: Recent restatement of relational autonomy's significance by a key founder of the approach. Emphasizes how oppressive social conditions—not just internal psychological states—constrain autonomy. This suggests that individualistic DIY ethics may fail to recognize structural constraints and that accepting support from communities can be autonomy-enabling rather than autonomy-undermining.

We genuinely do lack autonomy in oppressive social conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Recent defense of relational autonomy against Khader's critique. Argues that recognizing social constraints on autonomy is not paternalistic but realistic.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Nedelsky argues that traditional liberal autonomy is grounded in a conception of property and boundaries that emphasizes separation from others. She proposes reconceiving autonomy not as self-sufficiency but as self-determination within relationships.

This undermines moral valorization of DIY self-reliance—if autonomy is enabled by relationships, accepting help may manifest rather than undermine autonomy.

She argues that traditional autonomy theory ignores how gender socialization and oppression constrain self-determination. Friedman defends autonomy as still valuable for women but argues it must be reconceived to acknowledge social embeddedness.

  RELEVANCE: Influential book-length treatment of relational autonomy with attention to gender oppression. Relevant to DIY because it questions whether women's traditional care work reflects autonomy deficits or different forms of self-determination. If care and interdependence are compatible with autonomy, DIY individualism may devalue relational forms of agency. Procedural approach allows that accepting help can be autonomous.

  abstract = {In her recent book, Amy Allen tackles one of the persistent problems of post-Foucaultian critical theory: how can we acknowledge the pervasive mechanisms of power in the formation of our identities, and yet still allow for an ideal of autonomous action? This problem -- one that has been a sticking point in the discussion between Foucaultians and Habermasians -- has also come to be an issue of much importance in the feminist literature.The Politics of Our Selvesis a persuasive and well-reasoned account of how we might find our way through some difficult -- some might say 'intractable' -- problems of contemporary feminism and critical theory. The book demonstrates that the perceived opposition between power and knowledge is something of a red herring. Recognizing this, moreover, has important consequences for some of feminism's most serious debates -- as well as for understanding the appropriate parameters of a critical theory.

The Politics of Our Selvesbegins by rethinking the Foucault/Habermas debate -- a debate that centers on the place of critique in the network of power. In reading Foucault's work, where power 'is everywhere' and is that in virtue of which agents are constructed and placed within systems of normalization and subordination, a persistent worry seems to arise: if power is absolutely everywhere, how is it possible to engage in the critique of power in such a way that we might (at least partially) liberate ourselves from the oppressive aspects of power? If power pervades everything, it follows that it pervades rationality, and hence that the use of rationality itself is riddled with the very means of subordination we are trying to overcome. It is precisely this criticism that has been leveled against the Foucaultian enterprise by philosophers like Habermas and Charles Taylor.

It is in this debate that Allen makes her first significant contribution to our thinking through the relation of power and knowledge with an eye to the possibility of transformative critique. In Chapters 2 and 3, Allen aims to show that Foucault's analysis of power has been (largely) misunderstood as the repudiation of critique, when in fact Foucault's work is acall to critique:

What Foucault is calling for is a critique of critique, which means not only a criticism of Kant's project for the way in which it closes off the very opening for thought that it had created but also a critiquein the Kantian sense of the term --that is, an interrogation of the limits and conditions of possibility of that which Kant himself took as his own starting point, namely, the transcendental subject. (35)

Foucault's aim is thus, in essence, an attempt to up the ante of critical theory: instead of assuming the capacity of a pure rationality, embedded in a power-free subject, to determine what is and should be, Foucault wants to critically analyze the very notion of subjectivity in the historical conditions which produce it. This by no means entails that critique is no longer possible. Rather, it entails that critique, if it is to be worthy of the name, must be sensitive to the historical forces at work on our own capacities to be selves and our ability to achieve autonomy. Once we have reconceived Foucault's endeavor in this manner, it becomes much easier to see that "the differences between Habermas's and Foucault's projects have been seriously overstated" (42). Allen's analysis, I think, marks a significant advance in the way we should understand the tension between Foucault and Habermas. The 'stand off' between these philosophers is rightly revealed as a distraction, the importance of which has been overblown on all sides. As is so often the case, what is required to get past a dispute is not dogmatic posturing, butnuance.Allen's reading of Foucault and Habermas brings this in spades, resulting in a much more persuasive understanding of the tension between Foucault and Habermas as based primarily on misunderstanding.

Understanding the Foucault/Habermas debate as resting on a misconception both of Foucault's relation to critique, on the one hand, and Habermas's own notion of the relation of reason and power (which Allen examines in Chapter 5), on the other, allows Allen to make a major step forward in the project ofThe Politics of Our Selves: namely, "to figure out how to understand autonomy such that it is compatible with an understanding of power in all its depth and complexity" (21). This, in turn, makes it possible to consider the relevance of power/knowledge to some particular debates in critical theory in general, and feminism in particular.

One such debate concerns the importance of power in the construction of sex and gender, and how getting beyond sex/gender might be accomplished. If power is pervasive and constitutive of identity, it looks as though abandoning gendered identity might amount to abandoningidentity as such, at least given our currentepisteme(to use a Foucaultian term). Butler (and other feminists) have criticized the view that a recognition of the contingency and plasticity of gender constructions is sufficient to eliminate them. This view ignores the power of such constructions over us. Indeed, it ignores that these constructionsareus. The problem, fundamentally, is that it is onlythroughsuch power-laden constructions that we have an identity. Forced to choose between having an identity that subjugates and having no identity at all, individuals choose to carry on the very sex/gender constructions that have hitherto oppressed them.

Judith Butler's important analysis, however, goes too far. Yet another virtue of Allen's book is to show us why this is the case, and to demonstrate that acknowledging the precarious position of sexed/gendered-identity can actually facilitate a more thoughtful approach to the intersection of power and autonomy. Butler claims thatallidentity is essentially subjugated in virtue of simplybeing bornand hence depending onthe recognition of others. This involves forcing us, in the very process of becoming individuals, to accept extrinsic social requirements in order to be recognized by those whose love we need and desire. As Allen shows, however, this view conflates "dependence and subordination" (84). When we see this, we recognize the possibility of "momentsof mutual recognition … within on-going, dynamically unfolding, social relationships" (91). This, then, allows us to see that we can have our identities, constituted as they are by recognition, in a way that need not involve subjugation, despite the fact that "there is no possible human social world from which power has been completely eliminated" (91). Any conception of the social that does not acknowledge the problems and prospects of such mutual recognition -- recognition that can be transformative -- will ultimately be too narrow.},

  RELEVANCE: Foundational communitarian critique of liberal individualism. Challenges the ideal of the self-made, self-sufficient individual who chooses all commitments. For DIY ethics, Sandel suggests that valorizing self-reliance may reflect a flawed conception of the self.

Sandel locates modern liberalism in the tradition of Kant, and focuses on its most influential recent expression in the work of John Rawls.

  abstract = {Abstract The book presents the ethics of care as a promising alternative to more familiar moral theories. The ethics of care is only a few decades old, yet it has become a distinct moral theory or normative approach, relevant to global and political matters as well as to the personal relations that can most clearly exemplify care. The book examines the central ideas, characteristics, and potential importance of the ethics of care. It discusses the feminist roots of this moral approach and why the ethics of care can be a morality with universal appeal. The book explores what is meant by "care" and what a caring person is like. Where such other moral theories as Kantian morality and utilitarianism demand impartiality above all, the ethics of care understands the moral import of ties to families and groups. It evaluates such ties, differing from virtue ethics by focusing on caring relations rather than the virtues of individuals. The book proposes how values such as justice, equality, and individual rights can "fit together" with values such as care, trust, mutual consideration, and solidarity. In considering the potential of the ethics of care for dealing with social issues, the book shows how the ethics of care is more promising than other moral theories for advice on how limited or expansive markets should be, showing how values other than market ones should have priority in such activities as childcare, health care, education, and in cultural activities. Finally, the book connects the ethics of care with the rising interest in civil society, and with limits on what law and rights are thought able to accomplish. It shows the promise of the ethics of care for dealing with global problems and with efforts to foster international civility.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stoljar defends weakly substantive relational autonomy against the charge that it is objectionably perfectionist. She distinguishes weak substantive accounts (which require self-regarding attitudes like self-trust, not specific values) from strong substantive accounts (which constrain permissible values). Weak substantive accounts avoid perfectionism while recognizing that oppressive socialization can undermine autonomy even when procedural conditions are met.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies relational autonomy's relationship to perfectionism, defending the view that autonomy requires certain self-regarding attitudes but not specific values. For DIY ethics, this suggests that cultivating self-trust and self-worth may matter more than whether one does things oneself or accepts help. The moral question is whether actions express appropriate self-regarding attitudes, not whether they manifest independence.

  POSITION: Defends weakly substantive relational autonomy as non-perfectionistic. Distinguishes self-regarding attitude requirements from value constraints.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Holroyd examines whether constitutively relational autonomy conceptions justify paternalistic interventions. She argues that while such conceptions do permit some interventions that procedural accounts would not, they also provide resources for limiting paternalism. The key is distinguishing interventions that support autonomy development from those that impose external values.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the paternalism worry about relational autonomy. For DIY ethics, this suggests that sometimes encouraging people to accept help (rather than insisting on self-reliance) may support autonomy development without being paternalistic. But there are limits: forcing dependence would be paternalistic. The challenge is distinguishing support from control.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Baumann distinguishes causally relational accounts (relationships causally support autonomy) from constitutively relational accounts (social conditions partly constitute autonomy). He argues that causally relational accounts are less controversial but also less revisionary—they can accommodate most traditional autonomy theory. Constitutive accounts are more radical but face challenges explaining how autonomy can be both social and personal.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the key distinction within relational autonomy literature. For DIY ethics, causally relational accounts suggest relationships support capacity for self-reliance, while constitutive accounts suggest self-reliance may be conceptually confused—autonomy is inherently social. The distinction matters for whether DIY self-sufficiency is even coherently achievable vs. merely causally supported by relationships.

Because human cognition is deeply dependent on social testimony and collaboration, the ideal should be "intellectual interdependence" rather than autonomy. We ought to rely on others epistemically, not aspire to self-sufficiency in belief formation.

For DIY ethics, this suggests that epistemic self-reliance (figuring things out yourself) may be misguided—relying on others' expertise may be intellectually virtuous, not deficient.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes labor (cyclical biological necessity, consumed immediately) from work (durable object-creation) and action (political engagement). Labor corresponds to animal laborans, work to homo faber. Modern society's emphasis on labor and consumption has devalued lasting work and action, reducing humans to their metabolic functions. Work creates a stable, durable world of artifacts that mediates human relationships and provides permanence against life's cyclicality.

  RELEVANCE: Arendt's labor/work distinction addresses whether productive activity's value depends on product durability or the activity itself. If work (creating lasting objects) is more valuable than labor (repetitive maintenance), this suggests outcome-orientation. However, her emphasis on homo faber as world-building through making provides grounds for valuing the productive process, not just products. Relevant to DIY insofar as creating durable things yourself may constitute "work" in Arendt's sense, building a meaningful human world.

To contribute to the closing of this research gap this article considers a set of questions which Morgenthau himself asked at the beginning of his career as its conceptual framework. It is argued that Morgenthau was particularly concerned with the dehumanisation of socio-political life in modern democracies evoked through processes of ideologisation, technologisation, and scientification, which he countered by focusing on a re-introduction of the human factor to politics. This demonstrates that Morgenthau's work is a rich source for IR theory because his intellectual agenda was driven by concerns similar to what we find in post-structuralism},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a non-essentialist account of alienation as a disturbance in one's relation to self, others, activity, and world. Alienation occurs when subjects cannot appropriate their own lives—when their relations become opaque, unresponsive, or rigid. Moves beyond Marx's production-centered account to include alienation in consumption, social roles, and identity. Alienation is a relation of relationlessness: the subject is involved but cannot make the relation their own or experience it as meaningful.

  RELEVANCE: Jaeggi's broader conception of alienation extends beyond wage labor to any activity where the subject cannot appropriate the process or identify with what they're doing. This applies directly to delegation: if you cannot appropriate work done by others on your behalf, you experience alienation even if the outcome is desirable. Her emphasis on appropriation (making something one's own) speaks to DIY's potential value: doing it yourself may be necessary to appropriate the activity and its results.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a pluralistic account of meaningful work combining subjective and objective dimensions. Work is meaningful when it (1) is experienced as meaningful by the worker, (2) involves autonomy and skill exercise, (3) makes a genuine social contribution, and (4) is recognized by others. Defends meaningful work as central to human flourishing and a proper concern of justice. Argues liberal political philosophy must accommodate meaningful work without collapsing into perfectionism.

  RELEVANCE: Veltman's account bridges subjective experience and objective features, suggesting work's value includes both process (autonomy, skill exercise) and outcome (social contribution, recognition). This pluralism is directly relevant to DIY: doing things yourself may be valuable both for the autonomous exercise of skill (process) and the contribution made (outcome).

  abstract = {Abstract This book examines the importance of work in human well-being, addressing several related philosophical questions about work and arguing on the whole that meaningful work is central in human flourishing. Work impacts flourishing not only in developing and exercising human capabilities but also in instilling and reflecting virtues such as honor, pride, dignity, self-discipline, and self-respect. Work also attaches to a sense of purposefulness and personal identity, and meaningful work can promote both personal autonomy and a sense of personal satisfaction that issues from making oneself useful. Further still, work bears a formative influence on character and intelligence and provides a primary avenue for exercising complex skills and garnering esteem and recognition from others. The author defends a pluralistic account of meaningful work, identifying four primary dimension of meaningful work: (1) developing or exercising the worker’s capabilities, especially insofar as this expression meets with recognition and esteem; (2) supporting virtues; (3) providing a purpose, and especially producing something of enduring value; and (4) integrating elements of a worker’s life. In light of the impact that work has on flourishing, the author argues that well-ordered societies provide opportunities for meaningful work and that the philosophical view of value pluralism, which casts work as having no special significance in an individual’s life, is false. The book also addresses oppressive work that undermines human flourishing, examining potential solutions to minimize the impact of bad work on those who perform it.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that justice in work involves not just fair wages or working conditions, but the quality of work itself—whether it engages workers' capacities and allows them to contribute meaningfully. Work's meaning comes from social contribution (producing goods others value) rather than subjective satisfaction. A just society must address distribution of meaningful work opportunities, not just income. Critiques both libertarian and egalitarian views for focusing only on distributive justice while neglecting work's qualitative dimensions.

  RELEVANCE: Muirhead's emphasis on work as social contribution (serving others) versus self-realization (developing oneself) maps onto outcome-versus-process debates. If work's value primarily lies in social contribution, then delegation is less problematic—the contribution still occurs. However, if work also enables development of one's capacities, doing it yourself may be necessary to realize this value.

Russell Muirhead shows how the common hope for work that fulfills us involves more than personal interest; it also points to larger understandings of a just society. We are defined in part by the jobs we hold, and Muirhead has something important to say about the partial satisfactions of the working life, and the increasingly urgent need to balance the claims of work against those of family and community. Against the tendency to think of work exclusively in contractual terms, Muirhead focuses on the importance of work to our sense of a life well lived. Our notions of freedom and fairness are incomplete, he argues, without due consideration of how we fit the work we do. Muirhead weaves his argument out of sociological, economic, and philosophical analysis. He shows, among other things, how modern feminism's effort to reform domestic work and extend the promise of careers has contributed to more democratic understandings of what it means to have work that fits. His account of individual and social fit as twin standards of assessment is original and convincing--it points both to the unavoidable problem of distributing bad work in society and to the personal importance of finding fulfilling work. These themes are pursued through a wide-ranging discussion that engages thinkers from Plato to John Stuart Mill to Betty Friedan.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that for Marx, unalienated production is essentially social: it requires producing for others who appreciate one's work, not solitary self-realization. Unalienated work has four features: freely chosen, involves self-realization, intended to satisfy others' needs, and appropriately appreciated by those others. Contrasts Marx with expressivist readings that emphasize individual self-realization. The social dimension—mutual recognition through production—is constitutive of unalienated labor, not merely valuable as a side-effect.

  RELEVANCE: Kandiyali's emphasis on the essential sociality of unalienated work directly challenges individualist DIY ethics. If Marx is right that meaningful production requires others' recognition and serving their needs, purely personal DIY projects may fail to realize work's full value. However, this also suggests delegation to others may preserve work's value if it maintains social relations of mutual recognition. Critical for assessing whether DIY can be meaningful when it serves only oneself.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes two concepts of meaningful work: quality (work good for the worker—autonomous, engaging, skill-using) and significance (work good for others—making valuable contributions). These can come apart: assembly line work may have high significance (producing needed goods) but low quality; an engaging hobby may have high quality but low significance. Both dimensions matter, but political philosophy should prioritize ensuring significance-work opportunities (contributive justice) over quality-work.

  RELEVANCE: This distinction directly addresses the DIY question by separating process-value (quality) from outcome-value (significance). Doing things yourself may preserve quality-meaningfulness (autonomous engagement) but sacrifice significance-meaningfulness (social contribution) if the outcome serves only yourself. Van der Deijl's prioritization of significance over quality suggests delegation may be preferable when it enables greater social contribution. However, this assumes the activity is work rather than leisure.

Typical cases of meaningless work that have been used to clarify this concept are assembly line work, and work involving other types of mindless tasks, but also David Graeber's ‘bullshit jobs’. I argue that there are at least two fundamental reasons to care about meaningful work: reasons from the wellbeing of the worker and reasons pertaining to meaningfulness of the worker's life. I first argue that a concept of meaningful work needs to reflect these two values, but that these two values may come apart. Because of this, accounts that provide a single answer to the question to what extent a particular work context is meaningful work for a particular worker are unable to reflect these two values. I then survey three promising accounts of meaningful work: perfectionism, which captures the self‐interested aspect of meaningful work well but fails to capture the meaningfulness aspect appropriately; consequentialism, which captures the meaningfulness aspect well but fails to capture the self‐interested aspect; and Wolf's Fitting Fulfilment View of meaningful projects, which can be read as addressing both concerns but leads to implausible judgments about meaningful work. I then argue that we should conceive of the concerns that fall under the notion of meaningful work as two separate concepts and values. The best work incorporates both these dimensions but falling short on either dimension is problematic for different reasons.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends a liberal, non-perfectionist case for meaningful work as person-engaging social contribution connected to reciprocity. In a cooperative society, all members should have opportunities to contribute in ways that engage their capacities—this is what they owe each other as reciprocating participants. Meaningful work as person-engaging contribution is thus a social basis of self-respect, not a perfectionist good. Existing liberal defenses relying on work's formative effects are too narrow.

  RELEVANCE: Althorpe's emphasis on person-engaging contribution combines process and outcome: the activity must engage the person's capacities (process) while making a social contribution (outcome). This suggests DIY's value depends on whether it involves both engagement and contribution. Personal projects lacking social contribution may fail reciprocity's demands even if engaging. Relevant for assessing whether DIY can be justified in liberal terms without perfectionism.

The paper offers an alternative reply by arguing that meaningful work, understood as a person-engaging social contribution, is intimately connected through reciprocity to the fundamental political idea of society as a system of cooperation between free and equal participating members.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes "quiet quitting" (limiting work to contracted requirements) through Honneth's recognition theory as workers' strategic response to misrecognition. When the "entrepreneurial ethic" demands emotional over-investment in work, workers experience disrespect rather than recognition. Quiet quitters compensate by seeking recognition outside work rather than through collective workplace struggles. The entrepreneurial work ethic undermines genuine recognition by making excessive demands that most workers cannot meet.

Relevant to DIY insofar as it questions whether all productive activity must be meaningful or identity-constituting. May suggest that not all tasks need to be done oneself—limiting engagement to genuine opportunities for recognition is rational. Addresses boundary between work and other life domains.

Honneth argues that misrecognition in any one of three social spheres (the family, political society, and the workplace) constitutes disrespect and causes psychological harm. While Honneth contends that experiences of disrespect tend to motivate collective “struggles for recognition,” we suggest that quiet quitters present an alternative response to disrespect, individually seeking recognition in other social spheres rather than engaging in collective action. Further, we draw on Honneth to suggest that the contemporary “entrepreneurial” work ethic – the widespread expectation that workers invest emotionally in their work role – can in practice undermine workplace recognition, contributing to quiet quitters’ compensatory emphasis on recognitive relations outside of work. This recognition-theoretical approach extends current discussions around quiet quitting and yields valuable insights for management theory and practice regarding the critical role of genuine employee recognition in promoting individual well-being and meaningful work experiences.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a "technological contributive justice" framework arguing that automation should distribute work fairly, not just income.

Fairness requires that everyone benefit from automation in their work (accessing meaningful tasks) not just income. Proposes machines should free humans for meaningful work rather than eliminate work entirely. Contributive perspective complements but does not replace distributive concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether automation (analogous to delegation) threatens meaningful work or can be designed to enhance it. If justice requires meaningful work opportunities, then complete delegation/automation may be problematic even with income maintenance. However, selective automation enabling more meaningful work for all may be preferable to unequal access to meaningful tasks.

Nonetheless, we may benefit from this disruption, as automation may offer opportunities to make social cooperation fairer. Just as philosophers have addressed the problem of which values and principles should regulate the distribution of goods, so we may consider the problem of the values and principles guiding technological change with regard to work. Indeed, automation is often addressed from a distributive perspective. A prevailing concern in the debate is about making sure that the technologically unemployed will not lose access to income through unconditional redistributive policies, while some have suggested policies like a “robot tax” to disincentivize companies' investment in labor-saving devices. While crucial given the massive increase in profits afforded by automation and the inequalities that go with it, concerns about income are not the only ones raised by automation. Without underestimating their relevance, in this article I leave aside problems about income to focus on automation from the perspective of work. That is, my concern here is on social cooperation from the perspective of contribution instead of distribution, within a framework that may be called technological contributive justice. If UBI advocates expect everyone to benefit from automation in their income, the contributive perspective postulates that everyone should benefit from automation in their work. There are three main reasons behind this shift. First, even in a world in which income were unconditionally accessible to all, there would be the problem of how to fairly organize the unautomated socially necessary labor (e.g., waste collection, care work, etc.).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a Kantian account where work is meaningful when it (1) is freely entered into, (2) allows autonomy and independence, (3) enables development of rational capacities, (4) provides sufficient wages, (5) supports moral development, and (6) is not paternalistic. Grounded in treating workers as ends in themselves with dignity, not merely as means. Meaningful work respects and develops human rational agency.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues work is meaningful when it allows workers to exercise their capacities in complex, creative ways and see their product as embodying their thought and will. Draws on Marx's concept of objectification (not alienation): meaningful work externalizes the worker's ideas and purposes in the product. Fragmented, routinized work prevents this objectification even if outcomes are valuable. The activity itself, not just the product, must engage the worker's full capacities.

  RELEVANCE: Schwartz's emphasis on objectification—seeing one's thought embodied in the product through engaging activity—strongly supports process-value and DIY ethics. If meaning requires exercising complex capacities throughout production, delegation to others prevents achieving this meaning even if products are identical. One of the clearer defenses of work-as-process-value in the literature. Directly relevant to whether DIY has distinctive value beyond outcomes.

  POSITION: Neo-Marxian account emphasizing self-realization through complex productive activity. Strongly process-oriented. High-medium importance for process-value arguments.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Rawls's theory of justice requires ensuring opportunities for meaningful work as a social basis of self-respect. Self-respect depends partly on successfully exercising capacities in valued activities, and for most people work provides this opportunity. Justice requires not just income but access to work that engages capacities. Rawls's own limited attention to work quality is a gap in his theory that can be filled consistently with his framework.

  RELEVANCE: If meaningful work opportunities are necessary for self-respect and thus required by justice, this has implications for DIY and delegation. Delegation that maintains self-respect-supporting work opportunities is permissible; delegation that eliminates such opportunities threatens justice. Relevant for assessing whether personal productive activities (DIY) contribute to self-respect when employment is alienating or unavailable. Connects individual concerns about work's meaning to justice requirements.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Questions whether justice requires ensuring meaningful work beyond ensuring fair distribution of welfare or opportunity. Markets may efficiently allocate labor even if resulting work is not meaningful for all. Paternalistic or perfectionist intervention to ensure meaningful work is difficult to justify in liberal terms. Meaningful work may be part of the good life, but fairness requires only that people have fair access to welfare or capability to achieve their life plans.

  RELEVANCE: Arneson's skepticism about meaningful work as a justice requirement provides a counterpoint to Veltman, Moriarty, and others. If meaningful work is not required by justice, delegation choices are primarily matters of personal preference or prudence, not moral obligation. This would make DIY supererogatory (valuable but not required) rather than morally significant. Relevant for determining whether moral value of doing things yourself has political implications or is purely personal.

I am more than happy to be counted a comrade in this respect. But otherwise I disagree with much of what he says in his response: I not only continue to support the criticisms I made in Keat (2009), but also disagree with another of Arneson’s main criticisms of Arneson (1987).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends a human right to work understood not just as a right to employment but to fair conditions including meaningful work. Work connects individuals to community, enables self-development, and provides material support. A right to work includes not just income but opportunities to contribute and develop capacities. This right grounds obligations on states and employers to ensure work quality, not just availability.

  RELEVANCE: If there is a right to meaningful work, this has implications for voluntary DIY versus delegation. Exercising a right typically permits but does not require exercise—you may delegate if you choose. However, a right to meaningful work suggests everyone should have access to opportunities for engaging productive activity. Relevant for whether DIY preserves a valuable opportunity (exercising the right) or whether delegation to others is equally permissible. Addresses political versus personal dimensions.

  abstract = {The present paper argues that a right to work, defined as social and legal guarantees to fair conditions of employment, should be an essential part of a democratic state with market arrangements. This argument proceeds along the following lines. First, I reconstruct an account of rights that defends the “correlativity” thesis of rights and duties. The basic idea is that a social member’s legitimate demand to something of value, such as gainful employment, implies duties on the part of others to respect and fulfill it. These duties include the following with regard to that demand: avoiding actions that cause the harm, protecting it against standard threats, and otherwise providing aid in case it is deprived. Second, I sketch an outline of what a right to work will entail in terms of the correlative duties just described. This means that respect and fulfillment of the demand will require both social members and the democratic state alike to guarantee fair conditions of employment: first, by forbearing from actions that deprive members of access to work; and second, by protecting members against threats of deprivation and aiding them when they are so deprived. Third, I answer some ethical and empirical objections to the idea of a right to work: that it violates the legal rights of owners and employers, fails to impart self-respect, lacks economic efficiency, and erodes human capital by undermining competitive incentives. Finally, I make some concluding observations that a democratic right to work so conceived is ethically and economically superior to alternative arrangements that neither respect nor fulfill these correlative duties to avoid harm, protect against threats, and provide aid in cases of deprivation},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Marx's view that productive labor is essential to human nature and self-realization against critics who emphasize leisure or consumption. Work is not merely instrumental but constitutive of distinctively human existence: transforming nature, developing capacities, creating a human world. The problem is not work itself but alienated work under capitalism. Communism would realize work's potential for free, creative self-activity, not abolish work.

  RELEVANCE: Sayers' defense of work-as-essential-to-human-nature provides the strongest grounds for DIY-as-intrinsically-valuable: if productive activity is constitutive of human flourishing, then delegation represents a loss regardless of outcomes. However, this depends on work being unalienated (free, creative). Relevant for assessing whether all productive activity has intrinsic value or only certain kinds (unalienated, creative, autonomous). Addresses whether humans should minimize work or engage in it as valuable in itself.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Marx's conception of self-realization through work, distinguishing several components: exercising capacities, developing new capacities, and seeing oneself in one's products. Questions whether work is the best arena for self-realization compared to politics, art, or science. Notes tension between self-realization (developing oneself) and social contribution (serving others). Market constraints and division of labor make comprehensive self-realization through work unlikely even in non-capitalist systems.

  RELEVANCE: Elster's skepticism about work as the primary arena for self-realization suggests DIY may be overrated as a source of meaning—other activities (politics, relationships, leisure) may better serve self-realization. His distinction between developing capacities (process) and creating valued products (outcome) addresses the DIY question: which dimension matters more? If self-realization is available through non-work activities, delegation of routine productive tasks may be rational. Relevant for assessing work's place in the good life.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Identifies multiple goods work provides beyond income: social contribution, excellence in activity, community and recognition, self-realization, and social status. Different jobs provide these goods in varying degrees, raising justice issues about their distribution. Markets allocate income relatively efficiently but distribute other work-goods inequitably. Justice requires attention to how non-monetary work-goods are distributed, not just wages.

  RELEVANCE: Gheaus and Herzog's taxonomy of work-goods helps assess what delegation forfeits. Delegation may preserve social contribution (outcome) but sacrifice excellence in activity (process) and self-realization. Whether this matters depends on availability of these goods elsewhere and their relative importance. Relevant for distinguishing what DIY provides (exercise of excellence, self-realization) from what delegation preserves (contribution, possibly status).

We use the term 'the goods of work' to refer to those benefits of work that cannot be obtained in exchange for money and that can be enjoyed mostly or exclusively in the context of work. Drawing on empirical research and various philosophical traditions of thinking about work we identify four goods of work: 1) attaining various types of excellence; 2) making a social contribution; 3) experiencing community; and 4) gaining social recognition. Our account of the goods of work can be read as unpacking the ways in which work can be meaningful. The distribution of the goods of work is a concern of justice for two conjoint reasons: First, they are part of the conception of the good of a large number of individuals. Second, in societies without an unconditional income and in which most people are not independently wealthy, paid work is non-optional and workers have few, if any, occasions to realize these goods outside their job. Taking into account the plurality of the goods of work and their importance for justice challenges the theoretical and political status quo, which focuses mostly on justice with regard to the distribution of income. We defend this account against the libertarian challenge that a free labour market gives individuals sufficient options to realise the goods of work important to them, and discuss the challenge from state neutrality. In the conclusion, we hint towards possible implications for today's labour markets.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a normative (objective) account of meaningful work beyond subjective experience and social agreement. Work is meaningful when it is meaningful-to-oneself, meaningful-to-others, and meaningful-independent-of-both (objectively valuable). All three dimensions matter. Purely subjective accounts cannot criticize workers who find meaning in objectively harmful work; purely objective accounts ignore workers' lived experience. Meaningful work requires alignment of subjective, intersubjective, and objective dimensions.

  RELEVANCE: Michaelson's three-dimensional account suggests DIY's value depends on multiple factors: subjective experience of meaning, others' recognition, and objective value of the activity/product. Delegation might preserve objective and intersubjective meaning (social contribution, others' recognition) while sacrificing subjective meaning. Or DIY might have subjective meaning without objective or intersubjective meaning (hobbies serving no one). Relevant for assessing when DIY versus delegation is preferable across these dimensions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Scientific communities achieve epistemic progress more effectively when scientists divide labor by pursuing different research approaches, even when some approaches appear initially less promising.

Rather, as Roberts and Wood (Intellectual virtues: an essay in regulative epistemology, OUP Oxford, Oxford, pp. 259–260, 2007) note, intellectually virtuous autonomy involves reliance and outsourcing (e.g., on other individuals, technology, medicine, etc.) to an appropriate extent, while at the same time maintaining intellectual self-direction. In this essay, I want to investigate the ramifications for intellectual autonomy of a particular kind of epistemic dependence: cognitive enhancement. Cognitive enhancements (as opposed to therapeutic cognitive improvements) involve the use of technology and medicine to improve cognitive capacities in healthy individuals, through mechanisms ranging from smart drugs to brain-computer interfaces. With reference to case studies in bioethics, as well as the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, it is shown that epistemic dependence, in this extreme form, poses a prima facie threat to the retention of intellectual autonomy, specifically, by threatening to undermine our intellectual self-direction. My aim will be to show why certain kinds of cognitive enhancements are subject to this objection from self-direction, while others are not. Once this is established, we’ll see that even some extreme kinds of cognitive enhancement might be not merely compatible with, but constitutive of, virtuous intellectual autonomy.},

Six primary and two supplemental studies (N = 3,262) extend previous research by exploring how illusions of knowledge result from reliance on other agents. After teaming with knowledgeable partners (artificially intelligent agents or human teammates) on a trivia quiz, people overestimated how well they would perform on future quizzes for which help was not available; this bias was not evident for participants who never received help. Moreover, overconfidence was insensitive to whether assistance was provided on hard versus easy problems, or even whether the assistance was accurate. Receiving outside assistance creates an ambiguity regarding who deserves credit for success or blame for failure. When this ambiguity is removed, people become better calibrated.

After reading popularized articles addressed to a lay audience, laypeople agreed more with the knowledge claims they contained and were more confident in their claim judgments than after reading articles addressed to expert audiences.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cognitive outsourcing to others (or technology) is epistemically unproblematic when done appropriately. The question is not whether to outsource but how much and to whom. Appropriate outsourcing requires calibrated trust and maintaining sufficient understanding to evaluate when delegation is warranted.

  RELEVANCE: Provides moderate framework for evaluating cognitive outsourcing and delegation. Neither valorizes self-reliance nor advocates unrestricted delegation. Useful for identifying when reliance on others is epistemically appropriate versus when it represents problematic abdication.

  POSITION: Moderate position that cognitive outsourcing is legitimate when appropriately calibrated. Rejects both self-reliance dogmatism and uncritical delegation.

  abstract = {Abstract To what extent can we rely on others for information without such reliance becoming epistemically problematic? In this paper, this question is addressed in terms of a specific form of reliance: cognitive outsourcing . Cognitive outsourcing involves handing over ( outsourcing ) one's information collection and processing ( the cognitive ) to others. The specific question that will be asked about such outsourcing is if there is an epistemic problem about cognitive outsourcing as such . To ask if there is an epistemic problem with x for S is to ask if x is a problem for S ’s ability to acquire true belief and avoid false belief. To ask if there is a problem for S with x as such is to ask if it is impossible to solve the problem for S while leaving x as is. I argue that, if we consider the five most plausible candidate epistemic problems raised by cognitive outsourcing—i.e., unreliability, gullibility, irrationality, dependency, and lack of epistemic autonomy—we see for each candidate that it is either not an epistemic problem, or not a problem about cognitive outsourcing as such.},

This dependence is not restricted to what we are told in face-to-face encounters, for we also take ourselves to know all sorts of things that only reached us through a long chain of utterances and documents, whose evidential status we have never investigated for ourselves and will never be in a position to investigate. And the content of such knowledge is not confined to the arcana of specialized studies but includes such mundane matters as the facts of one’s own birth and parentage, the geographical and institutional facts of one’s immediate environment, and the general facts that make up one’s basic sense of what the world is like. In part it is the enormity of this dependence that makes for the interest in the subject of testimony, combined with the apparent clash between the kind of epistemic relations involved here and the classic empiricist picture of genuine knowledge basing itself either on direct experience of the facts or on working out conclusions for oneself. It isn’t just that the bulk of what we take ourselves to know is so highly mediated, as even knowledge gained through a microscope or other scientific instrument must be; rather it is that the vehicle of mediation here—what other people say—seems so flimsy, unregulated, and is known in plenty of cases to be unreliable, even deliberately so.

  abstract = {Household labor is commonly defined as a set of physical tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and shopping. Sociologists sometimes reference non-physical activities related to “household management,” but these are typically mentioned in passing, imprecisely defined, or treated as equivalent to physical tasks. Using 70 in-depth interviews with members of 35 couples, this study argues that such tasks are better understood as examples of a unique dimension of housework: cognitive labor. The data demonstrate that cognitive labor entails anticipating needs, identifying options for filling them, making decisions, and monitoring progress. Because such work is taxing but often invisible to both cognitive laborers and their partners, it is a frequent source of conflict for couples. Cognitive labor is also a gendered phenomenon: women in this study do more cognitive labor overall and more of the anticipation and monitoring work in particular. However, male and female participation in decision-making, arguably the cognitive labor component most closely linked to power and influence, is roughly equal. These findings identify and define an overlooked—yet potentially consequential—source of gender inequality at the household level and suggest a new direction for research on the division of household labor.},

  abstract = {This article describes how issue specialization through deliberative institutions called “issue publics” can improve the quality of democratic decision making. Issue specialization improves decisions by instantiating a cognitive division of labor among the mass public, which creates efficiencies in decision making and grants large groups of average citizens a scalable advantage over small groups of even the smartest and most capable individuals. Issue specialization further improves decisions by capturing issue-specific information, concentrating it within the specialized deliberative enclaves of issue publics, and refining citizens’ issue preferences. These advantages are brought to bear in wider democratic politics and policy through information shortcuts and through the specialized electoral incentives of representatives. The article responds to concerns about political ignorance, polarization/partisanship, rent seeking, and socioeconomic bias and argues that issue specialization can provide a valuable brake to polarization yet needs institutional supplementation to engage marginalized citizens and combat bias. In Democracy for Realists, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels (2016) marshal a vast body of empirical evidence to show that democracy lacks the kind of informed citizens needed for it to govern rationally. Though this view is familiar to scholars of American politics and public opinion, political theorists have only recently begun to consider what this evidence means for democratic theory, with some agreeing with Achen and Bartels that the evidence is devastating (Brennan 2016; Somin 2013). These critiques are strengthened by the recent development of epistemic democracy, one of the most active areas of research in democratic theory (Schwartzberg 2015). At its heart is an instrumental theory of legitimacy by which a system of government is said to be legitimate on the basis of the quality of its decisions or outcomes (Estlund 2008; Landemore 2013). David Estlund, for instance, argues that democracy must derive at least some legitimacy from the quality of its decisions, opening the door for bad decisions to undermine democratic legitimacy.

This challenge is broadly familiar in the history of political thought, yet two mutually reinforcing features mark out this newest iteration as especially worrisome. First, theorists’ endorsement of instrumentalism makes it seem that even democracy’s champions might abandon it in the face of the right evidence. Second, invoking social scientific evidence lends the challenge a veneer of scientific validity, supplying for some precisely the evidence needed to confirm epistemic doubts and, in contrast to earlier iterations, making it seem like more than just elitist prejudice.

Given the scale and complexity of modern polities, however, even the most attentive citizens cannot engage knowledgeably with most of the collective decisions that affect them. For this reason, democratic theorists increasingly conceptualize democratic systems as requiring divisions of cognitive labor, in which citizens trust others to make decisions on their behalf. Modern democracies have long relied on such trustees, yet institutional supports for good trust decisions by citizens are often weak or missing. We argue that deliberative minipublics can serve as trusted information proxies that help citizens make the most of their scarce cognitive resources.

I defend the outsourceability of know-how, and I refute the objections that reduce outsourced know-how to the knowledge of how to ask for help, of how to get things done, or of external contents. Interestingly, outsourcing differs from social cooperation, collective agency, testimonial transmission, and many other notions in social-epistemological debates. Thus, outsourcing provides not only a hitherto unconsidered form of know-how but also a novel way for knowledge to be social. Furthermore, outsourcing plausibly involves a ‘social’ cognitive extension that does not rest on EMT or HEC. Given the outsourceability of know-how, we must reconsider the nature of know-how and expertise, as well as the relation between non-experts and experts.},

Thus, there is no person in a position to assess the success of such a practical argument for themselves. This arrangement virtually guarantees that mistakes will accrue whenever we engage in cross-field practical reasoning. Furthermore, Millgram argues, hyper-specialization makes intellectual autonomy extremely difficult. Our only hope is to provide better translations between the fields, in order to achieve intellectual transparency.

          I argue against Millgram’s pessimistic conclusion about intellectual autonomy, and against his suggested solution of translation. Instead, I take his analysis to reveal that there are actually several very distinct forms intellectual autonomy that are significantly in tension. One familiar kind is direct autonomy, where we seek to understand arguments and reasons for ourselves. Another kind is delegational autonomy, where we seek to find others to invest with our intellectual trust when we cannot understand. A third is management autonomy, where we seek to encapsulate fields, in order to manage their overall structure and connectivity. Intellectual transparency will help us achieve direct autonomy, but many intellectual circumstances require that we exercise delegational and management autonomy. However, these latter forms of autonomy require us to give up on transparency},
