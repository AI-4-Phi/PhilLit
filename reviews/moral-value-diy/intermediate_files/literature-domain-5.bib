====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain explores whether virtues require direct action and skill acquisition
through practice. The central debate concerns the "skill model" of virtue, which
draws an analogy between moral virtues and practical skills like playing piano or
carpentry. Proponents (notably Julia Annas) argue that virtues develop through
repeated practice and deliberate cultivation, just as skills do. This view has
significant implications for understanding how self-reliance and doing things
yourself might be constitutive of virtue rather than merely instrumentally valuable.

However, the skill model faces substantial challenges. Critics argue that (1)
skills can be assessed by agent-independent standards while virtues arguably cannot
(Schuster 2023), (2) expert skills are "brittle" and domain-specific rather than
flexibly robust across contexts (Kilov 2023), and (3) the analogy fails to capture
the distinctively moral and affective dimensions of virtue. Recent work integrates
virtue acquisition with self-regulation theory (Krettenauer & Stichter 2023) and
explores how habituation shapes both conscious and non-conscious processes in
character development.

A related strand concerns practical wisdom (phronesis) as the master virtue that
guides when and how to act virtuously. Practical wisdom requires both intellectual
understanding and experiential knowledge gained through doing. Contemporary virtue
ethics emphasizes that phronesis cannot be fully taught but must be cultivated
through guided practice - suggesting a strong connection between virtuous character
and direct personal engagement with morally significant activities.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
If virtues are indeed skill-like and develop primarily through practice, then doing
things yourself would be constitutive of character excellence rather than merely
instrumentally valuable. The habituative model suggests that delegating important
activities might prevent the formation of virtuous dispositions. However, critics
of the skill model raise important questions about whether this analogy captures
what's distinctive about moral virtue.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very few papers directly address whether delegation or technological substitution
might impair virtue development. The literature focuses on skill acquisition
generally but rarely examines when self-performance vs delegation matters morally.
More work needed on how practical wisdom relates to decisions about when to do
things yourself vs rely on others or technology.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The debate over the skill model is crucial for the project. If the skill model is
correct, there are strong grounds for thinking DIY activity has constitutive moral
value. If critics are right that skills and virtues differ fundamentally, the case
for DIY weakens. Pay special attention to what makes practice essential for virtue
- is it the external performance or the internal cultivation of practical wisdom?

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Virtue-as-skill proponents (6 papers): Virtues develop like skills through
  practice and require active cultivation
- Skill model critics (3 papers): Virtues and skills differ in fundamental ways
  that undermine the analogy
- Phronesis-centered approaches (5 papers): Practical wisdom as master virtue
  requires experiential knowledge
- Habituation theorists (4 papers): Character develops through repeated action
  shaping both conscious and unconscious processes

  CORE ARGUMENT: The skill model of virtue faces a dilemma: ordinary skills provide
  a plausible model of practical reason only insofar as they are assessed by
  agent-independent standards. Therefore, if the skill model serves its purpose of
  explaining good practical reason in virtue ethics, virtue must likewise be
  assessed primarily by agent-independent moral standards - undermining agent-centered
  virtue ethics that rejects such standards.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges whether the virtue-as-skill analogy supports the
  idea that virtues require doing things yourself. If Schuster is right that skills
  and virtues differ fundamentally regarding standards of assessment, this weakens
  claims that DIY activity is constitutive of virtue in the way skill practice is
  constitutive of skill acquisition.

  POSITION: Skeptical of virtue-as-skill model; argues it ultimately requires
  agent-independent standards inconsistent with agent-centered virtue ethics.

  abstract = {According to agent-centered virtue ethics, acting well is not a matter of conforming to agent-independent moral standards, like acting so as to respect humanity or maximize utility. Instead, virtuous agents determine what is called for in their circumstances through good practical reason. This is an attractive view, but it requires a plausible account of how good practical reason works. To that end, some theorists invoke the skill model of virtue, according to which virtue involves essentially the same kind of practical reason as ordinary skills. I contend, however, that ordinary skills provide a plausible and informative model of good practical reason only insofar as they are assessed by agent-independent standards. And so virtue, likewise, must be assessed primarily by agent-independent moral standards, if the skill model is to serve its purpose. I consider how agent-centered virtue ethics might avert this dilemma. But I ultimately suggest proceeding a different way.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Expert skills are "brittle" - they develop in narrow ways and can
  falter in novel situations, with experts sometimes performing worse than novices
  outside their domain. This brittleness contradicts the virtue ethics claim that
  virtues enable good action across contexts. Virtue theorists must either abandon
  the skill analogy or accept that virtues are similarly brittle and context-bound.

  RELEVANCE: Raises important questions about whether practicing skills yourself
  genuinely develops transferable virtuous character or merely narrow competencies.
  If skills are brittle, then DIY skill acquisition may not build robust moral
  character as virtue ethicists claim.

  POSITION: Challenges virtue-as-skill model based on empirical findings about
  expert skill brittleness; situationist implications for virtue theory.

  keywords = {virtue-as-skill, situationism, expertise, High},
  abstract = {Buoyed by research in philosophy and moral psychology, virtue ethics has become increasingly influential in the literature. This renewed attention has also led to the development of the situationist challenge : empirical studies undermine the idea that we possess character traits that allow us to act virtuously across contexts. A promising reply to the situationist challenge is that we should not conceive of virtues as traits. Instead, we should conceive of them as expert skills. Here, I raise a new challenge for those who go in for the (s)kill against situationism. Expert skills are brittle , rather than flexible or robust. They typically develop in narrow ways and can falter in novel situations. Experts also sometimes perform worse than novices in novel situations. Such findings present a problem for the virtue-as-skill thesis. Someone who will help others only in narrow contexts or who causes more harm than good does not exemplify virtue. The brittleness of expert skills means that virtue theorists must either (a) abandon the idea that virtues explain behaviour across contexts or (b) abandon the idea that virtues are expert skills. It’s brittle virtue or bust – you can’t teach an old dogma new skills.},

  pages = {396--409},
  doi = {10.1177/10892680231170393},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Virtue acquisition can be conceptualized as self-regulatory skill
  development requiring deliberate practice and internal motivation. The moral
  identity goal (wanting to be a moral person) must be sufficiently abstract,
  internally motivated, and promotion-oriented to provide sustained motivation for
  the practice needed to develop virtue.

  RELEVANCE: Integrates virtue-as-skill model with developmental psychology and
  self-regulation theory. Suggests that doing things yourself matters for virtue
  development because practice requires self-motivated engagement - you cannot
  outsource the internal motivational work needed for character formation.

  POSITION: Supportive of skill model but emphasizes motivational prerequisites;
  developmental trajectory from concrete to abstract moral identity.
  },
  keywords = {virtue-acquisition, skill-development, moral-identity, High},
  abstract = {The acquisition of virtue can be conceptualized as a self-regulatory process in which deliberate practice results in increasingly higher levels of skillfulness in leading a virtuous life. This conceptualization resonates with philosophical virtue theories as much as it converges with psychological models about skill development, expertise, goal motivation, and self-regulation. Yet, the conceptualization of virtue as skill acquisition poses the crucial question of motivation: What motivates individuals to self-improve over time so that they can learn from past experience, correct mistakes, and expand their ethical knowledge to new and unfamiliar circumstances? In this paper, it is argued that the motivation to increase one’s level of skillfulness in leading a virtuous life is supported by a specific identity goal, namely the goal to be a moral person. However, this moral identity goal needs to carry specific goal characteristics in order to effectively provide this motivation. It needs to be sufficiently abstract, internally motivated and promotion- rather than prevention-oriented. Research in developmental psychology suggests that the moral identity of children is rather concrete, externally motivated, and prevention-oriented. With development, higher levels of abstraction, internal motivation, and promotion-orientation gain importance providing an important motivational basis for a self-regulated process of virtue acquisition.},

  volume = {78},
  number = {2},
  pages = {61--75},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Virtue ethics is not simply about being rather than doing, but
  about becoming virtuous through doing - through practicing virtuous actions that
  gradually form character. The virtuous person acts from a unified stable character
  developed through extended practice, analogous to how expert musicians develop
  through practicing their craft.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for the virtue-as-skill model. If Annas is right that
  virtues require practice like skills, then doing things yourself is not merely
  instrumentally valuable but constitutive of developing excellent character. You
  cannot become virtuous by having others do virtuous actions for you, any more than
  you can become a skilled pianist by having someone else practice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Virtues are forms of intelligent practical skill requiring both
  understanding of aims and ability to achieve them flexibly across contexts. Like
  skills, virtues develop through practice guided by understanding, involve feedback
  and correction, and eventually become integrated aspects of the agent's practical
  reasoning. The skill analogy illuminates how virtues involve both knowledge and
  practical ability.

  RELEVANCE: Most systematic development of the virtue-as-skill analogy. Argues that
  practical engagement and learning-by-doing are essential to virtue development,
  supporting the view that self-performance matters constitutively. However, also
  acknowledges that virtue requires reflective understanding, not mere behavioral
  repetition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The skill model of virtue illuminates how virtues guide right action

  skills, virtues involve perception, automaticity, and situation-specific judgment
  developed through extensive practice. This model better explains virtuous agency
  than rule-based approaches.

  function in practice. Suggests that the integrated know-how gained through
  practicing virtuous actions yourself cannot be replaced by theoretical knowledge

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aristotle's account of habituation applies not only to children but
  throughout life. Adult virtue requires ongoing wisdom-guided habituation where
  agents continue and confirm their virtuous habits through reflective practice.
  Practical wisdom itself continues to develop through habitual virtuous activity.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether character development requires continued personal
  practice even after initial virtue formation. If habituation is lifelong, then
  doing things yourself may remain important for maintaining and deepening virtue
  even in mature agents - you cannot rest on past practice but must continue active
  engagement.

  POSITION: Defends ongoing role of habituation beyond childhood; virtue maintenance
  requires continued practice guided by practical wisdom.

  keywords = {habituation, practical-wisdom, virtue-development, High},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Full virtue and practical wisdom comprise the end of neo-Aristotelian moral development, but wisdom cannot be cultivated straight away through arguments and teaching. Wisdom is integrated with, and builds upon, habituation: the acquisition of virtuous character traits through the repeated practice of corresponding virtuous actions. Habit formation equips people with a taste for, and commitment to, the good life; furthermore it provides one with discriminatory and reflective capacities to know how to act in particular circumstances. Unfortunately, habituation is often understood primarily as a method suitable only for children. This article examines whether Aristotle limited habituation to children and, if not, what the relationship between habituation and wisdom beyond childhood might look like. This article concludes that wisdom-guided habituation is also possible for adults who continue and confirm their already established virtuous habits. The implications of this for professional moral education are subsequently discussed.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Phronesis (practical wisdom) offers a multicomponent solution to
  bridging the gap between moral knowledge and moral action. Unlike single-component
  approaches (moral identity, moral emotions), phronesis integrates multiple cognitive
  and affective capacities developed through experience. Operationalizing phronesis
  for empirical measurement is feasible and could advance moral psychology.

  RELEVANCE: Practical wisdom as meta-virtue requires experiential knowledge that
  arguably can only be gained through direct engagement with morally significant
  situations. Suggests that doing things yourself may be necessary for developing
  the integrated practical judgment that constitutes phronesis - you cannot learn
  practical wisdom secondhand.

  POSITION: Neo-Aristotelian multicomponent account of practical wisdom; emphasizes
  developmental trajectory and integration of knowing, feeling, and willing.
  },
  keywords = {phronesis, practical-wisdom, moral-psychology, Medium},
  abstract = {This article has two aims. First, to offer a critical review of the literatures on two well-known single-component solutions to the problem of a gap between moral knowledge and moral action: moral identity and moral emotions. Second, to take seriously the rising interest in Aristotle-inspired virtue ethics and character development within the social sciences: approaches that seem to assume that the development of phronesis (practical wisdom) bridges the gap in question. Since phronesis is a multicomponent construct, the latter part of this article offers an overview of what those different components would be, as a necessary precursor to operationalising them if the phronesis hypothesis were to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. The idea of a neo-Aristotelian multicomponent solution to the “gappiness problem” invites comparisons with another multicomponent candidate, the neo-Kohlbergian four-component model, with which it shares at least surface similarities. Some space is thus devoted to the proposed theoretical uniqueness of a phronesis-based multicomponent model vis-à-vis the neo-Kohlbergian one. Our main conclusion is that – weaknesses in its developmental psychological grounding notwithstanding – operationalising the phronesis model for the purposes of instrument design and empirical inquiry would be a feasible and potentially productive enterprise.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Teacher expertise requires practical wisdom (phronesis) involving

  RELEVANCE: Examines how phronesis operates in professional practice, illustrating
  how practical wisdom requires direct experiential engagement that cannot be
  codified in rules or delegated. Teaching as exemplar case suggests that many
  important human activities require personal cultivation of practical wisdom through

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Recent reflection on the professional knowledge of teachers has been marked by a shift away from more reductive competence and skill-focused models of teaching towards a view of teacher expertise as involving complex context-sensitive deliberation and judgement. Much of this shift has been inspired by an Aristotelian conception of practical wisdom (phronesis) also linked by Aristotle to the development of virtue and character. This has in turn led recent educational philosophers and theorists – inspired by latter-day developments in virtue ethics and virtue epistemology – to investigate the contribution of various forms of virtue to the effective practice of teaching. In this light, the present paper undertakes further exploration of the logical geography of virtue, character and practical deliberation in teaching.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Phronesis can and should be taught in moral education, but teaching

  situations. Theory alone is insufficient.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses how practical wisdom develops and whether it can be taught

  must actively engage with moral situations themselves to develop phronesis - it
  cannot be transferred passively or performed by others on your behalf.

The aim of this article is to repair the dearth of attention given to phronesis in moral education circles and to bring considerations from other, but related, discourses (such as general Aristotelian scholarship and wisdom studies in psychology) to bear on it. I pay special attention to the so-called skill analogy, which considers virtue acquisition on par with the acquisition of ordinary practical skills, but argue that current articulations of it fail to account fully for the integrative, as distinct from the constitutive, function of phronesis. I argue that the skill analogy needs to be extended to account for the fact that in order to develop fully, phronesis requires direct teaching about the nature of the well-rounded life, providing the learner with an indirect blueprint for eudaimonia. Such a blueprint cannot eschew consequentialist considerations, and to be taught well within current school systems, it needs a discrete place in the school timetable.},

But there are many character traits that cannot be understood properly in this way. Such traits are well described by attitude psychology. Moreover, the findings of attitude psychology support virtue ethics in three ways. First, they confirm the role of habituation in the development of character. Further, they show virtue ethics to be compatible with the situation manipulation experiments at the heart of the recent debate. Finally, they show how the cognitive‐affective theory of personality and the two‐system theory of behavioural cognition are compatible, thereby undermining the current empirical challenge to virtue ethics. Empirical research into the nature and development of attitudes should therefore be central to philosophical discussions of virtue and character.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Aristotle's biological treatises reveal that natural character
  traits (physiological dispositions) provide the foundation for moral virtue

It provides a new, comprehensive account of the physiological underpinnings of moral development and thereby shows, first, that Aristotle’s ethical theories do not exhaust his views about character, as has traditionally been assumed, and, second, that his treatment of natural character in the biological treatises provides the conceptual and ideological foundation for his views about habituation as developed in his ethics. This manuscript thus takes seriously Aristotle’s claim—often ignored—that nature is one of the factors through which men become “good and capable of fine deeds.” Part I (“The Physiology and Science of Natural Character”) analyzes, in three chapters, Aristotle’s notion of natural character as it is developed in the biological treatises and its role in moral development, especially as it affects women and certain “barbarians”—groups who are typically left out of accounts of Aristotle’s ethics. I also discuss its relevance for our understanding of physiognomical ideas in Aristotle. Part II (“The Physiology of Moral Development”) explores the psychophysical changes in body and soul that one is required to undergo in the process of acquiring moral virtues. It includes a discussion of Aristotle’s eugenic views, his identification of habituation as a form of human perfection, and his claims about the moral deficiencies of women that link them to his beliefs about their biological imperfections.},

They adduce empirical psychological studies to highlight the conflicted nature of conscious and nonconscious processes, arguing that because of this, cognition is too fragmented to support the kind of integrated personality needed to sustain robust virtues. This chapter explores the coordination of these two types of processing in the habits that contribute to virtuous character, thereby countering, at least in part, the situationist view of the fragmented nature of cognition. It also investigates three different paradigms of character formation: the "habits of the folk," Julia Annas' account, and Confucian character formation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Learning from failure is essential to virtue acquisition understood

  CORE ARGUMENT: The skill model of virtue requires a non-dualistic conception of
  mind to properly understand emotion's role in virtue acquisition. Skillful emotions
  are both automatic and embedded in intelligent practice. Emotions contribute
  autonomously and actively to the skillfulness of habits in virtue development,
  not merely as feelings to be controlled.

  RELEVANCE: Refines the skill model by clarifying how emotions are shaped through
  practice into skillful components of virtue. Suggests emotional cultivation through
  experience is part of what makes direct practice essential for virtue - you develop
  appropriate emotional responses by engaging with situations yourself, not just by
  learning about them.

  POSITION: Improves skill model by integrating emotion as active contributor to
  skillful virtue; challenges mind-body dualism in accounts of habituation.

  abstract = {In this chapter, the authors offer a sketch of the state of the art as concerns existing accounts of virtue acquisition in relation to automaticity. In particular, the chapter focuses on the so-called “skill model,” which the authors aim to improve by questioning its rather common underlying dualistic picture of the mind. Then, the authors propose an account of skillful emotions by identifying the features that make them both automatic and embedded in an intelligent practice. Finally, the authors show how this view can help the skill model by offering a better description of emotion shaping in virtue acquisition. By doing so, they contend that emotions contribute autonomously and actively to the skillfulness of the habits in which they are embedded.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aristotle's account of habituation involves guided practice where
  learners perform virtuous actions under the direction of teachers who already
  possess practical wisdom. Habituation is not mere behavioral conditioning but
  involves gradually developing the practical reasoning and perceptual capacities
  needed for independent virtuous action. Practice must be guided but self-performed.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies what kind of practice matters for virtue development in
  Aristotle. While guidance from wise teachers is important, learners must perform
  virtuous actions themselves to develop the integrated practical knowledge
  constituting virtue. You cannot become virtuous by passively observing or having
  others act for you.

  POSITION: Aristotelian virtue ethics; habituation as guided self-practice leading
  to practical wisdom.

  abstract = {In Metaphysics Θ.6, 1048b14-17, Aristotle treats the problem of what it is for the infinite to exist potentially, i.e. to be potentially actual. According to my interpretation, Aristotle argues that to exist potentially is for the infinite to have a potentiality which cannot be actualized in reality but only in thought, because it is a potentiality the process of whose actualization cannot be brought to an end.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Emerging technologies reshape the practices through which we
  cultivate virtues, creating both risks and opportunities for character development.
  Technomoral virtues adapted to 21st century technological conditions must be
  deliberately cultivated. Technology can impair virtue development by reducing
  opportunities for practice or can support it through wise design.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how technology affects virtue cultivation, relevant
  for understanding whether technological substitutes for doing things yourself might
  impair character development. Suggests virtue acquisition requires appropriate
  practices - if technologies eliminate those practices, character formation may
  suffer. One of few works explicitly connecting technology and virtue ethics.

  POSITION: Virtue ethics for technological age; technomoral virtues must be adapted
  to but still require cultivation through practice in technology-mediated
  environments.

  abstract = {Abstract This book explores the implications of emerging technologies for the future of the human family, in particular our growing and urgent need for the global cultivation of technomoral virtue—specific qualities of character that humans need in order to live wisely and well with the uncertainty and complexity of a rapidly changing technosocial environment. Part I identifies global challenges for the human family presented by emerging technologies and the rapid cultural and institutional shifts they trigger, presenting the philosophical tradition of virtue ethics as the most promising practical resource for learning how to cope with, and even flourish in, our increasingly uncertain and risky technosocial condition. Part II finds guidance for this ambition in the classical virtue traditions of Aristotle, Confucianism, and Buddhism, which offer practical frameworks for the cultivation of virtue that resonate even across cultural and historical boundaries. Part II also explores the basic structure of this human practice and how it might be adapted for contemporary technosocial life, and concludes with an account of twelve technomoral virtues, the global cultivation of which represents humanity’s best and perhaps only chance of having a future worth wanting. Part III applies this account of technomoral virtue to four emerging technologies that are radically reshaping the human condition: new social media, digital surveillance, robotics, and biomedical enhancement. The risks and opportunities for human flourishing created by these technologies can only be managed by the wider cultivation of those virtues, which together constitute technomoral wisdom.},
