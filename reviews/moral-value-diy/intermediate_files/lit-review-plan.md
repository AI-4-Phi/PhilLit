# Literature Review Plan: The Moral Value of Doing Things Yourself

## Research Idea Summary

This project examines the philosophical debate around whether and why doing things yourself (rather than delegating to others or using tools/technology) has moral value. The research explores competing positions on personal agency, autonomy, authenticity, and moral responsibility, while distinguishing between valuable self-sufficiency and problematic isolation or inefficiency.

## Key Research Questions

1. Is there intrinsic value in personal agency and self-reliance, independent of outcomes?
2. What are the competing philosophical positions on autonomy, authenticity, and moral responsibility as they relate to doing things yourself?
3. How do philosophers distinguish between valuable self-sufficiency and problematic isolation or inefficiency?
4. What role does technology and delegation play in preserving or undermining moral agency?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Autonomy and Self-Determination

**Focus**: Philosophical theories of autonomy, self-governance, and personal agency

**Key Questions**:
- What constitutes autonomous action versus heteronomous action?
- Do delegation and tool-use compromise autonomy?
- What is the relationship between procedural autonomy and substantive autonomy?

- Key terms: ["autonomy", "self-determination", "self-governance", "personal agency", "Frankfurt autonomy"]
- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers covering Frankfurt, Dworkin, Christman, Oshana

**Relevance to Project**: Foundational for understanding whether doing things yourself is constitutive of autonomous agency or merely instrumental.

### Domain 2: Authenticity and Self-Authorship

**Focus**: Theories of authentic living and self-authorship as moral values

**Key Questions**:
- What is the relationship between authenticity and doing things yourself?
- Does reliance on others or tools undermine authentic self-expression?

---

## Coverage Rationale

These eight domains provide comprehensive coverage by:
1. **Foundational concepts** (Domains 1-3): Core philosophical frameworks for agency, authenticity, and responsibility
2. **Contemporary applications** (Domain 4): Modern technological context that makes this question urgent
3. **Normative frameworks** (Domains 5-7): Different ethical traditions (virtue, care, labor) that ground value claims
4. **Critical balance** (Domains 6, 8): Counterarguments and limits to DIY valorization

Together they address all major philosophical traditions relevant to the DIY question while maintaining critical balance between individualistic and relational perspectives.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary thoughts on potential research contributions:
- Explicit synthesis of autonomy, authenticity, and responsibility theories applied to DIY contexts
- Systematic framework distinguishing morally valuable DIY from problematic self-reliance
- Integration of technology ethics with traditional moral philosophy on agency
- Normative guidance for when delegation preserves versus compromises moral value

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 8
- **Estimated papers**: 95-135 total
- **Key positions**:
  - Autonomy-based defenses of DIY (Kantian, self-determination theory)
  - Authenticity-based defenses (existentialist, expressivist)
  - Virtue ethics defenses (character development, practical wisdom)
  - Relational autonomy critiques (feminist, communitarian)
  - Consequentialist critiques (efficiency, expertise)
  - Middle positions (context-dependent value)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Classic texts on autonomy (Frankfurt, Dworkin), authenticity (Heidegger, Taylor), virtue ethics (Aristotle, Annas)
2. **Recent developments**: Last 5 years on AI/technology ethics, cognitive offloading, extended mind debates
3. **Critical responses**: Feminist autonomy critiques, care ethics, communitarian challenges to individualism
4. **Interdisciplinary connections**: Work on meaningful work, craftsmanship, labor philosophy

## Notes for Researchers

- **Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**: All domain searches should use structured API searches via `search_sep.py`, `search_philpapers.py`, `s2_search.py`, `search_openalex.py`
- **Prioritize SEP for foundational context**: Start each domain with relevant SEP articles to establish conceptual frameworks
- **Include recent papers**: Use `--recent` flag with `s2_search.py` and `search_openalex.py` for Domains 4, 6, 8 to capture contemporary debates
- **Balance perspectives**: Ensure equal representation of individualistic and relational/communitarian perspectives
- **Critical stance**: Actively search for objections, limitations, and counterarguments to DIY valorization
- **Interdisciplinary sources**: Include work from philosophy of technology, social epistemology, and political philosophy beyond mainstream ethics
- **Verify citations**: Use `resolve_abstract.py` and `verify_citation.py` for all papers before including in BibTeX
- **Rich annotations**: BibTeX entries must include abstracts and detailed annotations explaining relevance to research questions
