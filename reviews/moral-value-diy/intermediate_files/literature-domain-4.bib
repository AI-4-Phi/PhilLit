====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines philosophical debates about how technology shapes
human agency, cognition, and autonomy. The extended mind thesis (Clark
& Chalmers 1998) provides the foundational framework, arguing that
cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain into external tools and
artifacts. This raises questions about whether technological
augmentation diminishes or extends human capacities. Recent work
examines cognitive offloading—the delegation of cognitive tasks to
external devices—and its implications for intellectual virtue,
autonomy, and moral agency. A key debate concerns whether offloading
undermines cognitive skills and autonomy or merely reallocates mental
resources to more valuable tasks. Another strand examines how smart
technologies challenge traditional transparency ideals in tool use, and
how moral technologies might offload not just cognitive but also moral
tasks. The domain connects extended mind theory to practical questions
about digital assistants, smartphones, and AI-mediated decision-making.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is critical for distinguishing DIY from tool-assisted
action. If extended mind theory is correct, using tools doesn't
outsource tasks to something external—it extends the self. This
challenges the intuition that tool use differs fundamentally from human
delegation. The cognitive offloading literature addresses whether there
are morally relevant differences between using technology versus relying
on other people, particularly regarding autonomy and skill development.
Understanding how technology shapes agency clarifies what is lost or
gained when we delegate tasks to machines rather than doing them
ourselves.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most work focuses on cognitive and epistemic dimensions of offloading;
less attention to affective or embodied dimensions. Limited engagement
with how extended mind theory applies to collaborative tasks or
distributed agency. Few papers directly address the moral distinction
between tool use and interpersonal delegation. INCOMPLETE entries

bibliography for reference but are excluded from synthesis.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the debate between extended mind proponents and critics who
see offloading as diminishing agency. Distinguish cognitive offloading
(memory, calculation) from moral offloading (decision-making, judgment).
Consider how transparency and skillful use affect whether technology
extends or replaces the self.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Extended mind optimists (8 papers): Technology extends rather than replaces cognition
- Offloading skeptics (5 papers): Cognitive delegation threatens autonomy and skill
- Virtue epistemology critics (3 papers): Offloading undermines intellectual virtues
- Ethical technology designers (2 papers): Skillful use determines moral status

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cognitive processes can literally extend beyond the brain and skull to include environmental resources. When an external tool (like Otto's notebook) is reliably available, functionally integrated, and automatically endorsed, it constitutes part of the cognitive system rather than merely supporting it. Active externalism differs from semantic externalism by focusing on how the environment drives cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding whether tool use extends the self or delegates tasks externally. If tools extend cognition, then using technology doesn't outsource tasks to something other than the self—it reconfigures the boundaries of the cognitive agent. This challenges the DIY question's assumption that tool use differs categorically from doing things oneself. The parity principle (if external process plays same functional role as internal, it's cognitive) bears on whether using AI differs from human delegation.

  POSITION: Extended mind optimism—environmental resources can constitute cognition when properly integrated.

Some accept the intuitive demarcations of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words "just ain't in the head", and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We propose to pursue a third position. We will advocate an externalism about mind, but one that is in no way grounded in the debatable role of external reference in fixing the contents of our mental states. Rather, we advocate an *active externalism*, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cognitive offloading is paradigmatically intentional action, yet debates about extended cognition ignore this fact. Opposition to extended cognition stems partly from unarticulated intuitions about agency rooted in Davidson's interface model (intentions cause bodily movements). An Anscombean model of action—where actions express intentions only within appropriate teleologically structured contexts—better supports extended cognition by recognizing agency's general dependence on bodily and environmental settings.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how action theory shapes views of cognitive offloading. If offloading is genuine action (not mere causal enablement), then delegating to tools is doing something oneself in a different form. This challenges views that treat tool use as diminishing agency. The Anscombean framework suggests that doing things yourself doesn't require keeping all processes internal—what matters is the teleological structure integrating agent, body, and environment. Illuminates DIY questions about when using tools counts as doing it yourself.

  POSITION: Extended mind proponent using Anscombean action theory to defend cognitive offloading as genuine agency.

  abstract = {The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on ‘cognitive offloading’, HEC’s defenders claim that information processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is sometimes ‘genuinely’ cognitive. But while debates about offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of action as a kind of interface between separately constituted intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic. But while this view of agency has been popularised – most prominently by Donald Davidson – as analytic philosophy of action’s ‘standard story’, it has come under pressure from philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe’s very different account. According to this, actions express an agent’s intention only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically structured worldly context. In this paper, I’ll argue that HEC’s supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is, they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of human agency’s general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Excessive cognitive offloading to gadgets threatens intellectual autonomy, particularly the freedom to achieve intellectual goals independently. While offloading can enhance efficiency, overdependence undermines the capacity for autonomous intellectual achievement. Educational practices should cultivate balanced offloading that preserves students' freedom to achieve rather than maximizing delegation.

  RELEVANCE: Applies extended mind debates to education and autonomy. Distinguishes between efficiency gains from offloading and autonomy costs from overdependence. Relevant to DIY questions because it identifies when delegation (even to tools) diminishes valuable capacities. The "freedom to achieve" framework suggests that what matters morally about doing things yourself isn't just the outcome but the preserved capacity for independent achievement.

  doi = {10.1007/s00146-018-0824-x},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditional extended mind theory assumes tool transparency (expert tool use involves phenomenological disappearance of the tool). However, smart technologies with AI-based applications resist transparency—they "reappear" in conscious experience because their autonomous behavior requires monitoring. This challenges whether contemporary smart technology can extend the mind in the classical sense and raises questions about design goals for AI systems.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies how AI and smart technology differ from traditional tools regarding extended cognition. If smart tools inherently resist transparency, this affects whether using AI counts as extending the self versus delegating to an external agent. The "reappearing tool" phenomenon suggests AI-assisted action differs phenomenologically and possibly morally from traditional tool use. Relevant to whether moral distinctions between human delegation and AI delegation track differences in transparency or integration.

  abstract = {Some thinkers have claimed that expert performance with technology is characterized by a kind of disappearance of that technology from conscious experience, that is, by the transparency of the tools and equipment through which we sense and manipulate the world. This is a claim that may be traced to phenomenological philosophers such as Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, but it has been influential in user interface design where the transparency of technology has often been adopted as a mark of good design. Moreover, in the philosophy of cognitive science, such transparency has been advanced as necessary for extended cognition (the situation in which the technology with which we couple genuinely counts as a constitutive part of our cognitive machinery, along with our brains). By reflecting on concrete examples of our contemporary engagement with technology, I shall argue that the epistemic challenges posed by smart artefacts (those that come equipped with artificial-intelligence-based applications) should prompt a reassessment of the drive for transparency in the design of some cases of technology-involving cognition. This has consequences for the place of extended minds in the contemporary technological context.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Brain-computer interfaces (neuromedia) that enable cognitive offloading threaten intellectual perseverance—the virtue of mentally persisting through challenges toward intellectual goals. Excessive offloading incentivized by neuromedia undermines virtue development by removing the challenges that cultivate perseverance. However, responsible use might reallocate perseverance to more valuable intellectual pursuits by eliminating menial cognitive labor.

  RELEVANCE: Extends virtue epistemology critique of offloading to future technologies. Identifies intellectual perseverance as specifically threatened by cognitive delegation, suggesting that doing things yourself (cognitively) cultivates virtues that delegation erodes. The conditional defense (offloading acceptable if redirecting perseverance) relates to DIY questions about whether delegation's value depends on what one does with freed cognitive resources. Challenges simple efficiency-based defenses of technological augmentation.

I analyze how neuromedia is poised to negatively affect the intellectual character of agents, focusing specifically on the virtue of intellectual perseverance, which involves a disposition to mentally persist in the face of challenges towards the realization of one’s intellectual goals. First, I present and motivate what I call ‘the cognitive offloading argument’, which holds that excessive cognitive offloading of the sort incentivized by a device like neuromedia threatens to undermine intellectual virtue development from the standpoint of the theory of virtue responsibilism. Then, I examine the cognitive offloading argument as it applies to the virtue of intellectual perseverance, arguing that neuromedia may increase cognitive efficiency at the cost of intellectual perseverance. If used in an epistemically responsible manner, however, cognitive offloading devices may not undermine intellectual perseverance but instead allow people to persevere with respect to intellectual goals that they find more valuable by freeing them from different kinds of menial intellectual labor.},

  doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01251},

  CORE ARGUMENT: The ethical status of consciousness-altering technologies depends on the skill with which they are used. Drawing on Dreyfus's phenomenology of expertise, the paper argues that skillful technology use involves embodied, pre-reflective integration rather than deliberative control. Ethical evaluation should focus on cultivating skillful use rather than prohibiting or mandating particular technologies.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces skill and expertise as mediating factors in how technology affects consciousness and agency. Suggests that whether tool use extends or diminishes the self depends on how skillfully the tool is integrated. Relevant to DIY questions because it implies moral significance depends not just on whether one uses tools but on the quality of integration. Skillful tool use might preserve agency while unskillful use constitutes genuine outsourcing. Bridges extended mind theory and virtue ethics.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended mind technologies raise distinctive ethical concerns about mental privacy (external cognitive states more vulnerable to surveillance), manipulation (cognitive artifacts can be altered by third parties), and agency (distinguishing genuine extended agency from mere tool use or control by external actors). These concerns require ethical frameworks beyond standard bioethics approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Identifies ethical risks specific to extended cognition. The agency discussion addresses when offloading to technology genuinely extends the self versus creating vulnerability to external control. Relevant to DIY questions about whether using tools preserves agency or creates dependence on external systems potentially controlled by others. The privacy and manipulation concerns suggest moral differences between internal processes and extended cognition, even if both are genuinely cognitive.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Moral technologies (bioenhancement, nudges, ambient persuasive tech) could offload moral decision-making and reduce moral struggle. Critics worry this threatens moral progress, which depends on difficult deliberation. However, moral progress is better understood as discovering and applying new values, not as struggle itself. Eliminating moral struggle through technology doesn't undermine progress and may enable it by freeing cognitive resources.

  RELEVANCE: Extends offloading debates from cognitive to moral domain. Argues that offloading moral tasks to technology doesn't necessarily diminish moral agency or progress. Relevant to DIY questions because it challenges the assumption that doing things yourself (morally deliberating, resisting temptation) is intrinsically valuable. If moral struggle's value is instrumental, then technological assistance that achieves the same ends without struggle isn't morally worse—potentially analogous argument for cognitive offloading.

  abstract = {Moral bioenhancement, nudge-designed environments, and ambient persuasive technologies may help people behave more consistently with their deeply held moral convictions. Alternatively, they may aid people in overcoming cognitive and affective limitations that prevent them from appreciating a situation’s moral dimensions. Or they may simply make it easier for them to make the morally right choice by helping them to overcome sources of weakness of will. This paper makes two assumptions. First, technologies to improve people’s moral capacities are realizable. Second, such technologies will actually help people get morality right and behave more consistently with whatever the ‘real’ right thing to do turns out to be. The paper then considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable, particularly opportunities for moral progress, when being moral is made much easier by eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle. Ultimately, the worry that moral struggle has value as a catalyst for moral progress is rejected. Moral progress is understood here as the discovery and application of new values or sensitization to new sources of harm.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Technology drives moral revolutions—radical group-level moral change—through mechanisms including stabilizing/destabilizing moral systems and making morally salient phenomena visible or invisible. Case studies (firearms, contraception, factory farming, agriculture) reveal how technology constructs moral niches and creates moral payoff mechanisms that incentivize new moral norms. Technomoral revolutions involve complex interactions between material affordances and moral systems.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates technology's capacity to transform moral practices and norms, not just support them. Relevant to DIY questions because it shows how technology changes what counts as valuable agency, not just how efficiently we achieve pre-existing goals. If technology reshapes moral salience and moral systems, then using technology versus doing things yourself isn't merely instrumental—it can alter what we value about human action. The niche construction framework applies to how AI and digital assistants might reshape agency and delegation norms.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The power of technology to transform religions, science, and political institutions has often been presented as nothing short of revolutionary. Does technology have a similarly transformative influence on societies’ morality? Scholars have not rigorously investigated the role of technology in moral revolutions, even though existing research on technomoral change suggests that this role may be considerable. In this paper, we explore what the role of technology in moral revolutions, understood as processes of radical group-level moral change, amounts to. We do so by investigating four historical episodes of radical moral change in which technology plays a noteworthy role. Our case-studies illustrate the plurality of mechanisms involved in technomoral revolutions, but also suggest general patterns of technomoral change, such as technology’s capacity to stabilize and destabilize moral systems, and to make morally salient phenomena visible or invisible. We find several leads to expand and refine conceptual tools for analysing moral change, specifically by crystallizing the notions of ‘technomoral niche construction’ and ‘moral payoff mechanisms’. Coming to terms with the role of technology in radical moral change, we argue, enriches our understanding of moral revolutions, and alerts us to the depths of which technology can change our societies in wanted and unwanted ways.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended mind theory undermines the posthumanist/transhumanist assumption that radical technological enhancement creates a new kind of being. If cognition has always extended beyond biological boundaries through tool use, then contemporary technological augmentation represents degree rather than kind of change. There is no sharp boundary between "natural" human and "technologically enhanced" posthuman.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the assumption that using technology fundamentally alters human nature or agency. Suggests continuity between traditional tool use and AI-assisted action. Relevant to DIY questions because if extended mind theory is correct, the distinction between doing things yourself and using tools is less fundamental than it appears—both involve extended cognitive systems. However, this may collapse important moral distinctions between self-reliant and technologically dependent agency.

Relevant to DIY questions because it suggests using technology doesn't fundamentally alter what it means to act or be human.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended mind thesis conflates constitutive and causal contributions to cognition. External resources causally support but don't constitute cognitive processes.

  abstract = {The present collection of essays contains illuminating discussions of a range of issues around cognition, self and agency. The introduction, written by Don Ross, has the title "Science Catches the Will", and this title provides a good clue to the focal point of the collection and also to the conception of the terrain we find in many of the essays; there is something here we ought to catch, and we ought to catch it by a scientific approach. Putting things like this, we immediately invite a number of further questions, among them questions about what the will is supposed to be, what central philosophers have thought that it is, what science is, and whether science thus understood carries the right approach to the major aspects of the questions raised. That in its turn brings up general questions about the relationship between science and philosophy. While there is no doubt that good philosophy is in deep need of being informed by and fully responsive to developments in science, there is a similar requirement that scientists approaching philosophical issues be responsive to the state of the art and to the nature of the philosophical problems. There are no sharp lines between science and philosophy; the important thing is always to know what you are doing and to do it well.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

There are fourteen good essays here, and the collection is an outgrowth of interaction over some time. The authors are mainly philosophers, all of them with wide interests in neighboring disciplines, many of them with research contributions of great significance in a much wider field than what is called philosophy. Some of the contributors are not professional philosophers; their work is nevertheless philosophical in nature and/or of great relevance to philosophical theorizing.

Looking back at the last fifty years of philosophy of mind and action, we see Davidson and Anscombe as very important contributors to work on and about the will at the beginning of this period. We see them engaging with questions about the will as it was conceived of by earlier philosophers, and we see both agreements and disagreement between them. The present collection starts from Davidson, and many contributors see him as someone who attempted to make room for naturalism by seeing reasons as causes, and, as one contributor, Miriam Thalos, puts it, "He sought to do justice to the idea of agency as ownership over behavior, while nonetheless preserving a basis for some semblance of a science of action" (p. 125 in her essay "The Sources of Behavior"). This idea of ownership is developed like this: "What is mine about a piece of behavior, among the scientifically minded nowadays, is the pro attitude that I direct towards it, in the form of a mental state" (p. 126).

Thalos, in her essay, builds her own position partly by contrasting her views with Davidson's. In particular, she argues against Davidson by trying to undermine what she calls his motivationalism. She presents a simple principle she sees as closely connected with Davidson's principles, and provides a counterexample to it. Her principle states that if you intend to do something, you are able to do it; if no new considerations arise, and you are not prevented from doing it, then you do it.

Of course there are counterexamples to this simple principle, and she provides one where you get lost in thought while driving away to do shopping, and arrive at your workplace instead of at the store. She foresees a Davidsonian response; that arriving at your workplace was not an intentional action. Davidson, when accounting for agency, was aiming for an account of doing something intentionally. Davidson only wants to be committed to the view that you in fact go for the act you want most if you intentionally carry out one of the acts you consider. Therefore, this counterexample to Thalos's principle might not undermine Davidson's position; he might have no reason to think her principle is true or something that is entailed by his views. Thalos holds such a reply to be "unworthy and implausible" (p. 130), since arriving at the workplace was an action in the present example.

Here, it seems to me, Davidson has a further reply that is not an implausible one. Arriving at the workplace was an action also on his account: the result of many "smaller" things we did intentionally while driving. There are on Davidson's picture many things we do in virtue of doing something else. Sometimes we do indeed intend to do A, get lost in thought, do many things intentionally, but fail to do A, and do B instead. Then doing B is an action, but not necessarily something we do intentionally; it might be an unintended result of doing many other things intentionally. It seems to me that this reply works for this case, and that Davidson avoids this particular criticism from Thalos.

There is, I think, a genuine issue about how good the Davidsonian approach is at providing understanding in cases of routine, cases where we act on "auto-pilot", but that is a different matter from the question of whether his account of agency and of doing something intentionally faces a real problem from this particular type of counterexample.

What seems to be happening throughout Thalos's extremely rich essay is that she is pursuing a theory of agency that is different in scope from that considered by Davidson, Anscombe, and others. She also pursues very many dimensions of agency, and is instructively inspired by Michael Bratman. If, however, agency is not restricted to what we do intentionally, many of the problems look very different, and so do the connections between reasons and actions in the account of agency. To illustrate: Davidson gave up giving necessary and sufficient conditions for agency because of the possibility of deviant causal chains. Thalos does not really discuss deviance, and maybe this indicates that the focus has shifted. Maybe her notion of agency does not face this problem at all, with the consequence that the climber who lets the rope go, startled by the thought that this is a possibility, acts in her sense of acting (or exhibiting agency) without intentionally letting the rope go.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cognition is best understood through dynamical systems theory and ecological psychology rather than computational representationalism. Radical embodiment rejects mental representation entirely—cognition emerges from agent-environment dynamics without requiring internal representations. This more thoroughly embodied view goes beyond extended mind to question cognitivism itself.

  RELEVANCE: Offers alternative to both traditional cognitivism and extended mind theory. If cognition is fundamentally embodied dynamical coupling rather than computation (whether internal or extended), this reshapes questions about technology and agency. Using tools doesn't extend computational processes but reconfigures dynamical couplings. Relevant to DIY questions because it suggests agency involves embodied engagement rather than computational processing location—doing things yourself might require appropriate embodied coupling regardless of tool use.

  POSITION: Radical embodied cognition—rejects representationalism underlying extended mind debates.

Includes both defenders and critics examining empirical and conceptual issues.

  RELEVANCE: Comprehensive overview of extended mind debates circa 2010. Relevant to DIY questions because it examines what cognitive integration requires—mere coupling versus deeper constitutional integration. The cognitive integration framework (how social and cultural practices scaffold cognition) applies to how organizational tools and AI systems might extend rather than replace agency.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended cognition requires identifying a "mark of the cognitive"—necessary and sufficient conditions for cognitive status. Defends extended cognition against internalist critics by arguing that what makes processes cognitive isn't their location but their functional role in producing and transforming information-bearing structures. External processes can meet this functional criterion when appropriately integrated.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses central debate about what makes cognition cognitive and whether location matters. Relevant to DIY questions because it identifies functional integration as key—if external processes play the right functional role, they constitute cognition regardless of location. This suggests tool use can extend the self rather than delegate to something external when functional integration is sufficient. However, what counts as "appropriate integration" remains contested.

First, it argues that these objections all reduce to one basic sort: all the objections can be resolved by the provision of an adequate and properly motivated criterion—or mark—of the cognitive.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extended mind theory has developed through three waves. First wave (parity principle): if external plays same role as internal, it's cognitive. Second wave (complementarity): external resources need not replicate internal processes but complement them. Third wave (predictive processing + enactivism): extended cognition emerges from prediction-driven dynamics. Each wave solves problems with previous approaches but faces new challenges.

  RELEVANCE: Surveys evolution of extended mind theory and current state of debates. The three-wave framework helps locate different arguments about cognitive offloading. First wave supports strong extension claims; second wave allows looser integration; third wave emphasizes dynamical embodied processes. Relevant to DIY questions because different waves have different implications for when tool use extends versus outsources cognition—affects whether using AI counts as doing things yourself.

The fact that the hypothesis continues to spark debate and to generate both new insights and new objections suggests that it continues to play a productive role in contemporary philosophy of mind.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Internet search engines affect intellectual character and virtue development. Excessive reliance on search can undermine memory, intellectual perseverance, and open-mindedness by providing easy answers and algorithmic filtering. However, skillful search use can enhance intellectual virtues by providing diverse perspectives and epistemic resources. Educational practices should cultivate virtuous search habits.

  RELEVANCE: Applies virtue epistemology to specific technology (search engines). Identifies how cognitive offloading to search affects intellectual character—relevant to whether technological delegation undermines or enables virtue. The dual potential (undermining or enhancing virtue depending on use) suggests context and skill matter more than offloading per se. Relevant to DIY questions about whether using search differs morally from consulting human experts or doing research yourself.

  POSITION: Virtue epistemology framework applied to internet search—conditional on skillful use.

  abstract = {This paper applies a virtue epistemology approach to using the Internet, as to improve our information-seeking behaviours. Virtue epistemology focusses on the cognitive character of agents and is less concerned with the nature of truth and epistemic justification as compared to traditional analytic epistemology. Due to this focus on cognitive character and agency, it is a fruitful but underexplored approach to using the Internet in an epistemically desirable way. Thus, the central question in this paper is: How to use the Internet in an epistemically virtuous way? Using the work of Jason Baehr, it starts by outlining nine intellectual or epistemic virtues: curiosity, intellectual autonomy, intellectual humility, attentiveness, intellectual carefulness, intellectual thoroughness, open-mindedness, intellectual courage and intellectual tenacity. It then explores how we should deploy these virtues and avoid the corresponding vices when interacting with the Internet, particularly search engines. Whilst an epistemically virtuous use of the Internet will not guarantee that one will acquire true beliefs, understanding or even knowledge, it will strongly improve one’s information-seeking behaviours. The paper ends with arguing that teaching and assessing online intellectual virtues should be part of school and university curricula, perhaps embedded in critical thinking courses, or even better, as individual units.},
