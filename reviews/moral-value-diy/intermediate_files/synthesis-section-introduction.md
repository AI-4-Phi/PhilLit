## Introduction

Contemporary life increasingly involves decisions about delegation and self-reliance. Should I repair my own appliances or hire a technician? Should I form moral beliefs through independent reflection or defer to trusted advisors? Should I rely on AI assistants for cognitive tasks or perform them myself? These questions cluster around a deeper philosophical issue: whether doing things yourself has moral value beyond instrumental efficiency and outcome quality. If two actions produce identical results, does it matter morally whether I performed the action myself or had another person—or an AI system—do it for me?

This question has become increasingly urgent as technological and economic changes reshape the landscape of agency. Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented cognitive offloading, from memory augmentation to decision support (Clark and Chalmers 1998; Wheeler 2018). The gig economy makes delegation of household and personal tasks frictionless and affordable. Meanwhile, scientific knowledge has become so specialized that epistemic self-reliance appears not merely difficult but literally impossible (Kitcher 1990; Buzzell and Rini 2022). These developments force us to confront what, if anything, is lost when we outsource activities that previous generations performed themselves.

Yet philosophical resources for addressing the moral value of doing things yourself remain fragmented. Autonomy theory addresses when agents act freely but says less about whether the physical execution of action matters for autonomous agency (Frankfurt 1971; Garnett 2023). Authenticity theory emphasizes self-authorship through choice but struggles to explain whether delegating tasks undermines genuine self-expression (Taylor 1992; Mogensen 2015). Virtue ethics suggests character develops through practice, but whether virtues require personal performance or can be cultivated through well-chosen delegation remains contested (Annas 2011; Schuster 2023). Meanwhile, relational autonomy theorists challenge whether self-sufficiency is even desirable, arguing that autonomy develops through rather than despite interdependence (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000; Westlund 2009).

This review synthesizes philosophical debates bearing on the moral value of doing things yourself. It clarifies three key distinctions essential for navigating these debates. First, the distinction between process-value and outcome-value: activities may matter morally not just for what they produce but for how they engage the agent. Second, the distinction between personal agency and instrumental efficiency: doing things yourself may preserve forms of agency distinct from mere causal control over outcomes. Third, the distinction between tool use and human delegation: using technology to extend one's capabilities may differ morally from having other people perform tasks on one's behalf (Clark and Chalmers 1998; Kutz 2000).

The review proceeds in four sections. Section 1 examines arguments that doing things yourself has distinctive moral value grounded in autonomy, authenticity, and genuine agency. These perspectives emphasize that self-directed action preserves the connection between reflective will and executed behavior, enables self-authorship through active engagement, and develops autonomous capacities. Section 2 presents systematic challenges to self-reliance, drawing on relational autonomy theories, division of cognitive labor arguments, and frameworks of shared agency and distributed responsibility. These perspectives argue that interdependence can manifest rather than undermine autonomy, that epistemic self-reliance is often impossible or harmful, and that delegation can preserve or appropriately distribute responsibility. Section 3 addresses when and why process matters beyond outcomes, focusing on meaningful work, virtue acquisition through practice, and alienation from one's productive activities. Finally, Section 4 identifies objections to the research proposal and critical tensions within the literature, examining when delegation is superior to DIY, internal contradictions between different grounds for DIY value, and the context-dependence that may resist systematic theorizing about self-reliance.
