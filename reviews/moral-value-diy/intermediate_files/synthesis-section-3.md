## When Process Matters—Meaningful Work, Virtue Acquisition, and Character Development

The debate between self-reliance and delegation assumes sharpest focus when we ask whether the activity itself—not just its outcomes—has moral significance. Three theoretical frameworks address this question: meaningful work theories that identify when productive activities contribute to flourishing, virtue-as-skill models that suggest character development requires personal practice, and alienation theory that reveals how inability to appropriate one's activities represents a loss regardless of product quality.

### Meaningful Work—Process and Outcome Values

Contemporary accounts of meaningful work recognize multiple dimensions through which work contributes to flourishing. Veltman (2016) develops a pluralistic framework identifying meaningful work as combining subjective experience, autonomy and skill exercise, social contribution, and recognition from others. This pluralism captures how work matters both processually (through autonomous engagement of capacities) and consequentially (through valued social contribution). Whether doing things yourself preserves work's meaningfulness depends on which dimensions matter most in particular contexts.

Van der Deijl (2022) sharpens this analysis by distinguishing quality-meaningfulness (work good for the worker—autonomous, engaging, using skills) from significance-meaningfulness (work good for others—making valuable contributions). These dimensions can come apart: assembly line work may have high significance but low quality; an absorbing personal hobby may have high quality but low significance. This distinction directly addresses the delegation question. Personal DIY projects may preserve quality-meaningfulness through autonomous skill exercise while forfeiting significance-meaningfulness if outcomes serve only oneself. Conversely, delegation may preserve contributive value while sacrificing developmental engagement.

The relationship between process and outcome values remains contested. Muirhead (2007) prioritizes social contribution over self-realization, arguing that work's meaning comes from serving others rather than from subjective satisfaction or capacity development. This outcome-oriented view suggests delegation is less problematic provided social contribution persists. However, Schwartz (1982) emphasizes objectification—seeing one's thought embodied in products through engaging activity—as requiring complex capacity exercise throughout production. Fragmented or delegated work prevents this objectification even when outcomes are valuable. Schwartz's emphasis on exercising capacities across the production process provides stronger grounds for process-value.

Kandiyali (2020) complicates both individualist and outcome-focused accounts through her reading of Marx. Unalienated production is essentially social: it requires producing for others who appreciate one's work, not solitary self-realization. Meaningful work combines four features: freely chosen, involving self-realization through capacity development, intended to satisfy others' needs, and appropriately appreciated by those others. This account suggests purely personal DIY projects lacking social recognition may fail to realize work's full value. Yet it also suggests delegation could preserve meaning if it maintains relations of mutual recognition—the question is not who performs physical actions but whether production involves appropriate social relationships.

Gheaus and Herzog (2016) identify multiple work-goods that delegation may affect differently: excellence in activity, social contribution, community and recognition, and self-realization. Delegation might preserve some goods (contribution, possibly recognition) while sacrificing others (excellence in activity, self-realization). Whether this trade-off is acceptable depends on the relative importance of these goods and their availability elsewhere in one's life. If meaningful work is not universally required by justice—as Arneson (2009) argues from an anti-perfectionist perspective—then choices about delegation become matters of personal preference or prudence rather than moral obligation. However, if meaningful work opportunities are necessary for self-respect and thus required by justice, as defenders like Veltman argue, then access to engaging productive activities becomes morally significant beyond mere income distribution.

### The Virtue-as-Skill Debate

If virtues are analogous to skills, doing things yourself appears constitutive of character excellence. Annas (2011) argues that virtues develop through practice guided by understanding, just as musical or athletic skills do. Like expert skills, virtues involve feedback, correction, and gradual integration into practical reasoning. Stichter (2011) elaborates how skill-like virtues enable flexible practical wisdom through integrated practical knowledge developed experientially. You cannot become virtuous by having others act virtuously for you any more than you can become a skilled pianist by having someone else practice.

However, the virtue-as-skill analogy faces substantial challenges. Schuster (2023) argues that ordinary skills provide a plausible model of practical reason only when assessed by agent-independent standards—but this undermines agent-centered virtue ethics that rejects such external standards. If the skill model serves its purpose, virtue must likewise be assessed primarily by agent-independent moral standards rather than agent-centered considerations about character. Kilov (2023) identifies a different problem: expert skills are "brittle"—narrow and context-bound, faltering in novel situations. This contradicts virtue ethics' claim that virtues enable good action flexibly across contexts. If skills are brittle, then skill-like practice may develop only narrow competencies rather than robust moral character.

Defenders of the skill model address these challenges by emphasizing the role of practical wisdom (phronesis) and internal motivation. Krettenauer and Stichter (2023) integrate skill development with self-regulation theory, arguing that virtue acquisition requires deliberate practice motivated by moral identity goals. Practice succeeds in developing virtue only when sustained by internal commitment to being a moral person. This suggests you cannot outsource the motivational work needed for character formation—virtue development requires self-motivated engagement with moral challenges. Sanderse (2018) argues that Aristotelian habituation continues throughout life, not just childhood. Adult virtue requires ongoing wisdom-guided practice where agents confirm and deepen virtuous habits through continued action. If habituation is lifelong, doing things yourself may remain important for maintaining and developing virtue even in mature agents.

Vallor (2016) addresses how emerging technologies reshape practices through which virtues are cultivated. Technologies can impair virtue development by reducing opportunities for practice or support it through wise design. Technomoral virtues adapted to contemporary conditions still require cultivation through practice, though the specific practices may differ from traditional contexts. This suggests virtue acquisition depends on appropriate practice opportunities—if technologies or delegation eliminate those practices, character formation may suffer.

Even if the virtue-as-skill analogy holds partially, questions remain about which activities cultivate virtue and whether all tasks require personal performance. The analogy provides strongest support for DIY when activities involve moral challenges requiring practical wisdom, sustained effort through difficulty, or emotional regulation. Routine tasks lacking these features may not significantly contribute to virtue development whether performed personally or delegated.

### Alienation and Appropriation

Alienation theory reveals a different dimension of process-value. Jaeggi (2014) reconstructs alienation as inability to appropriate one's relations to self, others, activity, and world—a relation of relationlessness where one is involved but cannot make it one's own. This extends beyond Marx's focus on wage labor to any domain where subjects cannot identify with what they're doing. Applied to delegation, Jaeggi's framework suggests that having others perform activities on your behalf may prevent appropriation even when outcomes align with your preferences. If you cannot make the activity your own—because you did not perform it, did not understand it, or could not identify with the process—you experience alienation.

Arendt (1958) distinguishes labor (cyclical biological necessity consumed immediately) from work (creating durable objects that build a human world). Work has world-building value beyond mere consumption: it creates stable artifacts that mediate human relationships and provide permanence. This distinction addresses what makes productive activity valuable. If work's significance lies in world-building through durable object-creation, then who performs the work matters less than whether lasting artifacts are produced. However, Arendt's emphasis on homo faber as realizing humanity through making suggests the process of creating durable things may itself be valuable, not merely the resulting world of artifacts.

Sayers (2005) defends Marx's view that productive labor is essential to human nature against critics who emphasize leisure or consumption. Work is not merely instrumental but constitutive of distinctively human existence: transforming nature, developing capacities, creating a human world. If productive activity is essential to human flourishing, delegation represents a loss regardless of outcomes. However, this depends on work being unalienated—free, creative, autonomous. Coerced or fragmented labor does not realize work's potential. Whether all productive activity has intrinsic value or only certain kinds (creative, complex, autonomous) remains disputed.

The social dimension complicates alienation theory's implications for DIY. As Kandiyali emphasizes, unalienated production requires recognition from others who appreciate one's work. Purely solitary DIY lacking social contribution may itself be alienating despite involving personal performance. The question is not simply whether you do something yourself but whether you can appropriate the activity as yours within meaningful social relationships. Delegation to others could maintain these relationships—shared agency, mutual recognition, collective accomplishment—while pure self-reliance might forfeit them.

### When Process Has Distinctive Value

These three frameworks converge on the insight that whether process matters beyond outcomes depends on context. Meaningful work theories suggest process-value inheres particularly in activities involving autonomy, skill exercise, and capacity development—delegation forfeits these goods even when contribution persists. However, not all work involves these features, and contributive value may sometimes outweigh quality-meaningfulness. The virtue-as-skill model, despite challenges, suggests character development requires personal engagement with moral challenges and sustained practice through difficulty—you cannot become virtuous by delegating virtue-requiring actions to others. Yet routine tasks may not significantly develop virtue whether performed personally or delegated. Alienation theory reveals that inability to appropriate activities prevents self-realization regardless of product quality, but appropriation may require social relationships and recognition rather than mere personal performance.

The key unresolved tension concerns whether process-value inheres in all productive activity or only in specific kinds. If only certain activities—creative, complex, virtue-developing, socially recognized—have distinctive process-value, then delegation of routine tasks is unproblematic while delegation of meaningful activities forfeits something valuable. However, if productive activity is essential to human nature as such, then widespread delegation threatens human flourishing even when outcomes are preserved. The research must clarify which features of activities ground process-value and when delegation is morally preferable, permissible, or problematic.
