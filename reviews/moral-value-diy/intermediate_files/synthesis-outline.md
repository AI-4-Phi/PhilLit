## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the moral and philosophical significance of doing things yourself versus delegating to others, establishing key distinctions and preview of major debates.

**Content**:
- Framing the DIY question: distinguish process-value (the activity itself) from outcome-value (the results produced), and personal agency from instrumental efficiency
- Contemporary urgency: AI assistance, automation, cognitive offloading, and gig economy delegation make this question increasingly practical
- Scope clarification: focus on voluntary delegation contexts rather than coerced labor, and distinguish tool use from human delegation
- Preview of debate structure: autonomy and authenticity perspectives defending DIY; relational and efficiency critiques challenging self-reliance; meaningful work and virtue theories addressing when process matters; responsibility considerations

**Key Papers**: Frankfurt 1971 (autonomy foundations), Clark & Chalmers 1998 (extended mind), Kutz 2000 (complicity and delegation), Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000 (relational autonomy), Kitcher 1990 (division of cognitive labor)

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: The Case for Doing It Yourself—Autonomy, Authenticity, and Agency

**Section Purpose**: Establish philosophical arguments that doing things yourself has distinctive moral value grounded in autonomy, authentic self-authorship, and genuine agency.

**Main Claims**:
1. Hierarchical autonomy theories suggest doing things yourself preserves the connection between higher-order endorsement and action execution
2. Authenticity as self-making through choice implies that delegating forfeits opportunities for genuine self-authorship
3. Extended mind theory complicates but does not fully dissolve the distinction between using tools and delegating to human agents

**Subsection 1.1: Autonomy and Self-Determination**

**Papers**: Frankfurt 1971, Garnett 2023, Killmister 2017, Bratman 2003, Watson 1975

**Content**: Frankfurt's hierarchical model where autonomous action flows from reflective endorsement establishes baseline for why personal execution may matter. Garnett's argument that systematic practical deference constitutes interpersonal rule directly addresses when delegation undermines autonomy. Killmister's multidimensional framework (self-definition, self-realization, self-unification, self-constitution) allows analysis of how delegation affects different autonomy dimensions differently—perhaps delegation compromises self-realization (acting on values through own efforts) while preserving self-definition. Bratman's planning theory suggests autonomous agents maintain coherent plans about which domains they govern directly versus delegate.

**Connection**: If autonomy requires that action flow from one's own reflective endorsement through one's own agency, delegation may sever this connection even when outcomes align with one's values. However, questions remain about whether control over delegation decisions suffices for autonomy.

**Subsection 1.2: Authenticity and Self-Authorship**

**Papers**: Taylor 1992, Guignon 2004, Bauer 2021, Mogensen 2015, Rodriguez Apolito 2022

**Content**: Taylor's reconstruction of authenticity as requiring self-transcendence through engagement with horizons of significance suggests that doing things yourself matters when activities connect to inter-subjective values. Bauer's distinction between essentialist authenticity (discovering true nature) and existentialist authenticity (self-making through action) reveals that only existentialist accounts clearly support DIY—self-authorship occurs through the process of doing. Mogensen's analysis of moral testimony reveals that resistance to deferring moral judgment stems from authenticity ideals: we value forming beliefs ourselves because they must originate in us to have proper authority. Rodriguez Apolito's critique warns that authenticity requirements can obscure oppression—doing things "oneself" may reflect internalized oppressive conditioning rather than genuine self-direction.

**Connection**: Authenticity grounds process-value: if self-authorship requires active self-making through choices and actions, delegating represents lost opportunities for becoming who one is. However, authenticity can come apart from autonomy, and may not always track genuine agency.

**Subsection 1.3: Technology, Tools, and Extended Agency**

**Papers**: Clark & Chalmers 1998, Britten-Neish 2025, Wheeler 2018, Carter 2018, Turner 2022

**Content**: Extended mind thesis challenges whether using tools constitutes "doing it yourself" or delegating to external systems. If cognitive processes extend beyond brain to include environmental resources when properly integrated, tool use doesn't outsource—it reconfigures cognitive boundaries. Britten-Neish's Anscombean analysis suggests offloading is genuine action when embedded in appropriate teleological structures. However, Wheeler identifies how smart technologies with autonomous AI resist transparency and "reappear" in conscious experience, suggesting contemporary AI-assistance differs from traditional tool use. Carter argues excessive cognitive offloading threatens intellectual autonomy by undermining freedom to achieve independently. Turner identifies how offloading undermines intellectual perseverance—the virtue of persisting through cognitive challenges.

**Connection**: Extended mind theory initially seems to dissolve DIY questions by showing tools extend rather than replace agency. However, criticisms based on autonomy loss, virtue erosion, and the distinctive character of opaque smart technologies suggest the boundaries between self and external resources matter morally even if they're not metaphysically sharp.

**Section Summary**: Autonomy, authenticity, and agency considerations provide grounds for thinking doing things yourself has distinctive value: it preserves the connection between reflective will and action, enables self-authorship through active engagement, and develops autonomous capacities. However, these arguments face challenges: delegation with proper control may preserve autonomy; authenticity ideals can reflect oppression; and tool integration complicates agency boundaries. **Key unresolved tension**: whether what matters is WHO performs the action (you vs. others) or WHETHER the outcome reflects your will.

## Section 2: The Case Against Self-Reliance—Relationality, Division of Labor, and Expertise

**Section Purpose**: Present systematic challenges to valorizing self-reliance, emphasizing relational autonomy, epistemic dependence, and the virtues of appropriate delegation.

**Main Claims**:
1. Relational autonomy theories show that autonomy requires rather than excludes supportive relationships and interdependence
2. Division of cognitive labor arguments demonstrate that epistemic self-reliance is impossible and often epistemically inferior to expert reliance
3. Complicity and shared agency frameworks suggest delegation need not diminish responsibility when properly structured

**Subsection 2.1: Relational Autonomy and the Critique of Self-Sufficiency**

**Papers**: Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000, Nedelsky 1989, Westlund 2009, Khader 2020, Humphries 2025, Friedman 2003, Held 2006

**Content**: Mackenzie and Stoljar's foundational collection establishes that autonomy is compatible with—and may require—social relationships and embeddedness rather than independence. Nedelsky argues traditional liberal autonomy grounded in property-based boundaries emphasizes separation, but genuine autonomy requires self-determination within relationships. Westlund's dialogical account holds that autonomy requires holding oneself answerable to external critical perspectives—pure self-reliance without responsiveness to others may undermine autonomy. However, Khader's internal feminist critique warns that socially constitutive relational autonomy risks paternalism toward oppressed people by making autonomy dependent on idealized social conditions. Humphries defends against this, arguing that recognizing genuine constraints on autonomy is realistic rather than paternalistic. Held's care ethics fundamentally challenges individualism by treating interdependence as morally basic rather than threatening.

**Connection**: If autonomy is constituted through rather than despite social relationships, then self-reliance may not be the autonomy-enhancing ideal it appears. Accepting help and mutual aid may manifest rather than undermine autonomy. However, there's internal debate about whether this risks denying agency to those in oppressive conditions who rely on themselves.

**Subsection 2.2: The Impossibility and Irresponsibility of Epistemic Self-Reliance**

**Papers**: Kitcher 1990, Buzzell & Rini 2022, Keren 2018, Nguyen 2018, Alexander et al. 2015, Carter 2017

**Content**: Kitcher's foundational argument shows scientific communities achieve epistemic progress through division of labor where scientists pursue different approaches—social dependence enhances epistemic achievement. Buzzell and Rini's analysis of "doing your own research" reveals it as impossible and dangerous: information overload combined with individualistic epistemic ideals leads to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Keren argues scientific education should cultivate "competent outsiders" who can evaluate expertise rather than attempting self-reliant mastery. Nguyen identifies how hyper-specialization creates "cognitive islands" where even experts cannot evaluate cross-field arguments. Alexander et al. provide critical nuance showing benefits of division of labor are conditional on epistemic landscape features. Carter argues intellectual autonomy doesn't require self-reliance but rather appropriate delegation while maintaining self-direction.

**Connection**: In complex knowledge domains, attempting self-reliance is epistemically irresponsible. "Doing it yourself" epistemically means cultivating competent reliance on experts, not attempting independent mastery. This challenges whether DIY represents virtue or vice in epistemic contexts.

**Subsection 2.3: Shared Agency and Distributed Responsibility**

**Papers**: Kutz 2000, Bratman 1992, Bratman 2014, Jensen 2018, Mellema 2016, Schmitz & Bryson 2025

**Content**: Kutz's complicity principle argues individuals bear responsibility for outcomes they participate in regardless of causal contribution—delegation doesn't absolve responsibility. Bratman's planning theory of shared agency shows delegation can involve interlocking intentions constituting genuine shared action rather than mere causal manipulation. Jensen examines cases where becoming complicit through delegation is morally required (responsibility dilemmas). Mellema's Thomistic taxonomy identifies nine modes of complicity (commanding, consenting, participating, etc.) showing delegation generates different responsibility relationships. Schmitz and Bryson's AI ethics framework argues delegation to technological systems need not create responsibility gaps when accountability lines are maintained.

**Connection**: These frameworks challenge the assumption that only personal execution preserves responsibility. Delegation can maintain or even distribute responsibility through participation, shared intentions, and proper accountability structures. Whether delegation diminishes moral standing depends on the relationship established, not merely on who performs physical actions.

**Section Summary**: Relational autonomy, epistemic dependence, and shared responsibility frameworks provide systematic challenges to self-reliance valorization. Autonomy may require social embeddedness; epistemic self-reliance is often impossible or harmful; and delegation can preserve or distribute responsibility appropriately. However, defenders must address risks of paternalism and maintain distinctions between virtuous delegation and problematic abdication. **Key unresolved tension**: under what conditions does accepting help manifest autonomy versus representing heteronomy?

## Section 3: When Process Matters—Meaningful Work, Virtue Acquisition, and Character Development

**Section Purpose**: Address when and why the activity itself (not just outcomes) has moral significance, focusing on meaningful work theories, virtue-as-skill debates, and character formation through practice.

**Main Claims**:
1. Meaningful work theories identify both process goods (autonomy, skill exercise) and outcome goods (social contribution, recognition) as morally significant
2. Virtue-as-skill models suggest character development requires personal practice, but face challenges about whether virtues and skills are genuinely analogous
3. Alienation theory reveals that inability to appropriate one's productive activities represents a loss regardless of product quality

**Subsection 3.1: Meaningful Work—Process and Outcome Values**

**Papers**: Veltman 2016, Kandiyali 2020, van der Deijl 2022, Muirhead 2007, Schwartz 1982, Gheaus & Herzog 2016

**Content**: Veltman's pluralistic account identifies meaningful work as combining subjective experience, autonomy/skill exercise, social contribution, and recognition—both process and outcome matter. Kandiyali's reading of Marx emphasizes unalienated work as essentially social: it requires producing for others who appreciate one's work, not solitary self-realization. Van der Deijl distinguishes quality-meaningfulness (good for worker—autonomous, engaging) from significance-meaningfulness (good for others—valuable contribution), showing these can come apart. Muirhead prioritizes social contribution over self-realization, suggesting outcome-value exceeds process-value. Schwartz emphasizes objectification—seeing one's thought embodied in products through engaging activity—as requiring complex capacity exercise throughout production. Gheaus and Herzog's taxonomy of work goods (excellence, contribution, community, recognition, self-realization) reveals multiple dimensions that delegation may affect differently.

**Connection**: If meaningful work requires both process engagement and outcome significance, DIY's value depends on context. Personal projects lacking social contribution may preserve quality-meaningfulness while forfeiting significance-meaningfulness. Conversely, delegation may preserve contributive value while sacrificing developmental value.

**Subsection 3.2: The Virtue-as-Skill Debate**

**Papers**: Annas 2011, Stichter 2011, Schuster 2023, Kilov 2023, Krettenauer & Stichter 2023, Sanderse 2018, Vallor 2016

**Content**: Annas's influential defense of the virtue-as-skill model argues virtues develop through practice guided by understanding, analogous to musical or athletic skill acquisition. Stichter elaborates how skill-like virtues enable flexible practical wisdom through integrated practical knowledge. However, Schuster's dilemma argues ordinary skills provide a model only when assessed by agent-independent standards, threatening agent-centered virtue ethics. Kilov identifies that expert skills are "brittle"—narrow and context-bound—contradicting virtue ethics claims that virtues enable good action across contexts. Krettenauer and Stichter integrate skill development with self-regulation theory, emphasizing that practice requires internal motivation from moral identity goals. Sanderse argues Aristotelian habituation continues throughout life, not just childhood—virtue maintenance requires ongoing practice. Vallor addresses how technology reshapes practices through which virtues are cultivated.

**Connection**: If virtues are skill-like, doing things yourself is constitutive of character excellence—you cannot become virtuous by having others act virtuously for you. However, critics challenge whether virtues and skills are sufficiently analogous, and whether skill brittleness undermines the virtue-as-skill model. Even if the analogy holds, questions remain about which activities cultivate virtue and whether all tasks require personal performance.

**Subsection 3.3: Alienation and Appropriation**

**Papers**: Jaeggi 2014, Arendt 1958, Kandiyali 2020, Sayers 2005

**Content**: Jaeggi reconstructs alienation as inability to appropriate one's relations to self, others, activity, and world—a relation of relationlessness where one is involved but cannot make it one's own. Extends beyond Marx's production focus to any domain where subjects cannot identify with what they're doing. Arendt distinguishes labor (cyclical biological necessity) from work (creating durable objects that build a human world)—the latter has world-building value beyond mere consumption. Kandiyali argues unalienated production essentially involves recognition: producing for others who appreciate one's work. Sayers defends that productive labor is essential to human nature and self-realization against "end of work" perspectives—work is not merely instrumental but constitutive of human flourishing.

**Connection**: Alienation theory suggests delegation may prevent appropriation even when outcomes are good—if you cannot make the activity your own, you experience alienation. However, whether all delegation alienates or only certain forms (coerced labor, opaque processes, etc.) remains contested. The social dimension complicates things: purely personal DIY may be alienating if it lacks recognition and social contribution.

**Section Summary**: Meaningful work, virtue acquisition, and alienation perspectives emphasize when and why process matters beyond outcomes. Work's developmental goods, virtue's practice requirements, and appropriation's necessity suggest doing things yourself sometimes has distinctive value. However, not all process-value arguments succeed: skills may not model virtues well; some work-goods can be achieved through delegation; and sociality may matter more than solitary doing. **Key unresolved tension**: whether process-value inheres in all productive activity or only in specific kinds (complex, creative, social, virtue-developing).

## Section 4: Objections to the Research Proposal and Critical Tensions

**Section Purpose**: Identify objections to claims about DIY's moral value and tensions within the literature that challenge the research project's assumptions.

**Main Claims**:
1. Several philosophical traditions challenge whether doing things yourself is generally morally valuable
2. Internal tensions exist between different grounds for DIY value (autonomy vs. authenticity vs. social contribution)
3. Context-dependence may undermine systematic answers about DIY's moral value

**Subsection 4.1: Efficiency, Expertise, and When Delegation is Superior**

**Papers**: Arneson 2009, Alexander et al. 2015, Fisher & Oppenheimer 2021, Scharrer et al. 2016, Ahlstrom-Vij 2016

**Content**: Arneson's anti-perfectionist position questions whether justice requires meaningful work beyond fair welfare/opportunity distribution—if meaningful work is not required by justice, DIY becomes supererogatory rather than morally significant. Alexander et al.'s critical analysis shows division of labor benefits are conditional rather than universal—sometimes self-reliant search outperforms social learning. Fisher and Oppenheimer's empirical evidence reveals delegation creates illusions of self-sufficiency where people overestimate their competence—this suggests systematic self-assessment failures in division of labor. Scharrer et al. show science popularization creates "easiness effects" where people underrate dependence on experts after simplified explanations. Ahlstrom-Vij argues cognitive outsourcing is epistemically unproblematic when appropriately calibrated—the question is not whether to delegate but how much and to whom.

**Connection**: These efficiency and expertise arguments challenge whether DIY has general moral value rather than context-specific value. In complex domains requiring expertise, self-reliance becomes epistemically irresponsible. However, recognition of systematic biases (overconfidence after delegation, underrating dependence) complicates simple efficiency arguments.

**Subsection 4.2: Internal Tensions in DIY Defenses**

**Content**: Analyze tensions between different grounds for DIY value:
- **Autonomy vs. Authenticity**: Autonomy emphasizes reflective control over outcomes; authenticity emphasizes process of self-making through action. These can come apart—autonomous delegation of authenticity-undermining tasks is possible.
- **Individual vs. Social**: Individual autonomy/authenticity accounts emphasize personal agency; meaningful work and unalienated labor emphasize social recognition and contribution. Purely personal DIY may lack social dimension Marx and others identify as essential.
- **Process vs. Outcome**: Virtue and alienation theories emphasize process; meaningful work theories balance process and outcome; care ethics and social contribution views prioritize outcomes. No consensus on whether process has independent value.
- **Self-Reliance vs. Skill Development**: Relational autonomy challenges self-reliance as ideal; virtue-as-skill requires personal practice but not independence from others—one can develop skills through guided practice within communities.

**Connection**: These internal tensions suggest the moral value of doing things yourself may be multidimensional rather than unified. Different values (autonomy, authenticity, virtue, contribution, recognition) may point in different directions depending on context.

**Subsection 4.3: Context-Dependence and the Limits of General Claims**

**Papers**: Khader 2020, Rodriguez Apolito 2022, Celentano 2023, Corbin & Flenady 2024

**Content**: Khader argues that under oppressive conditions, relying on oneself may preserve autonomy when social support is unreliable or controlling—context determines whether self-reliance or interdependence enhances autonomy. Rodriguez Apolito warns that doing things "oneself" may reflect internalized oppression rather than genuine agency—authenticity can come apart from autonomy. Celentano's contributive justice framework shows automation should distribute meaningful work opportunities fairly—wholesale automation threatens justice even with income maintenance, but strategic automation enabling more meaningful work overall may be preferable to unequal DIY access. Corbin and Flenady's analysis of "quiet quitting" reveals that contemporary expectations that all work be meaningful can alienate workers—perhaps not all tasks need personal engagement.

**Connection**: Context—oppressive conditions, technological capabilities, work domain, stakes—may determine when doing things yourself has moral value. Attempts at general claims about DIY's moral value may fail because what matters varies by domain and circumstance. This challenges the research project's ability to provide systematic answers.

**Section Summary**: Critical perspectives reveal that DIY's moral value is contested, context-dependent, and grounded in multiple potentially conflicting values. Efficiency and expertise considerations challenge DIY in complex domains; internal tensions between autonomy, authenticity, virtue, and social contribution undermine unified accounts; and context-dependence may prevent general claims. **Key objection to research proposal**: perhaps there is no unified "moral value of doing things yourself" to theorize—only context-specific reasons why process sometimes matters beyond outcomes.

**Word Target**: 600-800 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize findings, identify unresolved tensions, and position the research project within debates about the moral value of DIY versus delegation.

**Content**:
- **Summary of key findings**: Autonomy, authenticity, and virtue considerations support DIY's process-value; relational autonomy, division of labor, and shared responsibility challenge self-reliance; meaningful work theories identify both process and outcome goods; context and domain determine when process matters
- **Unresolved tensions**:
  - **Control vs. execution**: Whether autonomous control over delegation decisions suffices for autonomy or whether personal execution is required
  - **Individual vs. social**: Whether valuable agency is fundamentally individual (autonomy/authenticity) or inherently social (recognition/contribution)
  - **Process vs. outcome**: Lack of consensus on whether activities have value independent of products, or whether all process-value reduces to outcome-value
  - **Generality vs. context**: Whether systematic claims about DIY's value are possible or whether everything depends on domain-specific features
- **Positioning the research**: The project must navigate between individualistic over-valorization of self-reliance and communitarian dissolution of personal agency. Key question is not "Is DIY always valuable?" but "When and why does doing things yourself matter morally beyond outcomes?"
- **Expected contributions**: Systematic framework distinguishing contexts where delegation is morally preferable, permissible, or problematic; integration of autonomy, virtue, and meaningful work literatures; normative guidance for automation and AI assistance design; clarification of responsibility under delegation

**Structure Rationale**: Four main sections organize by theoretical position rather than domain: (1) Arguments for DIY's value grounding it in autonomy, authenticity, and agency; (2) Challenges to self-reliance from relationality, epistemic dependence, and distributed responsibility; (3) Middle-ground accounts distinguishing when process matters via meaningful work, virtue, and alienation; (4) Objections and tensions revealing context-dependence and challenging general claims. This debate-focused structure illuminates key disagreements rather than comprehensively covering domains.

**Tone**: Analytical and focused on debates. Avoid superlatives and evaluative language not grounded in the literature's explicit arguments. Describe what authors argue rather than evaluating whose arguments are "better" or "stronger." Identify tensions and unresolved questions rather than attempting premature synthesis.

**Key Debates to Emphasize**:
1. Whether autonomy requires personal execution or just control over delegation
2. Whether self-reliance is epistemically virtuous or irresponsible in complex domains
3. Whether meaningful work/virtue requires personal practice or can be achieved through delegation
4. Whether doing things yourself is valuable generally or only in specific contexts

**Background for Writers**: The research question presupposes that doing things yourself might have moral value beyond instrumental efficiency and outcome-quality. The literature reveals this is contested: some traditions (autonomy, authenticity, virtue) support process-value; others (relational autonomy, division of labor, consequentialism) challenge it; still others (meaningful work, alienation) identify conditions under which process matters. No consensus exists on whether DIY has general moral value or only context-specific value. The synthesis should illuminate this debate structure rather than prematurely resolving it.
