## Section 4: Objections to the Research Proposal and Critical Tensions

Several philosophical traditions challenge whether doing things yourself possesses general moral value, revealing both external critiques and internal tensions within arguments supporting DIY. These objections suggest the research project may face fundamental difficulties: either DIY's value is context-dependent rather than systematic, or different grounds for DIY (autonomy, authenticity, virtue, contribution) conflict in ways that prevent unified conclusions.

### Efficiency, Expertise, and When Delegation is Superior

Arneson's (2009) anti-perfectionist position questions whether justice requires ensuring meaningful work opportunities beyond fair distribution of welfare or capability. If meaningful work represents one component of the good life among others, rather than a requirement of justice, then choices about doing things yourself versus delegating become matters of personal preference or prudence rather than moral obligation. Markets may efficiently allocate labor even when resulting work lacks meaning for some individuals, and paternalistic intervention to guarantee meaningful work is difficult to justify in liberal terms. This suggests DIY's value—if it exists—is supererogatory rather than morally significant.

The division of cognitive labor literature presents more direct challenges to self-reliance in domains requiring expertise. Alexander et al. (2015) demonstrate that benefits of division of labor are conditional on epistemic landscape features rather than universal. Their critical analysis shows that deliberate search for novel approaches need not be optimal, and one should be skeptical about benefits of social learning in epistemically complex environments. Under certain conditions, self-reliant search may outperform delegation to others. However, this nuance cuts both ways: division of labor is not always superior, but neither is self-reliance.

More troubling for DIY advocates are findings about systematic biases in self-assessment following delegation. Fisher and Oppenheimer (2021) provide empirical evidence that receiving assistance from AI or humans leads people to overestimate their own competence and underrate their dependence on experts. This "knowledge misattribution" occurs because success creates ambiguity about who deserves credit. People become poorly calibrated about their actual abilities when they rely on external help, developing illusions of self-sufficiency. Similarly, Scharrer et al. (2016) identify how science popularization creates "easiness effects": after reading simplified explanations, laypeople overestimate their epistemic capabilities and underrate their dependence on experts. These findings suggest that delegation can create false confidence about one's ability to "do it oneself," undermining accurate self-knowledge about when self-reliance is actually feasible.

The strongest critique comes from Buzzell and Rini's (2022) analysis showing that "doing your own research" represents an impossible epistemological ideal that leads to misinformation when attempted. Information overload combined with individualistic conceptions of epistemic virtue creates vulnerability to conspiracy theories. Normally we cope with informational excess through epistemic dependence on others, but attempts at epistemic self-reliance malfunction in adversarial information environments. In complex knowledge domains, attempting DIY is not merely inefficient but epistemically irresponsible. Ahlstrom-Vij (2016) reaches a moderate conclusion: cognitive outsourcing is epistemically unproblematic when appropriately calibrated. The question is not whether to delegate but how much and to whom.

These efficiency and expertise arguments suggest that in domains requiring specialized knowledge or skills, self-reliance becomes epistemically inferior to appropriate delegation. DIY may have value in simple or familiar domains while delegation is preferable—perhaps morally required—where expertise matters.

### Internal Tensions in DIY Defenses

Even accepting that doing things yourself sometimes has value, different philosophical grounds for this value point in conflicting directions. Autonomy-based arguments emphasize reflective control over whether outcomes align with one's endorsed values. Garnett (2023) argues that systematic practical deference constitutes interpersonal rule, but this leaves open whether autonomous delegation of specific tasks undermines self-determination or manifests it. Authenticity-based arguments, by contrast, emphasize the process of self-making through action (Bauer 2021). These grounds can come apart: one might autonomously delegate tasks in ways that forfeit opportunities for authentic self-authorship.

The tension between individual and social dimensions runs deeper. Taylor's (1992) authenticity requires engagement with horizons of significance that are inter-subjective rather than purely personal. Kandiyali (2020) argues that for Marx, unalienated production essentially involves producing for others who appreciate one's work—purely solitary DIY may fail to realize work's full value because it lacks the social dimension of mutual recognition. Yet autonomy and authenticity theories typically emphasize individual agency and self-direction. If meaningful productive activity requires social contribution and recognition, then personal DIY projects serving only oneself may preserve autonomy and authenticity while forfeiting significance-meaningfulness (van der Deijl 2022).

The process-versus-outcome tension pervades the literature without resolution. Schwartz (1982) emphasizes objectification: seeing one's thought embodied in products through engaging complex activity throughout production. This strongly supports process-value—delegation prevents achieving this meaning even if products are identical. However, Muirhead (2007) prioritizes social contribution over self-realization, suggesting work's value comes primarily from serving others rather than developing oneself. These perspectives conflict about whether DIY's value inheres in the activity itself or depends on outcomes including social contribution.

Finally, virtue-as-skill arguments require personal practice for character development (Annas 2011), but this seems to support self-reliance. Yet relational autonomy theorists (Westlund 2009, Held 2006) argue that autonomy requires rather than excludes supportive relationships and interdependence. One can develop skills through guided practice within communities rather than in isolation. The tension is whether developing capacities requires doing things oneself (which could be done within supportive relationships) or whether accepting help and mutual aid better manifests virtue than struggling alone.

These internal tensions suggest that "the moral value of doing things yourself" may not name a unified phenomenon. Different values—autonomy, authenticity, virtue development, social contribution, recognition—may point in different directions depending on context.

### Context-Dependence and the Limits of General Claims

Several arguments suggest that systematic answers about DIY's moral value may be impossible because what matters varies fundamentally by context. Khader's (2020) internal feminist critique of relational autonomy reveals that under oppressive conditions, relying on oneself may preserve autonomy when social support is unreliable or controlling. Context determines whether self-reliance or interdependence enhances autonomy—there is no general answer. Conversely, in supportive communities, accepting help may manifest autonomy better than insisting on self-sufficiency. Whether doing things yourself is valuable depends on the social conditions surrounding the activity.

Rodriguez Apolito's (2022) warning that authenticity requirements can obscure oppression applies directly to DIY. Doing things "oneself" may reflect internalized oppressive conditioning rather than genuine self-direction. A woman's "choice" to perform all domestic labor herself may express socialized gender norms rather than authentic agency. Authenticity can come apart from autonomy, and both can come apart from genuinely valuable activity. This suggests DIY cannot be assessed acontextually—we must ask whether the preference for doing things oneself reflects genuine values or adaptive preferences formed under constraint.

Celentano's (2023) contributive justice framework shows that automation's impact on meaningful work depends on how it is designed and distributed. Wholesale automation eliminating meaningful work opportunities threatens justice even with income maintenance. However, strategic automation that frees people for more meaningful work overall may be preferable to unequal access to engaging tasks. The moral question is not "automation versus DIY" in general, but how technological capabilities should be deployed to distribute meaningful work fairly. Similarly, the choice between doing things yourself and delegating to others cannot be assessed without understanding the alternatives available and their distributive implications.

Corbin and Flenady's (2024) analysis of "quiet quitting" reveals that contemporary expectations that all work be meaningful can alienate workers when these expectations exceed what work actually provides. Perhaps not all productive tasks need personal engagement or identity-constitution. If attempting to find meaning in every activity sets impossible standards, then strategic limitation of where one invests effort (including selective delegation) may be more realistic than demanding that all tasks be done meaningfully oneself.

These context-dependence arguments challenge the research project's ability to provide systematic answers about DIY's moral value. If what matters depends on social conditions (oppressive versus supportive), domain features (simple versus complex, personal versus social), technological possibilities (automation enabling versus eliminating meaningful work), and individual circumstances (one's relationship to specific activities), then perhaps there is no unified "moral value of doing things yourself" to theorize. Instead, there may be only context-specific reasons why process sometimes matters beyond outcomes, why autonomy sometimes requires self-reliance and sometimes requires accepting help, and why authenticity may or may not align with doing things oneself.

The fundamental objection to the research proposal is that it seeks systematic answers to questions that may have only particularistic answers. The moral value of doing things yourself may be irreducibly context-dependent, varying by domain, social conditions, individual capacities, and available alternatives in ways that resist general theorizing.
