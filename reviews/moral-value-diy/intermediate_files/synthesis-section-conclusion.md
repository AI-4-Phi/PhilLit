## Conclusion

This literature review has revealed that the moral value of doing things yourself is deeply contested across multiple philosophical traditions. Rather than converging on a unified answer, the literature exposes fundamental tensions between competing values and frameworks, raising questions about whether systematic claims about DIY's moral significance are even possible.

The case for DIY's distinctive moral value rests on three main pillars. First, autonomy and authenticity considerations suggest that doing things yourself preserves essential connections between reflective will and action execution. Frankfurt (1971) established that autonomous action requires alignment between higher-order endorsement and effective desires, while Garnett (2023) argues that systematic practical deference constitutes a form of interpersonal rule that compromises self-authorship. Mogensen (2015) reveals that resistance to moral testimony stems from authenticity ideals—we value forming beliefs ourselves because authentic agency requires that commitments originate in us. Second, virtue-as-skill theories suggest that character development requires personal practice. Annas (2011) argues that virtues develop through repeated practice guided by understanding, just as skills do, while Krettenauer and Stichter (2023) show how self-motivated practice is necessary for virtue acquisition. Third, alienation and meaningful work theories emphasize process goods: Jaeggi (2014) characterizes alienation as inability to appropriate one's activities, while Veltman (2016) identifies autonomy and skill exercise as intrinsic work goods beyond social contribution.

However, these arguments face substantial challenges. Relational autonomy theories fundamentally question self-reliance as an ideal. Mackenzie and Stoljar (2000) established that autonomy may be constituted through rather than despite social relationships, while Westlund (2009) argues that autonomy requires dialogical accountability to others rather than independence. Khader (2020) warns that under oppressive conditions, self-reliance may preserve autonomy when social support is unreliable—but Humphries (2025) defends that recognizing genuine constraints on autonomy is realistic rather than paternalistic. Division of cognitive labor arguments demonstrate that epistemic self-reliance is often impossible and irresponsible. Kitcher (1990) showed that scientific progress depends on specialization, while Buzzell and Rini (2022) reveal that "doing your own research" leads to misinformation when cognitive limitations meet information overload. Carter (2017) argues that intellectual autonomy requires appropriate delegation while maintaining self-direction, not cognitive isolation.

Critically, the virtue-as-skill model faces mounting empirical and conceptual challenges. Schuster (2023) argues that skills provide plausible models of practical reason only when assessed by agent-independent standards, threatening agent-centered virtue ethics. Kilov (2023) identifies expert skill "brittleness"—skills are narrow and context-bound, contradicting virtue ethics' claim that virtues enable good action across contexts. These critiques suggest that even if practicing skills yourself develops competencies, it may not build the robust moral character virtue ethicists envision.

Four unresolved tensions structure the literature. First, the **control-versus-execution tension**: whether autonomous control over delegation decisions suffices for autonomy (Bratman 2014) or whether personal execution is required to preserve the connection between reflective will and action (Frankfurt 1971, Garnett 2023). Second, the **individual-versus-social tension**: whether valuable agency is fundamentally individualistic (autonomy and authenticity frameworks) or inherently social (Kandiyali 2020's reading of Marx emphasizing recognition and contribution; Held 2006's care ethics emphasizing interdependence). Third, the **process-versus-outcome tension**: whether activities have value independent of products (Jaeggi 2014, Turner 2022 on intellectual perseverance) or whether process-value ultimately reduces to outcome-value (Muirhead 2007 prioritizing social contribution; van der Deijl 2022 distinguishing quality from significance). Fourth, the **generality-versus-context tension**: whether systematic claims about DIY's moral value are possible (Annas 2011's general virtue-as-skill model) or whether everything depends on domain-specific features (Khader 2020 on oppressive conditions; Alexander et al. 2015 showing division of labor benefits are conditional; Celentano 2023 on automation context).

Extended mind theory initially appeared to dissolve DIY questions by showing tools extend rather than replace the self (Clark and Chalmers 1998). However, Wheeler (2018) identifies how smart technologies with autonomous AI resist the transparency traditional tools provide, while Carter (2018) argues excessive cognitive offloading threatens intellectual autonomy by undermining freedom to achieve independently. Britten-Neish (2025) defends cognitive offloading as genuine action when embedded in appropriate teleological structures, yet the moral significance of tool integration versus human delegation remains contested.

The complicity and shared responsibility literatures complicate simple contrasts between personal execution and delegation. Kutz (2000) argues individuals bear responsibility for harms they participate in regardless of causal contribution, while Bratman (1992, 2014) shows delegation can involve interlocking intentions constituting genuine shared agency rather than mere causal manipulation. Whether delegation diminishes moral standing depends on the relationship established, not merely on who performs physical actions. Yet Mellema (2016) identifies nine distinct modes of complicity that generate different responsibility relationships, suggesting the moral evaluation of delegation depends on how it is structured.

Meaningful work theories reveal that not all process-value arguments succeed. Van der Deijl (2022) distinguishes quality-meaningfulness (good for worker—autonomous, engaging) from significance-meaningfulness (good for others—valuable contribution), showing these can come apart. Personal DIY projects may preserve quality while forfeiting significance; conversely, delegation may preserve contributive value while sacrificing developmental value. Kandiyali (2020) argues unalienated production essentially involves producing for others who appreciate one's work, suggesting purely solitary DIY may fail to realize work's full value. Corbin and Flenady (2024) reveal that contemporary expectations that all work be meaningful can alienate workers—perhaps not all tasks require personal engagement.

The research project must navigate between individualistic over-valorization of self-reliance and communitarian dissolution of personal agency. The literature reveals that "Is DIY always valuable?" is the wrong question. The productive question is: "When and why does doing things yourself matter morally beyond outcomes?" The answer appears to be multidimensional rather than unified. Different values—autonomy, authenticity, virtue, social contribution, recognition—may point in different directions depending on context. Doing things yourself may preserve autonomy in oppressive conditions where social support is unreliable (Khader 2020), yet undermine autonomy in complex epistemic domains where expert reliance is necessary (Buzzell and Rini 2022, Nguyen 2018). Personal execution may be constitutive of virtue development through skill practice (Annas 2011), yet skills' brittleness and narrow applicability (Kilov 2023) question whether this builds robust character. DIY activities may enable appropriation and prevent alienation (Jaeggi 2014), yet forfeit the social recognition and contribution that Marx identifies as essential to unalienated labor (Kandiyali 2020).

Expected contributions of the research project include: a systematic framework distinguishing contexts where delegation is morally preferable, permissible, or problematic; integration of autonomy, virtue, and meaningful work literatures that typically proceed independently; normative guidance for automation and AI assistance design that preserves valuable forms of human agency while enabling appropriate delegation; and clarification of how responsibility is distributed or maintained under various forms of delegation. Rather than defending or rejecting DIY's general moral value, the project should map the multidimensional evaluative space in which choices about self-performance versus delegation are made, identifying which values are at stake in different contexts and how they trade off against each other when they conflict.

The literature reveals no consensus on whether doing things yourself has general moral value or only context-specific value. This may not represent a failure of philosophical theorizing but rather reflect genuine complexity in the phenomena. The moral value of personal execution versus delegation may depend irreducibly on: the type of activity (cognitive, physical, affective); the social context (oppressive, supportive, egalitarian); the relationships involved (care, employment, exchange); the goods at stake (autonomy, virtue, contribution, recognition); and the agent's capacities and vulnerabilities. Philosophical progress may require abandoning the search for unified general principles in favor of domain-specific frameworks that respect this complexity.
