## Section 1: The Case for Doing It Yourself—Autonomy, Authenticity, and Agency

Philosophical defenses of doing things yourself typically ground such value in ideals of autonomous agency, authentic self-authorship, and genuine control over one's life. These traditions suggest that the process of action—not merely the outcomes achieved—has distinctive moral significance when the agent herself performs the task rather than delegating it to others or to technological systems.

### Autonomy and Self-Determination

Harry Frankfurt's hierarchical model of autonomy provides the canonical starting point for understanding why personal execution might matter morally (Frankfurt 1971). Frankfurt argues that autonomous action requires alignment between an agent's first-order desires and second-order volitions—the agent must have the will she wants to have. On this view, autonomy consists in the proper functioning of reflective self-evaluation rather than the presence of alternative possibilities. For DIY ethics, the question becomes whether delegation severs the connection Frankfurt identifies as essential: does having another person execute an action compromise the hierarchical structure linking reflective endorsement to effective action, even when outcomes align with one's second-order volitions?

Recent work extends this question by examining delegation specifically. Michael Garnett argues that systematic practical deference—deferring to another's practical judgment about how to conduct one's life—constitutes a distinctive form of interpersonal rule (Garnett 2023). When an agent habitually defers to another's judgment, they establish a social relationship where the other person partially governs their life. Crucially, this undermines autonomy not by compromising authenticity or reason-tracking, but by constituting heteronomy—rule by another. Garnett's analysis suggests that delegation of practical judgment (not merely execution) represents a loss of autonomous self-authorship even when the deferring agent reflectively endorses the arrangement. However, whether hiring someone to perform a task involves the problematic practical deference Garnett identifies, or whether one can maintain autonomous control over life plans while delegating execution, remains contested.

Suzy Killmister's multidimensional theory provides conceptual tools for analyzing how delegation might affect different dimensions of autonomy independently (Killmister 2017). She distinguishes four components: self-definition (identifying with certain values), self-realization (acting on those values), self-unification (coherence across time), and self-constitution (developing autonomous capacities). This framework suggests that delegation might compromise self-realization—acting on one's values through one's own efforts—without necessarily affecting self-definition or self-unification. Perhaps delegating preserves autonomy along some dimensions while diminishing it along others, avoiding simple verdicts about whether delegation per se is autonomy-undermining.

Michael Bratman's planning theory adds temporal depth to hierarchical accounts by emphasizing how autonomous agents maintain coherent systems of plans and policies over time (Bratman 2003). Autonomous action emerges from the functioning of this planning system rather than mere reflective endorsement at a moment. This suggests that autonomous agents might need higher-order policies about which domains they will govern directly versus delegate—DIY activities might be those falling under policies of direct personal governance. Whether such policies themselves emerge from autonomous planning or whether autonomy requires direct engagement in certain domains regardless of planning remains an open question.

Andrea Westlund's dialogical account further complicates matters by arguing that autonomy requires holding oneself answerable to external critical perspectives (Westlund 2009). Autonomy is constitutively relational on this view—it requires preparedness to answer for one's commitments to others. This raises the possibility that completely independent action might be less autonomous than action coordinated with or accountable to others. If autonomy is inherently dialogical, then delegation might preserve or even enhance autonomy when it involves appropriate responsiveness to others' perspectives, while pure self-reliance might represent a failure of dialogical accountability.

### Authenticity and Self-Authorship

Charles Taylor's reconstruction of authenticity as requiring self-transcendence through engagement with horizons of significance provides philosophical grounding for process-based value (Taylor 1992). Against critics who dismiss authenticity as narcissistic self-indulgence, Taylor argues that genuine authenticity requires not just self-expression but connection to values and meanings that transcend individual preference. Authentic self-realization emerges through dialogical engagement with others and critical appropriation of shared cultural frameworks. For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things yourself has value when activities connect to inter-subjective meanings—not every self-directed action is authentically valuable, only those expressing engagement with genuine horizons of significance.

Jack Bauer's distinction between essentialist and existentialist authenticity clarifies which conception grounds DIY value (Bauer 2021). Essentialist authenticity treats the true self as discovered inborn traits or an essential nature—being authentic means matching actions to this pre-existing self. Existentialist authenticity, by contrast, emphasizes self-making through values-driven action—the true self is not discovered but created through choices and commitments. Only existentialist accounts clearly support the intrinsic value of doing things yourself: self-authorship occurs through the process of doing, not merely through achieving outcomes that match a pre-existing nature. Bauer's emphasis on "poiesis"—humane self-making processes—suggests that process has independent value beyond the matching principle. One authors oneself through engaged activity rather than passive self-discovery.

Andreas Mogensen's analysis of moral testimony reveals how authenticity ideals implicitly ground resistance to deference (Mogensen 2015). When philosophers argue that one should form moral beliefs oneself rather than accepting them on testimony, they invoke authenticity: moral beliefs must originate in oneself to have proper authority or meaning. The process of forming beliefs matters beyond the outcome of having true beliefs. This provides a model for extending DIY intuitions from epistemic to practical domains: perhaps we value doing things ourselves because we implicitly value authenticity in action, not just in belief. The activity must be our own to constitute genuine self-authorship.

However, Maite Rodríguez Apólito's critique warns that authenticity requirements can obscure oppression (Rodríguez Apólito 2022). She argues that procedural autonomy theories relying on authenticity conditions fail to detect heteronomy arising from social oppression. Oppression often produces preferences that feel authentic—coherent with other attitudes, reflectively endorsed—but actually reflect internalized oppressive norms. For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things "oneself" may not track genuine agency if one's sense of what to do oneself reflects oppressive social conditioning. Authenticity (matching actions to felt preferences) can come apart from autonomy (genuine self-direction). The feminist critique challenges simple appeals to authenticity as grounding DIY value, requiring attention to whether preferences for self-reliance or delegation themselves emerge from oppressive conditions.

Charles Guignon's work emphasizes that authenticity, properly understood, is simultaneously a personal and social virtue requiring commitment to sustaining democratic communities (Guignon 2004). Authentic individuals must be able to achieve clear self-awareness about their commitments and express them publicly—this capacity for lucid self-understanding and public expression is precisely what democratic citizenship requires. The emphasis on authenticity as public self-expression rather than mere private self-feeling suggests that doing things yourself matters partly as a mode of engaging with social life. The value isn't purely internal but connects to being an effective participant in shared institutions and practices.

### Technology, Tools, and Extended Agency

The extended mind thesis radically challenges whether using tools constitutes "doing it yourself" or delegating to external systems. Andy Clark and David Chalmers argue that cognitive processes can literally extend beyond brain and skull to include environmental resources when they are reliably available, functionally integrated, and automatically endorsed (Clark and Chalmers 1998). Otto's notebook doesn't merely support his memory—it constitutes part of his cognitive system. If this is correct, tool use doesn't outsource tasks to something external but reconfigures the boundaries of the cognitive agent. The parity principle suggests that if an external process plays the same functional role as an internal one, it is genuinely cognitive. This threatens to dissolve the DIY question: using properly integrated tools is doing it yourself in extended form.

George Britten-Neish develops an Anscombean action-theoretic defense of cognitive offloading as genuine agency (Britten-Neish 2025). He argues that opposition to extended cognition stems partly from unarticulated intuitions rooted in Davidson's interface model, where intentions cause bodily movements at a boundary. An Anscombean model recognizes that actions express intentions only within appropriate teleologically structured contexts—agency depends generally on bodily and environmental settings. On this view, offloading is paradigmatically intentional action when embedded in proper teleological structures. One acts through one's tools rather than being assisted by them. This challenges the assumption that keeping processes internal is necessary for genuine agency.

However, critics argue that contemporary smart technologies resist the integration extended mind theory requires. Michael Wheeler identifies how AI-based applications challenge transparency—the phenomenological disappearance of tools in expert use (Wheeler 2018). Traditional tools become transparent in skilled practice: the hammer disappears from conscious experience as one focuses on driving the nail. But smart technologies with autonomous behavior resist this transparency—they "reappear" in conscious experience because their operations require monitoring. This suggests that AI-assisted action differs phenomenologically from traditional tool use, potentially marking a morally relevant boundary. If smart technologies resist integration in ways simple tools do not, then using AI may involve delegation to an external agent rather than extension of the self.

J. Adam Carter argues that excessive cognitive offloading threatens intellectual autonomy by undermining the freedom to achieve intellectual goals independently (Carter 2018). While offloading enhances efficiency, overdependence erodes the capacity for autonomous achievement. The "freedom to achieve" matters beyond the outcomes achieved—maintaining the capacity for independent accomplishment has independent value. This challenges pure consequentialist defenses of technological delegation: even when outcomes are equivalent, loss of autonomous capacities represents genuine harm. Educational practices should cultivate balanced offloading that preserves rather than maximizes cognitive delegation.

Cody Turner identifies intellectual perseverance—the virtue of mentally persisting through challenges—as specifically threatened by cognitive offloading (Turner 2022). Brain-computer interfaces enabling effortless offloading remove the cognitive challenges that cultivate perseverance. While Turner acknowledges that responsible offloading might reallocate perseverance to more valuable intellectual pursuits, excessive delegation undermines virtue development. The process of struggling through cognitive tasks has independent value as the practice through which intellectual virtues develop. This suggests doing things yourself matters not just for outcomes but for the character development that effortful engagement enables.

The extended mind framework initially appears to dissolve DIY questions by showing tools extend rather than replace agency. However, criticisms emphasizing autonomy loss, virtue erosion, and the distinctive character of opaque smart technologies suggest that boundaries between self and external resources matter morally even when metaphysically indeterminate. Whether what matters is who performs the action (you versus others or machines) or whether the outcome reflects your will through properly integrated systems remains a central unresolved tension. The technology cases reveal that debates about doing things yourself cannot ignore questions about the nature of tool use and cognitive offloading—these are not peripheral but central to understanding when and why personal execution matters.

**Section complete**: This section establishes three strands of argument supporting DIY's moral value: hierarchical autonomy theories suggesting delegation severs connections between reflective will and action; existentialist authenticity theories identifying self-authorship as occurring through engaged doing; and extended mind debates revealing tensions between tool integration and autonomous capacity preservation. However, all three strands face challenges: delegation with proper control may preserve autonomy, authenticity ideals can reflect oppression, and tool integration complicates agency boundaries. The key unresolved question is whether what matters morally is the identity of the actor or the proper expression of the agent's will through action.
