## The Case Against Self-Reliance—Relationality, Division of Labor, and Expertise

### Relational Autonomy and the Critique of Self-Sufficiency

The relational autonomy tradition provides systematic philosophical grounds for questioning whether self-reliance manifests autonomy. Mackenzie and Stoljar (2000) established that autonomy is compatible with—and may even require—social relationships and embeddedness rather than independence. This foundational collection distinguished causally relational accounts, where relationships support autonomy development, from constitutively relational accounts, where social conditions partly define what autonomy is. Nedelsky (1989) argued that traditional liberal autonomy grounded in property-based boundaries emphasizes separation from others, but genuine self-determination requires particular kinds of relationships that enable rather than constrain agency. The focus should shift from boundaries separating mine from yours to relationships enabling self-determination.

Westlund (2009) developed a constitutively relational account that avoids perfectionism by requiring only a formal interpersonal condition: autonomy requires holding oneself answerable to external critical perspectives. This dialogical disposition is not a substantive constraint on values but a formal requirement of openness to others' criticism. Pure self-reliance without responsiveness to others may undermine rather than manifest autonomy. Friedman (2003) defended procedural relational autonomy that acknowledges social embeddedness while preserving reflective endorsement requirements, showing how accepting help and offering care can be autonomous when reflectively endorsed.

However, Khader (2020) raised a powerful internal critique: socially constitutive conceptions make idealized social conditions necessary for autonomy, which creates problems under nonideal conditions. Such accounts risk asking oppressed agents to engage in self-harm to maintain autonomy, and they risk making oppressed agents appropriate objects of paternalism. If autonomy requires supportive social conditions that oppressed people lack, the account may deny their agency precisely when they rely on themselves to navigate oppressive environments. Humphries (2025) defended against this charge, arguing that recognizing genuine constraints on autonomy is realistic rather than paternalistic—we genuinely do lack autonomy in oppressive social conditions, and the theory correctly identifies this as a problem with the world rather than with individuals.

Care ethics extends these relational insights by treating interdependence as morally fundamental rather than threatening. Held (2006) argued that caring relationships should be understood as basic rather than derivable from justice or rights, directly challenging the atomistic individualism of mainstream moral theory. Boldt (2019) synthesized care and autonomy perspectives, arguing they are interdependent rather than opposed: autonomous will-formation depends on well-being and social embeddedness, while care must respect autonomy. The dichotomy between independence and dependence represents a false choice.

If autonomy is constituted through rather than despite social relationships, self-reliance may not enhance autonomy as individualistic accounts suggest. Accepting help and mutual aid may manifest autonomy when it reflects appropriate trust and recognition of interdependence. However, the internal debate between Khader and Humphries reveals tensions: under oppressive conditions, does relying on oneself preserve autonomy against unreliable or controlling social support, or does it reflect false consciousness about genuine constraints? This unresolved tension complicates claims about when accepting help manifests autonomy versus representing heteronomy.

### The Impossibility and Irresponsibility of Epistemic Self-Reliance

Division of cognitive labor arguments demonstrate that epistemic self-reliance is often impossible and epistemically inferior to appropriate expert reliance. Kitcher (1990) provided the foundational case: scientific communities achieve epistemic progress more effectively when scientists divide labor by pursuing different research approaches, even when some appear initially less promising. Social dependence enhances epistemic achievement through beneficial diversity that self-reliant inquiry cannot replicate. However, Alexander, Himmelreich, and Thompson (2015) offered critical refinement, showing that benefits of division of labor are conditional on epistemic landscape features rather than universal. Sometimes self-reliant search outperforms social learning, depending on the structure of the problem space.

Buzzell and Rini (2022) argued that "doing your own research" represents an impossible epistemological ideal that leads to misinformation when attempted. Information overload combined with implausibly individualistic conceptions of epistemic virtue create vulnerability to conspiracy theories. Normally we cope with informational excess through epistemic dependence on others, but "superheroic" attempts at self-reliance malfunction in adversarial information environments. Keren (2018) argued that given division of cognitive labor, scientific education should cultivate "competent outsiders" who can evaluate and trust expertise rather than attempting self-reliant mastery of expert content. Nguyen (2018) identified how hyper-specialization creates "cognitive islands" where even experts cannot evaluate cross-field arguments, making epistemic dependence necessary but challenging.

Carter (2017) provided a moderate framework: intellectual autonomy does not require cognitive isolation or self-reliance but rather appropriate reliance and epistemic outsourcing while maintaining intellectual self-direction. The question is not whether to delegate but how much and to whom, preserving self-direction while recognizing dependence. Ahlstrom-Vij (2016) similarly argued that cognitive outsourcing is epistemically unproblematic when appropriately calibrated—the issue is calibrated trust, not avoidance of dependence.

Empirical work reveals systematic biases in division of cognitive labor. Fisher and Oppenheimer (2021) showed that receiving assistance from others leads people to overestimate their own competence and underrate their dependence on experts—delegation creates illusions of self-sufficiency. Scharrer et al. (2016) demonstrated that science popularization creates "easiness effects" where simplified information leads laypeople to overestimate their epistemic capabilities and underestimate dependence on experts. These findings suggest that self-assessment failures may lead people to inappropriate self-reliance when delegation would be epistemically superior.

In complex knowledge domains, attempting self-reliance represents epistemically irresponsible overconfidence rather than intellectual virtue. "Doing it yourself" epistemically means cultivating competent reliance on experts, not attempting independent mastery. This fundamentally challenges whether DIY approaches represent virtue or vice in epistemic contexts. However, the conditional nature of division of labor benefits and the systematic miscalibration problems suggest the challenge is identifying when to delegate and to whom, not simply always deferring to others.

### Shared Agency and Distributed Responsibility

Complicity and shared agency frameworks challenge the assumption that only personal execution preserves responsibility. Kutz (2000) argued for a "Complicity Principle" under which individuals are accountable for harms they participate in, even when their individual contribution makes no difference to the outcome. Participation in collective endeavors generates responsibility based on shared intentionality, not individual causal contribution. This suggests delegation may not absolve responsibility—one remains complicit in outcomes through the delegation decision itself.

Bratman's planning theory of shared agency (1992, 2014) shows delegation can involve interlocking intentions constituting genuine shared action rather than mere causal manipulation. When principals delegate to agents within frameworks of interlocking intentions and shared policies, outcomes may still reflect the principal's agency though distributed through relationships. This accommodates hierarchical shared agency including delegation while preserving individual rational agency. Delegation preserves agency and responsibility when structured through appropriate shared intentions.

Jensen (2018) examined cases where becoming complicit through delegation is morally required—responsibility dilemmas where refusing to participate allows greater harm. This nuances the complicity literature: sometimes delegating or accepting delegation represents the lesser evil, showing moral evaluation cannot be determined solely by responsibility distribution but depends on comparative outcomes. Mellema (2016) provided a taxonomy of complicity modes drawing on Aquinas: commanding, counseling, consenting, provoking, praising, concealing, participating, silence, and defending. Delegation involves multiple forms simultaneously (commanding, consenting, participating), generating different responsibility relationships depending on how delegation is structured.

Recent work on AI ethics addresses responsibility when tasks are delegated to technological systems. Schmitz and Bryson (2025) argued against the notion that AI systems create inevitable "ethics sinks" where responsibility dissipates. They proposed a framework requiring: maintaining clear human accountability lines, ensuring humans can verify AI system functioning, and introducing AI only where it enhances transparency. Technological delegation need not create responsibility gaps when accountability is preserved. However, Boland (2025) and Xia (2025) explored whether increasingly autonomous AI systems develop genuine agency requiring distributed responsibility frameworks treating both humans and AI as bearing responsibility based on their contributions.

These frameworks suggest delegation can maintain or appropriately distribute responsibility through participation, shared intentions, and proper accountability structures. Whether delegation diminishes moral standing depends on the relationship established and the accountability mechanisms maintained, not merely on who performs physical actions. However, defenders must address when delegation represents virtuous participation in shared agency versus problematic abdication of responsibility. The key question becomes: under what conditions does delegation preserve appropriate responsibility versus creating morally problematic distance from outcomes?
