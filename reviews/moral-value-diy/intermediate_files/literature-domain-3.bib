DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines theories of moral responsibility, control, and agency,
particularly as they relate to delegation and collaborative action. The literature
divides into several key debates: (1) The control condition debate, centered on
Fischer and Ravizza's guidance control versus regulative control requiring alternative
possibilities; (2) The reactive attitudes tradition following Strawson's seminal
paper, examining when blame and praise are appropriate; (3) Complicity and shared
responsibility, investigating how individuals bear responsibility for collective
outcomes; and (4) Recent applications to AI and technology, exploring responsibility
gaps when autonomous systems mediate action. Christopher Kutz's work on complicity
without causal contribution is particularly relevant to delegation, as is Bratman's
account of shared agency through interlocking intentions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The moral value of doing things yourself depends critically on whether delegating
tasks diminishes responsibility or merely distributes it. Fischer and Ravizza's
guidance control framework suggests responsibility tracks one's reasons-responsive
mechanism, not direct causal contribution. Kutz's complicity principle argues
participants share responsibility even when individual contributions are causally
inert. These debates directly address whether delegation compromises moral standing.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While extensive literature exists on collective responsibility and shared agency,
few papers directly examine the ethical significance of *choosing* to delegate
versus performing tasks oneself. The intrinsic value (not just instrumental
efficiency) of personal action remains under-explored. Recent AI ethics work
addresses responsibility gaps but focuses on accountability rather than the
moral significance of retaining agency. Jensen and Mellema are both missing abstracts.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Distinguish between: (1) causal responsibility (making a difference), (2) moral
responsibility (eligibility for praise/blame), and (3) what we might call
"authorship" (the value of an outcome tracking to one's own agency). The DIY
project may concern the third category more than the first two.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Control-based theories: 6 papers - Responsibility requires appropriate control (guidance vs. regulative)
- Complicity theories: 4 papers - Participation generates responsibility independent of causal contribution
- Shared agency theories: 4 papers - Joint action through interlocking intentions and plural subjects
- Applied AI ethics: 4 papers - Responsibility gaps and distributed responsibility in technological systems

  CORE ARGUMENT: Frankfurt challenges the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP), arguing that moral responsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise. Through counterexamples where agents lack alternative possibilities yet remain responsible, Frankfurt demonstrates that control over one's actual choice-making process, not access to alternatives, grounds responsibility.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to delegation: if one can be responsible without alternatives, then delegating may not diminish responsibility even when it restricts one's options. However, this focuses on whether alternatives matter for responsibility attribution, not whether choosing to retain or relinquish control has intrinsic moral significance.

  POSITION: Compatibilist; denies PAP; foundational for guidance control theories.

  abstract = {A dominant role in nearly all recent inquiries into the free-will problem has been played by a principle which the author shall call ‘the principle of alternate possibilities.’ This principle states that a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise. Its exact meaning is a subject of controversy, particularly concerning whether someone who accepts it is thereby committed to believing that moral responsibility and determinism are incompatible. In seeking illustrations of the principle of alternate possibilities, it is most natural to think of situations in which the same circumstances both bring it about that a person does something and make it impossible for him to avoid doing it. The two main concepts employed in the principle of alternate possibilities are ‘morally responsible’ and ‘could have done otherwise.’ To discuss the principle without analyzing either of these concepts may well seem like an attempt at piracy.},
  sep_context = {SEP entry "Moral Responsibility and the Principle of Alternative Possibilities" discusses Frankfurt (1969) as introducing "Frankfurt-Style Cases" (FSCs) to challenge PAP. The entry notes: "A more well-known FSC comes in an earlier paper (Frankfurt 1969; Frankfurt credits Robert Nozick's unpublished lectures for similar examples)." These cases show agents who "seem morally responsible for deciding to take the drug and for taking it. Yet both decision and action were inevitable." The SEP characterizes Frankfurt's contribution as demonstrating that "unlike some of the earlier attempts to undermine PAP, there is no factor, internal to the agent or otherwise, compelling the action."},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Watson develops a hierarchical model of agency distinguishing between an agent's valuational system (what they care about) and motivational system (what moves them to act). Free agency requires that action flow from one's values, not merely desires. An agent acts freely when their motivational system aligns with their valuational system.

  RELEVANCE: Provides resources for distinguishing mere causal contribution from genuine authorship. When one delegates, the question becomes whether the outcome reflects one's valuational system or merely one's instrumental choices. This bears on whether delegated achievements carry the same moral weight as personally performed ones.

@book{kutz2000complicity,

  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9780511663758},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kutz argues for a "Complicity Principle" under which individuals are accountable for harms they participate in, even when their individual contribution makes no difference to the outcome. He rejects the "difference principle" that ties responsibility to causal efficacy, proposing instead that participation in collective endeavors generates responsibility based on shared intentionality, not individual causal contribution.

  RELEVANCE: Central to the delegation question. If Kutz is right that participation matters more than causal difference-making, then delegating tasks to others may not absolve one of responsibility—one remains complicit in the outcome. However, this raises the reverse question: does retaining tasks rather than delegating also constitute a morally significant choice about participation?

  POSITION: Participation-based responsibility; challenges individualism about moral responsibility.

Our relations as individuals to these collective harms constitute the domain of complicity. This book examines the relationship between collective responsibility and individual guilt. It presents a rigorous philosophical account of the nature of our relations to the social groups in which we participate, and uses that account in a discussion of contemporary moral theory. Christopher Kutz shows that the two prevailing theories of moral philosophy, Kantianism and consequentialism, both have difficulties resolving problems of complicity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Jensen examines cases where agents face a dilemma: they can either participate in a collective harm (becoming complicit) or refuse participation and allow greater harm to occur. He argues that in some cases, becoming complicit is morally required, challenging the view that complicity always generates blameworthiness.

  RELEVANCE: Nuances the complicity literature for delegation contexts. Sometimes delegating (making others complicit) or accepting delegation (becoming complicit oneself) may be the lesser evil. This suggests the moral evaluation of delegation cannot be determined solely by responsibility distribution, but depends on comparative outcomes.

@book{mellema2016complicity,

  title = {Complicity and Moral Accountability},
  year = {2016},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvpj78ss},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Aquinas's taxonomy of "accessory sins," Mellema analyzes nine ways of becoming complicit in another's wrongdoing: commanding, counseling, consenting, provoking, praising, concealing, participating, silence, and defending. He argues that performing any contributory action to another's wrong makes one morally blameworthy, though the degree of blameworthiness varies by the mode of contribution.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a fine-grained analysis of how delegation (commanding others, consenting to their actions) generates different forms of complicity. Relevant to distinguishing between delegating tasks to willing collaborators versus coercing or manipulating others into performing tasks on one's behalf.

  POSITION: Taxonomy-based approach to complicity; moderate view on blame.

  keywords = {complicity, moral-accountability, taxonomy, Medium},
  abstract = {Gregory Mellema’s short and lively book on the ethics of complicity, while decidedly a work of analytical philosophy, is ‘aimed at an audience that includes nonphilosophers’ (14). It has no notes, a limited bibliography, and thirteen bite-sized chapters. For the most part I found it easy and fun to read, powered as it is by piquant examples of everyday wrongdoing involving multiple agents. The primary and official focus of the book, as its title suggests, is on the situation in which wrongdoing by one agent (the ‘principal’, in this review ‘P’) is supported by another (the ‘accomplice’, in this review ‘A’). However, the book also attends (especially in chs 3 and 6) to some cases of collective or group agency which are not naturally classified as complicity cases. It engages, too, with other nearby topics such as cooperation (ch 9) and conspiracy (ch 12). Mellema is excellent at revealing subtle connections among these topics. But he is not so good at providing orientation. His book is oddly organised, with no obvious rationale for the way in which material is sequenced. Meanwhile the (presumably deliberate) paucity of references means that valuable opportunities are missed to relate what is being said to a wider range of philosophical literature.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

That is not to say that Mellema ignores previous writings on complicity itself. On the contrary, each of Thomas Aquinas and Christopher Kutz has the honour of a chapter to himself (chs 2 and 3 respectively). H.D. Lewis and Karl Jaspers, representing opposite poles of radicalism about complicity — minimalist and maximalist respectively — share a chapter between them (ch 10). It is not clear that thesead hominemchapters represent optimal use of the limited space in the book. Let me qualify that: chapter 10 is a terrific read, full of testing and vexing thoughts. It is marred only by the fact that it comes too late to disabuse the reader of the comfortable bourgeois intuitions that are largely confirmed earlier in the book. The chapters on Aquinas and Kutz, by contrast, are intrinsically unsatisfying. They contain too much summary and too little (forthright) criticism. Quirks in each author’s scoping of the subject of complicity are thereby allowed to enter unchecked into Mellema’s own frame of analysis. Aquinas does not attach enough importance to the distinction between contributing to another’s wrongdoing on the one hand and contributing, on the other hand, to the wrongdoer’s getting away with her wrong or succeeding in her further purposes in committing it (‘complicity after the fact,’ as the common law calls it). Kutz, meanwhile, blends the puzzles of complicity prematurely into the puzzles of collective and group agency (foregrounding, e.g., the position of corporate shareholders and that of individual combatants in war). Mellema does too little to expose the difficulties to which these two moves give rise. His own positions and arguments, throughout the book, suffer from resulting contortions.

For example: Mellema wisely rules that ‘Apart from a contributing act, one cannot be complicit in the wrongdoing of another’ (68). Yet, with Aquinas’s taxonomy still in mind, he holds that A who ‘covers for’ (134) or ‘fails to denounce’ (68) P’s wrong could in principle be complicit in P’s wrong. How? Obviously it is too late now for A to contribute to P’s original wrong, which isex hypothesidone. A is now contributing, if to any wrong by P, then to a second wrong that P has not yet finished committing — say, that of evading justice in respect of her first wrong. Why say that this is A’s complicity (‘after the fact’) in P’s first wrong, rather than A’s complicity (‘before the fact’) in P’s second wrong? Mellema’s book would have been easier to follow, and closer to the truth, if he had gone for the second analysis and abandoned the whole idea of complicity ‘after the fact’ as a lawyer’s confusion. He could likewise have made the book simpler and sounder by keeping Kutz-inspired worries about corporations and their shareholders, armies and their soldiers, etc. completely out of the way until the more rudimentary cases involving an individual P and an individual A had been fully explored and analyzed. Ch 6 (on collective and shared responsibility), ch 9 (on well-integrated actions), and ch 11 (on indirect accomplices) could in my view have been more helpfully clustered towards the end of the book. Reflections on Kutz’s important but specialized contribution could equally have been reserved to that part of the book, instead of muddying the waters so near to the start. Mellema’s first instinct is right: the problems of collective and shared agency are only ‘tangentially related to the notion of complicity’ (41).

Aquinas and Kutz both contribute to expanding Mellema’s topic, somewhat awkwardly, beyond its natural boundaries. On another axis, however, Mellema strikes me as having artificially narrowed his topic and thereby relegated it, wrongly, to the sidelines of moral philosophy. He assumes from the start that ‘morally blameless complicity’ is an oxymoron (3). While this assumption does not strictly bar him from discussing justifications and excuses for (what would otherwise be) complicitous actions, it does license him to put these topics ‘beyond the scope of the discussion’ (15). So when questions come up that would usually be thought of as questions of justification or excuse (e.g. duress at 69, moral dilemmas at 81-2), they are rather cursorily parried or bypassed. Largely untreated in the book, therefore, are intriguing (and classic) problems about the moral position of undercover cops, anarchist judges, agents provocateurs, press-ganged conscripts, etc., who contribute to the wrongs of others so as to (as it seems to them) serve some greater good or avoid some terrible evil.

There is a connection here, I think, with Mellema’s paucity of references. It has been a central question of modern moral philosophy whether one could be justified, or at least excused, in contributing to another’s wrongdoing in order to avoid being a principal wrongdoer oneself. Think of Kant’s case of the murderer at the door, Williams’ example of Jim and the Indians, Sen’s story of Ali, Donna, and the bashers, and so on. Should one choose to be A rather than P in such cases, even when all else is equal? Mellema opines that, with some exceptions, Ps are more blameworthy than their counterpart As (5-6). But that question lies a long way downstream from the one that interests Kant, Williams, and Sen. If blameworthiness were the immediate issue for potential accomplices, then folks like Jim and Donna could breathe a sigh of relief. All they need is an excuse to relieve them of blame (as Mellema seems to agree: 15). In their dire situations that excuse will not be hard to find. Since they are deliberating about what to do, however, what Jim and Donna want to know is whether being A rather than P would be justified, not merely excused. Mellema does not isolate this upstream question. That leaves him giving the impression that there has not been much recent philosophical work on complicity, when in fact moral philosophy has been preoccupied with it for decades. On this score, I was struck by the contrast with Chiara Lepora and Robert E. Goodin’s 2013 bookOn Complicity and Compromise(not cited by Mellema) in which puzzles about the ethics of complicity are presented as pervading modern moral and political philosophy, albeit not always under that name (sometimes as ‘the problem of dirty hands’ or ‘the Solzhenitsyn principle’).

In spite of these difficulties with its scope and intellectual horizons, Mellema’s book does give pride of place to what is surely the key question for any study of the ethics of complicity, namely the question of what counts as contributing to another’s wrong. In the two chapters which in my view have the most solid claim to appear in it (chs 4 and 5), Mellema attends to enabling and facilitating contributions respectively. As his economical and lucid remarks nicely bring out, each of these raises puzzles for the idea of a ‘contribution’. If A sells P a rifle that P uses in an assassination, A enables the assassination. But what if there are other dealers around who would have sold P a similar weapon had A not been willing and able to do so? Likewise, if A gives P advice as to the ideal vantage point from which to fire the fatal shot, A facilitates the assassination. But what if, even without A’s advice, P would have found an adequate vantage point? In each case there is clearly a sense in which what A does make a difference to P’s wrongdoing, and another sense in which A doesn’t.

Mellema has sensible thoughts about what the former sense might be and why it would be the one that matters in identifying a complicitous contribution. But his analysis does not delve as deeply as that of some who went before him. It does not, indeed, display much awareness of previous delvings. In particular, there is no mention of the detailed investigations of H.L.A. Hart and A. M. Honoré in their joint bookCausation in the Law(1959, 2nd ed. 1985). True, Hart and Honoré did not venture many views on the ethics of complicity. Their interest lay mainly in the metaphysics — principally, indeed, in the same question that detains Mellema in chapters 4 and 5, the question of how one can be said to contribute to the wrongs of others by facilitating those wrongs, by enabling them, or for that matter by inducing them, encouraging them, permitting them, failing to prevent them, etc. One does not expect Mellema to rival Hart and Honoré for encyclopaedic treatment of these issues. But perhaps one could have wished for some engagement with their work. One might also have hoped for chapters on encouraging, inducing, and some other modes of contribution, to match those on enabling and facilitating. In some ways, as Mellema reveals in scattered, tantalising remarks on the subject, the problem of complicity by encouraging is the most complex and intriguing of them all. And the problem of complicity by failure to prevent, to which Mellema gives repeated but not sustained attention, is perhaps the one with the most far-reaching implications.

Inevitably this review has emphasized some themes of Mellema’s book to the neglect of others. Given more space I might have discussed Mellema’s novel distinction between accomplices who are responsible for the principal’s wrong and accomplices who are merely ‘tainted’ by that wrong (27-9). I might also have discussed his attempt (ch 8) to distinguish breach of moral obligation from disappointment of moral expectation (which is said to be ‘wrong’ yet not ‘forbidden’: 88). I found much to inspire and intrigue as well as to provoke in these passages, as indeed in the whole of the book. To repeat, it is an agreeable and stimulating read. Yet I cannot conceal my frustration that so many issues only ‘tangentially related to the notion of complicity’ vie for the reader’s attention within the short span ofComplicity and Moral Accountability. They do so, it seems to me, at the expense of methodical and tenacious attention to the book’s ostensible topic. Some nonphilosopher readers may thereby come to underestimate the contribution that philosophy has made, and is capable of making, to the study of complicity — and indeed vice versa. For such readers, the Lepore and Goodin book mentioned above would, I believe, be a better place to start. It is just as short and just as replete with memorable examples (theirs mainly concern humanitarian intervention in conflict zones, which is Lepore’s day job). However, Lepore and Goodin do a better job than Mellema of sticking to the advertised topic and locating it correctly (namely: dead centre) on the map of modern moral and political philosophy.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman develops an account of shared intentional activity grounded in individual intentions that interlock in specific ways. For shared cooperative activity, each participant must intend that they perform the joint action together, these intentions must be common knowledge, and each must be committed to supporting the other's role in the shared plan. This avoids positing irreducible collective mental states while explaining genuine joint action.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a framework for understanding delegation as a form of shared agency. When one delegates, one may still share intentions with the delegate (intending that we together accomplish the goal), rather than simply causing the delegate to act. This distinguishes morally loaded delegation (shared agency) from mere causal manipulation (using another as a tool).

This concept picks out a distinctive kind of interpersonal interaction, one that many of us see as important in our lives. You and I might sing a duet together, paint a house together, take a trip together, build something together, or run a give-and-gol together in a basketball game. In many such cases ours will be a shared cooperative activity. Such shared cooperative activities can involve large numbers of participating agents and can take place within a complex institutional frameworkconsider the activities of a symphony orchestra following its conductor. But to keep things simple I will focus here on shared cooperative activities that involve only a pair of participating agents and are not the activities of complex institutions with structures of authority. Shared cooperative activity (SCA) involves, of course, appropriate behaviors. If you and I successfully engage in the SCA of painting the house together then, of course, we paint the house together. But we might paint the house together without acting cooperatively. Perhaps neither of us even knows of the other's activities, or though we each know of the other's activities neither of us cares. Given appropriate behaviors, what else is needed for ours to be a SCA? Suppose that you and I sing a duet together, and that this is a SCA. I will be trying to be responsive to your intentions and actions, knowing that you will be trying to be responsive to my intentions and actions. This mutual responsiveness will be in the pursuit of a goal we each have, namely, our singing the duet.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman extends his earlier work on shared intentionality into a comprehensive planning theory of shared agency. He defends the view that shared agency emerges from interlocking individual intentions and shared policies, without requiring collective agents or irreducible "we-intentions." The framework accommodates hierarchical shared agency (including some forms of authority and delegation) while preserving individual rational agency.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how delegation can preserve shared agency. When a principal delegates to an agent within a framework of interlocking intentions and shared policies, the outcome may still reflect the principal's agency (though distributed through the relationship). This bears on whether delegated accomplishments can carry the same moral weight as individually performed ones.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schmitz and Bryson argue against the notion that AI systems create inevitable "ethics sinks" (structures that facilitate dissipation of responsibility). They propose a three-point framework for legitimate AI integration: (1) maintain clear human accountability lines, (2) ensure humans can verify AI system functioning, and (3) introduce AI only where it enhances transparency and legitimacy. AI should be treated as tools for organizational transparency, not as independent moral agents.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses responsibility in contexts where tasks are delegated to AI systems rather than human agents. The framework's insistence on maintaining human accountability lines suggests that technological delegation need not create responsibility gaps if properly structured. However, this leaves open whether choosing to delegate to AI rather than perform tasks oneself has intrinsic moral significance beyond accountability concerns.

In particular, perception or actuality of AI agency might create ethics sinks - constructs that facilitate dissipation of responsibility when AI systems of disputed moral status interface with bureaucratic structures. Here, we reject the notion that ethics sinks are a necessary consequence of introducing AI systems into bureaucracies. Rather, where they appear, they are the product of structural design decisions across both the technology and the institution deploying it. We support this claim via a systematic application of conceptions of moral agency in AI ethics to Weberian bureaucracy. We establish that it is both desirable and feasible to render AI systems as tools for the generation of organizational transparency and legibility, which continue the processes of Weberian rationalization initiated by previous waves of digitalization. We present a three-point Moral Agency Framework for legitimate integration of AI in bureaucratic structures: (a) maintain clear and just human lines of accountability, (b) ensure humans whose work is augmented by AI systems can verify the systems are functioning correctly, and (c) introduce AI only where it doesn't inhibit the capacity of bureaucracies towards either of their twin aims of legitimacy and stewardship. We suggest that AI introduced within this framework can not only improve efficiency and productivity while avoiding ethics sinks, but also improve the transparency and even the legitimacy of a bureaucracy.},

  RELEVANCE: Provides a framework for understanding responsibility when tasks are delegated to AI systems. Rather than locating responsibility solely with human designers, users, or the AI itself, distributed responsibility assigns accountability to each agent based on their contribution.

The high level of its autonomy in functioning does not correspond to the classical instrumentalist approach to technology, as it turns out to be capable of funda­mentally uncontrollable actions in the process of performing the task assigned to it. For the same reason, the classical definition of moral responsibility does not adequately corre­spond to the actual situation in the field of artificial intelligence development, which often leads to problems that hinder the development of this technology. Therefore, the article con­ceptualizes a new technology-appropriate way of describing the relationship of responsibil­ity in the field of artificial intelligence ethics. To achieve this goal artificial intelligence is considered as a participant in various interactions, including social ones, possessing agency, but at the same time as not attributed with true intentionality, motivation, awareness and other properties that are necessary for attributing agency in the classical model of the rela­tionship of responsibility. In addition to referring to Floridi’s description of agency criteria, the justification of such a consideration of AI is based on Annamarie Mol and Marianne de Laet’s concept of fluidity which is developed by them, among others, to denote the ability of technologies to possess agency without having the properties considered necessary for at­tributing agency in the classical model of the role of technologies in social processes. AI technology is analyzed as a complex heterogeneous sociotechnical system made up of both human and non-human agents. The risk of leveling the significance of responsibility in such a system is overcome at the conceptual level by adapting the approach of Floridi’s patient-oriented morality. Changing the emphasis from the subject of action to the object of influence gives moral significance to the entire sum of morally neutral actions that are performed by agents within the framework of a sociotechnical system. Since it produces morally significant effects and impacts, it also acts as a bearer of the relation of responsibi­lity which, as shown in the article, applies to each agent of the system equally thereby inten­sifying moral responsibility in the field of AI.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Xia proposes a framework based on externalist agency and distributed responsibility to address responsibility gaps created by autonomous AI systems. Agency is treated as gradient (not all-or-nothing), with intermediate levels including distributed agency, constrained agency, and derivative agency. Responsibility should be allocated according to these gradients, with both humans and artifacts bearing responsibility based on their degree of agency.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a nuanced framework for assessing responsibility when humans delegate tasks to increasingly autonomous AI systems. By treating agency and responsibility as matters of degree, Xia's framework accommodates cases where neither the human principal nor the AI agent bears full responsibility. This bears on whether and how delegating to AI systems differs morally from delegating to human agents.

  POSITION: Gradient theory of agency; distributed responsibility framework for human-AI interaction.

  abstract = {The rise of automation, such as artificial intelligence, has significantly reduced human agency in artifact-involving actions, thereby giving rise to a moral dilemma known as the responsibility gap. In this dilemma, moral undesirable consequences arise from technology, yet no one is held accountable because individuals lack control over their actions and their outcomes, as well as the ability to predict these outcomes, rendering them morally blameless. This paper proposes a framework based on externalist agency and distributed responsibility, aiming to address this problem by assigning accountability to artifacts. Externalist agency holds that agency is a gradient concept rather than an all-or-nothing one. Between fully autonomous agency and non-agency, there are three intermediate gradients: distributed agency, constrained agency, and derivative agency. Distributed responsibility holds that responsibility should be allocated according to these gradients of agency. For both humans and artifacts: if an agent possesses derivative agency, forgiveness is warranted; if it possesses distributed agency, punishment is justifiable. This paper further suggests that punishment for artifacts can take the form of punishment for technological lineage—that is, modifying the design of technologies to guide their evolution toward safer and more ethical directions.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lambrecht examines whether collective agents can escape responsibility by inducing their own moral incapacity (e.g., through organizational changes that make ethical reasoning impossible). He argues that Niels De Haan's solution—holding groups responsible once they reacquire capacity—is incomplete without an "Attributability Proviso": actions must still be attributable to the group despite changes it has undergone.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a strategic dimension of delegation: can principals avoid responsibility by delegating to agents they have structured to be morally incapacitated? Lambrecht's attributability requirement suggests that strategic delegation to escape responsibility fails if the delegation itself reflects the principal's agency. This bears on the moral evaluation of choosing organizational structures that diffuse responsibility.

  POSITION: Defends attributability condition for collective responsibility across organizational change.

Self-induced moral incapacity seems to introduce a responsibility gap that corporate agents might exploit to avoid responsibility. De Haan argues that the problem does not introduce responsibility gaps because collective moral agents become responsible for actions they committed while they were incapacitated once they reacquire moral capacity. I argue that de Haan’s argument is incomplete. Simply because a group reacquires moral capacity does not also necessarily mean that the group retains attributability for the wrongs in question. This means we must supplement de Haan’s argument with an Attributability Proviso: To overcome the problem of self-induced moral incapacity it must be the case that the group reacquires moral capacity and that we can still attribute the earlier actions to the group despite the changes that it has gone through.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schwenkenbecher examines whether corporations, like psychopaths, lack capacities constitutive of moral agency. While both may lack moral emotions and show rational failures, she argues corporations remain morally responsible because they are responsible for establishing their own internal epistemic structures and decision-making processes. Unlike psychopaths' inherent deficits, corporate irrationality is chosen or permitted.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether delegating decision-making to corporate structures (which may lack moral emotions) diminishes responsibility. Schwenkenbecher's argument that corporations are responsible for their own epistemic integrity suggests principals cannot escape responsibility by delegating to morally deficient organizational structures they have created or sustained.

  POSITION: Defends full corporate moral responsibility despite parallels with psychopathy.

  abstract = {There seems to be a striking parallel between the features of psychopaths and those of agential groups, including states and corporations. Psychopaths are often thought to lack some of the capacities that are constitutive of moral agency. Two features of psychopaths are commonly identified as grounds for limiting their moral responsibility: (i) their lack of relevant emotional capacities and (ii) their flawed rational capacities. Roughly, the first argument is that the lack of moral emotions such as sympathy, guilt, or shame negatively impacts moral perception and therewith an agent's capacity for moral reasoning. The second argument is that psychopaths are diminished in their agency as such, not just in their moral agency; they are erratic and impulsive and show other significant failures of rationality. Using the 2020 Juukan Gorge disaster in Western Australia as a case study, I conclude that deliberate or reckless corporate irrationality cannot be grounds for diminished corporate moral responsibility. Corporate agents are chiefly responsible for core aspects of their moral agency, including their internal epistemic structures and decision‐making processes. They have obligations to establish or maintain internal epistemic integrity and consistency.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Blomberg reviews Mellema's work on complicity, highlighting the distinction between sharing responsibility for an outcome versus being blameworthy for one's contributory action. An accomplice to wrongdoing is always blameworthy for their contribution, but whether they share responsibility for the outcome depends on the nature of their contribution. Blomberg also discusses "moral taint"—negative effects on moral status from association with wrongdoing, even without responsibility for the outcome.

  RELEVANCE: Distinguishes between responsibility for outcomes and blameworthiness for participation, crucial for evaluating delegation. When one delegates tasks to others who perform wrongful acts, one may be blameworthy for the delegation decision even if not responsible for the ultimate outcome. The concept of "moral taint" suggests association through delegation can affect moral standing even without full responsibility.

  POSITION: Distinguishes outcome-responsibility from contribution-blameworthiness; introduces moral taint concept.

  keywords = {complicity, moral-taint, blameworthiness, Low},
  abstract = {In this short book, Mellema examines the phenomenon of complicity in wrongdoing, that is, the phenomenon of being an accomplice to a principal agent causing harm. He also examines related phenomena such as collective and shared responsibility, as well as enabling, facilitating, and condoning harm produced by others. An agent is an accomplice to a principal agent’s wrongdoing if she contributes to the outcome in certain ways. According to Mellema, she must not only perform some kind of contributory action or intentionally omit to perform an action. She must also be aware of the principal agent’s wrongdoing. An accomplice may share in the responsibility for the outcome of the principal agent’s wrongdoing. In part, whether she does share in it depends on the nature of the contributory action or omission. In the absence of a valid excuse, she is also always morally blameworthy for her contributory action or omission itself. Mellema draws on Thomas Aquinas’ discussion of “accessory sins” to characterise different kinds of contributory actions or omissions. As Mellema plausibly argues, these accessory sins can be understood as ways in which one can become complicit in someone else’s wrongdoing. For example, one can become complicit in another’s wrongdoing in virtue of commanding, counselling, or encouraging them with respect to their wrongdoing, or in virtue of consenting to, not denouncing, or in participating in their wrong doing. If I merely encourage you to shoplift, then I am normally not responsible for the shopkeeper’s loss after your theft, but if I rather actively participate in your shoplifting by distracting the security guard as you stuff your pockets, then I am also responsible for the shopkeeper’s loss. Drawing on Appiah’s (1991) work, Mellema argues that in the former kind of case, an accomplice can nevertheless be “morally tainted” by a wrongdoing even if she is not responsible for it. This moral taint effects her moral status negatively in virtue of her being associated or related to the principal agent is certain ways. Mellema illustrates the idea of moral taint with an example case taken from Kutz (2000, pp. 163–164). The case involves a pacifist employee who works on a project for the United States Department of Defense. According to Mellema, the},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stamatiou distinguishes two aspects of control necessary for moral responsibility: choice (selecting among alternatives) and agenthood (the agent's causal efficacy in bringing about the choice). He argues that both aspects can be realized by human psychology, defending control-based theories against empirical challenges from neuroscience and conceptual worries about the disappearance of the agent in psychological explanations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides a framework for distinguishing control retained in delegation from control relinquished. When one delegates, one may retain choice control (selecting the delegate and goal) while relinquishing agenthood control (the causal process bringing about the outcome). This distinction may matter for assessing the moral significance of personal versus delegated action.

  POSITION: Defends two-component control theory; argues psychological accounts preserve both choice and agenthood.

Are there good reasons to think that humans can psychologically realise control? This paper is an attempt to address this question by establishing choice and agenthood as separate but interconnected aspects of control. I consider two challenges to the claim that humans can realise the kind of control required for moral responsibility. First, an empirical challenge from cognitive neuroscience provides a familiar way to argue against the realisation of the choice aspect by human psychology. Second, a more formidable conceptual challenge to the aspect of agenthood presents us with scepticism about the kind of explanations that psychology can provide. The second challenge suggests that, in psychological accounts of choice, the agent disappears. Drawing on recent empirical models of cognitive control and philosophical accounts of agency, I conclude that the psychological explanation of choice is consistent with the aspect of agenthood being realised by human psychology.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Simone de Beauvoir, Winckler-Olick argues that our responsibility extends beyond consequences we directly cause to include contributions our actions make to shared public values. She proposes an "Extended Range View" under which agents are responsible for shaping the evaluative landscape through their actions, thereby sharing responsibility for the free actions of others who navigate that landscape.

  RELEVANCE: Suggests a novel dimension of responsibility relevant to delegation: when one delegates, one not only distributes causal responsibility but also shapes public values about the acceptability of delegation itself. If delegation becomes a widespread practice, it may alter the evaluative landscape in ways that affect everyone's options and values. This extends responsibility beyond individual delegation decisions.

  POSITION: Extended range view of responsibility; responsibility for contributions to shared values.

If we properly appreciate the moral weight of our contributions to the value systems that we all engage in—what I will call our evaluative landscape—then we can explain how we can be responsible for the free actions of others. This view significantly extends what we will need to think of as our responsibility (though not to a fully unrestricted range). I will also suggest, however, that we accept a pluralist view about responsibility on which the way that we take responsibility and hold agents responsible for these kinds of value‐based contributions is different from the standard responsibility practices like blame, punishment, and guilt.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sartorio examines the relationship between agency and responsibility in criminal law contexts, focusing on how legal doctrines of actus reus and mens rea track philosophical concepts of agency and control. She argues that criminal responsibility requires not just causation but a specific form of agency: the defendant's action must flow from their practical reasoning in ways that make the outcome attributable to them.

  RELEVANCE: Provides legal-philosophical resources for thinking about responsibility in delegation contexts. Criminal law's doctrines of complicity and conspiracy offer frameworks for assessing when delegating tasks to others generates criminal liability. The actus reus requirement (voluntary act) may illuminate when delegation preserves versus severs the connection between principal and outcome.

For example, we cannot be held liable for harmful consequences of involuntary behaviors such as muscle spasms, reflexes, seizures, episodes of sleepwalking, etc., for which we are not morally responsible. Simester embraces this basic assumption; however, he also challenges some standard assumptions about moral responsibility itself—in particular, he challenges the standard way of understanding the relationship between moral responsibility, voluntariness, and agency—and argues for an alternative view. This paper is a critical examination of Simester’s arguments and thoughts on this important topic.
