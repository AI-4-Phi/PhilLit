At the\ncore of this transformation is the reformulation of\n\u201cwell-being\u201d ( eudaimonia ) as the normative ideal\nof authenticity, which can be of help in reconstructing a contemporary\nunderstanding of normativity. For Ferrara, it can ground a new ideal\nof universal validity \u201cultimately linked with the model of\nexemplary uniqueness or enlightening singularity thus far associated\nwith \u2018aesthetics\u2019\u201d (Ferrara 1998: 10).
