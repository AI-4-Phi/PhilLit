      "abstract": "Since the second half of the twentieth century, the principle of autonomy has come to be regarded as the cornerstone of medical ethics. Older principles of medical ethics, such as beneficence and non-maleficence, both of which can be subsumed under the concept of \u201ccare\u201d, have correspondingly decreased in importance. Drawing on hermeneutic analyses of the constitutive interrelations between autonomous will-formation on the one hand, and well-being and social embeddedness on the other hand, it will be argued that a proper understanding of autonomy necessarily incorporates attention to well-being and care, and vice versa. The true ethical challenge is not to determine whether autonomy or care ought to take precedence, but to understand respecting autonomy and providing care as two aspects of one and the same ethical demand to attend to and help other individuals.",

We apply the lenses of Joan Tronto's political, or democratic ethics of care, and Fiona Robinson's critical ethics of care, to conduct an ideology critique of the aid agencies' expressed goal of refugees' economic \u2018self-reliance\u2019. We demonstrate that their underlying assumptions about \u2018dependency\u2019 and \u2018autonomy\u2019, in conjunction with Zimbabwe's policy of refugee encampment, are at the heart of the income generation activities\u2019 lack of sustainability. We argue further that all caring relationships are characterised by unequal power relations, and that this needs to be acknowledged in order to enable a shared commitment to equal participation, in a partnership towards agreed-upon development goals. Moreover, the ideologies of autonomy and self-reliance must be replaced with a policy commitment to fostering interdependence as the ontological condition under which income generating activities can evolve into sustainable livelihoods. We recommend that the critical ethics of care and the radical-democratic practices for which it calls, provide an apt framework within which to reconsider the policies governing refugee support and practices, so as to foster a caring context for human wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "\n Increasing evidence suggests a global shift in education towards market-driven policy has eroded fundamental human virtues including relationships, empathy, responsiveness, and important of collective practices, resulting in a moral crisis of care that affects students, teachers, and families. This shift has led to what Butler terms moral precarity, raising concerns that younger generation may lose their sense of responsibility and commitment to care for others. Drawing on existing literature, this paper suggests that the ethics of care with its relational ontology and maternal epistemology provides a robust ethical framework to address these challenges. However, critics argue that care ethics may inadvertently neglect respect for autonomy, creating a tension between relational interdependence and individual autonomy. This paper posits that non-affirmative theory offers conceptual tools, particularly through the notions of summoning to self-activity and recognition, to address this ontological tension. Summoning reframes autonomy as a relational practice, enabling critical self-awareness and moral agency within caring relationships. This integration transforms the ethics of care from a relational ontology to a relational-autonomous ontology, emphasizing the dynamic interplay of interdependence and autonomy. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this reinterpretation for school pedagogy and policy, suggesting an ethical reorientation of neoliberal practices to foster a pedagogy grounded in care and autonomy. Future research directions include empirical studies on implementing relational-autonomous pedagogy to promote caring schools where the young generation have the capacity to care for others while respecting their autonomy.",

      "abstract": "The progression of SARS-CoV-2 from outbreak through epidemic to pandemic has generated a wave of medical, social, financial and political consequences. Such profound burden of disease worldwide has brought to the fore ethical challenges that are otherwise experienced only once in a generation. At the operational level, these include resuscitation decisions, critical care triage, allocations of finite resources, testing, protective equipment, prioritisation of treatment and collateral damage; and at the societal level, public-private partnerships, disparities, ethnic minority and social justice, to name but a few. Colleagues across Europe and worldwide have responded admirably to such unprecedented challenges [1\u20137]. The principles of patient-centred ethics have shifted to public health ethics and the ethics of a pandemic (see Table 1). The focus is no longer the individual patient, but the community and population as a whole. Individual liberty and autonomy give way to relational autonomy and the interdependence of people. The authority vested in the prestige of the medical profession shifts to the authority vested in the policing power of the state and the law. The social good and the avoidance of social harm take priority over an individual patient\u2019s beneficence and non-maleficence. Eijkholt et al. discuss what are our true ethical responsibilities that arise with the scarcity of resources, such as personal protective equipment (PPE), which may put us at the risk of contracting the virus [8]. Is putting ourselves at risk a supererogatory act of moral heroism or an irresponsible action that in itself can lead to a scarcity of healthcare providers? Even though neurosurgery is a small specialty, it has finite resources and by nature deals with time-dependent and treatment-limiting decisions or actions that are related to the ethics of life preservation. In a survey of comparative activity before and during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic across several European centres, 80% reported they were no longer able to provide neurosurgical care according to legitimate medical needs [9]. This inevitably brought with it moral distress and ethical challenges, such as the prioritisation of patients, triaging and even rationing [4, 9]. These terms, with important semantic differences, may vary in different healthcare systems, relative to their ability to adapt to the huge stress of a pandemic. As we navigate ourselves through the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic within the same year, do we have the moral substance, and can we rely on ethical standards plus guidance so as to make professional decisions that will be publicly and socially accountable? Do we have ethical support structures and processes? Do our healthcare structures possess the systemic consistency in regulatory frameworks and in institutional culture to facilitate ethical decision-making?",

      "abstract": "This study explores how African ethics of care can provide a philosophically sound and culturally based basis for rethinking inclusive education for students with disabilities throughout the African continent. Even though inclusive education is increasingly supported by national policies in nations like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana, students' everyday experiences show a persistent disconnect between policy commitments and school realities. The dependence on Western models of inclusion, which presume autonomy is attained through independence and self-sufficiency, is largely to blame for this disparity. On the other hand, many African communities view human development through relational values, which place a strong emphasis on shared responsibility, care, and interdependence. These principles, which are embodied in Ubuntu and more general communitarian ideologies, offer conceptual tools for redefining inclusion as involvement bolstered by deep connections. The study uses a qualitative research design that includes focus groups, classroom observations, policy document analysis, and interviews with educators, caregivers, school administrators, and students with disabilities. This method explains how relational ethics are applied in educational settings and the conflicts that result from institutional frameworks that prioritize individualistic conceptions of autonomy. The theoretical foundation for interpreting these results comes from African philosophical literature, especially Metz's explanation of moral harmony and communal identity (Metz, 2007).\nThe findings demonstrate that although communities frequently have strong caring values, educational systems find it difficult to actualize them because of a lack of resources, inadequate teacher preparation, deeply ingrained stigma, and curricula that ignore relational perspectives and local knowledge. Students frequently stress how important acceptance and belonging are to their educational experiences. Students with disabilities show higher levels of participation, confidence, and engagement in schools that consciously foster support relationships. The study concludes that by redefining inclusion as a shared moral endeavor in which autonomy develops through interdependence rather than isolation, African ethics of care can enhance international discussions.",

It identifies the fallacy of the altruistic argument, which frames women\u2019s self-sacrifice in reproductive and caregiving roles as a natural virtue, reinforcing gender inequalities and limiting autonomy. Through an interdisciplinary approach integrating feminist philosophy, evolutionary theory, and social justice perspectives, it exposes androcentric biases in evolutionary epistemology that have legitimized the exploitation of women\u2019s reproductive labor by portraying altruism as a biologically determined, sex-specific trait. Drawing on Adriana Cavarero\u2019s relational ethics, the paper advocates for reimagining reproduction as a collective act rooted in mutual care, ethical responsibility, and interdependence. This perspective challenges Western individualism and calls for positioning reproduction as a central ethical and philosophical category. By rejecting narratives of self-sacrifice, it promotes an ethos of mutuality, fostering a more equitable and inclusive approach to reproductive practices and policies.",

These frameworks often overlook the emotional, relational, and embodied dimensions of moral life, particularly in contexts of caregiving, migration, and structural vulnerability. Feminist theorists such as Carol Gilligan, Virginia Held, and Joan Tronto have advanced the ethics of care as a critical response to this moral abstraction. This paper explores how care ethics reorients global justice by foregrounding dependency, responsiveness, and moral proximity. Through case studies including vaccine apartheid, global care chains, and refugee policy, it demonstrates the ethical insufficiency of justice without care. Rather than discarding justice, the care perspective deepens it\u2014 transforming foreign policy, institutional ethics, and global governance. The study ultimately proposes care ethics as an urgent philosophical and political corrective to the moral blind spots of the liberal order.",

This conceptualization bears resemblance to the notion of relational autonomy as expounded in care ethics. In Smith\u2019s framework, morality is a product of societal interactions facilitated by the sympathetic process and the impartial spectator, that lead individuals to emerge as moral subjects. The interplay of sympathy, self-interest, society, and the conception of the individual as delineated in TMS could provide a robust foundation for a theory of relational autonomy that integrates the social, as care ethics proposes, and that does not sacrifice justice and individual rights.",

      "abstract": "It is a common view that artificial systems could play an important role in dealing with the shortage of caregivers due to demographic change. One argument to show that this is also in the interest of care-dependent persons is that artificial systems might significantly enhance user autonomy since they might stay longer in their homes. This argument presupposes that the artificial systems in question do not require permanent supervision and control by human caregivers. For this reason, they need the capacity for some degree of moral decision-making and agency to cope with morally relevant situations (artificial morality). Machine ethics provides the theoretical and ethical framework for artificial morality. This article scrutinizes the question how artificial moral agents that enhance user autonomy could look like. It discusses, in particular, the suggestion that they should be designed as moral avatars of their users to enhance user autonomy in a substantial sense.",

Nevertheless, empirical studies show that decision-making, exclusively focused on the individual exercise of autonomy fails to align well with patients\u2019 preferences at the end of life. The need for a more contextualized approach that meets real-life complexities experienced in end-of-life practices has been repeatedly advocated. In this regard, the notion of \u2018relational autonomy\u2019 may be a suitable alternative approach. Relational autonomy has even been advanced as a foundational notion of palliative care, shared decision-making, and advance-care planning.

This paper starts by critically examining the existing approaches to the ethical design of care robots provided by Aimee van Wynsberghe, who relies on the work on the ethics of care by Joan Tronto. In doing so, it suggests an alternative to their non-principled approach, an alternative suited to tackling some of the issues raised by Tronto and van Wynsberghe, while allowing for the inclusion of two orientative principles. Our proposal centres on the principles of autonomy and vulnerability, whose joint adoption we deem able to constitute an original revision of a bottom-up approach in care ethics. Conclusively, the ethical framework introduced here integrates more traditional approaches in care ethics in view of enhancing the debate regarding the ethical design of care robots under a new lens.",

However, recent studies show that young people perceive their influence both at school and in society as limited, which decreases their civic activity later in life. The aim of this theoretical study is to reeval-uate democratic education through feminist care ethics, which is an under-researched topic in the current theoretical debate. In our article, we outline a novel approach to caring democratic education (i.e., care-full democratic education), which presents a complementary stance toward current democratic education, which relies heavily on the theories of liberal democracy and a rational and atomistic subject. Instead of an individualistic emphasis, our approach cultivates the idea of relational autonomy, interconnectedness, and respecting mundane practices in schools as the basis for child-oriented democratic education. In addition, our study dismantles some of the structural injustices (childism and privileged irresponsibility) that we have identified in society and in education, which hinder the realization of democratic culture in basic education.",

In this article, we argue that this concept of autonomy is often annulled in the maternity field, due to the maternal two-in-one body (and the obstetric focus on the foetus over the woman) and the history of medical paternalism in Western medicine and obstetrics. The principle of respect for autonomy has therefore become largely rhetorical, yet can hide all manner of unethical practice. We propose that large institutions that prioritize a midwife\u2013institution relationship over a midwife\u2013woman relationship are in themselves unethical and inimical to the midwifery philosophy of care. We suggest that a focus on care ethics has the potential to remedy these problems, by making power relationships visible and by prioritizing the relationship above abstract ethical principles.",

      "abstract": "Respect for autonomy is a key concept in contemporary bioethics and end-of-life ethics in particular. Despite this status, an individualistic interpretation of autonomy is being challenged from the perspective of different theoretical traditions. Many authors claim that the principle of respect for autonomy needs to be reconceptualised starting from a relational viewpoint. Along these lines, the notion of relational autonomy is attracting increasing attention in medical ethics. Yet, others argue that relational autonomy needs further clarification in order to be adequately operationalised for medical practice. To this end, we examined the meaning, foundations, and uses of relational autonomy in the specific literature of end-of-life care ethics. Using PRESS and PRISMA procedures, we conducted a systematic review of argument-based ethics publications in 8 major databases of biomedical, philosophy, and theology literature that focused on relational autonomy in end-of-life care. Full articles were screened. All included articles were critically appraised, and a synthesis was produced. Fifty publications met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight articles were published in the last 5 years; publications were originating from 18 different countries. Results are organized according to: (a) an individualistic interpretation of autonomy; (b) critiques of this individualistic interpretation of autonomy; (c) relational autonomy as theoretically conceptualised; (d) relational autonomy as applied to clinical practice and moral judgment in end-of-life situations. Three main conclusions were reached. First, literature on relational autonomy tends to be more a \u2018reaction against\u2019 an individualistic interpretation of autonomy rather than be a positive concept itself. Dichotomic thinking can be overcome by a deeper development of the philosophical foundations of autonomy. Second, relational autonomy is a rich and complex concept, formulated in complementary ways from different philosophical sources. New dialogue among traditionally divergent standpoints will clarify the meaning. Third, our analysis stresses the need for dialogical developments in decision making in end-of-life situations. Integration of these three elements will likely lead to a clearer conceptualisation of relational autonomy in end-of-life care ethics. This should in turn lead to better decision-making in real-life situations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this paper I argue that by using methods of encouragement, derived from the fields of social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral economics, healthcare workers can potentially provide their patients with tools for increasing adherence to their treatment plans. I claim that the shared decision-making model can, and should, be enriched to include a component that encourages patients to follow through with their plans. It is commonsense that it is one thing to decide on a plan, and quite another to stick to it. Even if a plan is one\u2019s own, people often backslide with respect to their prior commitments. I appeal to the extensive literatures on decision-making, delay discounting, and willpower to provide some empirically verified tools for motivating patients. Importantly, I argue that contrary to appearances, motivating others to act with respect to their commitments expresses a respect for autonomy and is non-paternalistic.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The first Fallen Surgeons Military Educational Symposium was convened in conjunction with the the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) 23 meeting, under the guidance of the AAST Military Liaison Committee. The daylong session included a 1.5-hour segment on military medical ethics in combat and its unique challenges. Medical ethical issues arise frequently within the military across a range of varied circumstances, from the day-to-day operations of stateside forces to the complexities of deployed troops in theaters of conflict. Given the scope of these circumstances, preparation and advanced planning are the key to addressing and resolving the ethical issues that occur. The goal of this session was to present illustrative cases, not to prescribe solutions, and to make the attendees aware of some of the challenges they may encounter when deployed. Military surgeons may, at times, may be forced to balance a patient\u2019s autonomy against other competing needs. Decisions a physician may be faced with in order to support successful completion of the mission may not always align with their duty to the respect the autonomy of the patient they are treating. This concept of dual loyalties is a known ethical conflict experienced by military medical providers. This case discusses a grievously injured soldier who declines potentially lifesaving surgery and the ethical challenges posed to the care team.",

      "abstract": "Decisions about how and where they deliver their baby are extremely important to pregnant women. There are very strong ethical norms that women\u2019s autonomy should be respected, and that plans around birth should be personalised. However, there appear to be profound challenges in practice to respecting women\u2019s choices in pregnancy and labour. Choices carry risks and consequences\u2014to the woman and her child; also potentially to her caregivers and to other women. What does it mean for women\u2019s autonomy to be respected in obstetrics? How should health professionals respond to refusals of treatment or requests for care outside normal guidelines? What are the ethical limits to autonomy? In this clinical ethics round table, service users, midwives, obstetricians, philosophers and ethicists respond to two hypothetical cases drawn from real-life scenarios.",
