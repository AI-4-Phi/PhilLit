      "abstract": "In this paper we propose a model for examining personal identity development that moves attention from a relatively exclusive examination of the individual to an examination of the intersection between self and society. We propose that a master narrative model of identity development allows researchers to: (a) align the study of culture and individual on the same metric of narrative, (b) investigate the processes of negotiating personal and cultural narratives, the latter of which are embedded within the structures of society, and (c) investigate the internalization of those structures in personal identities. In laying out this model we define a narrative approach to identity development, five principles for defining master narratives (ubiquity, utility, invisibility, rigidity, and their compulsory nature), three types of master narratives (life course, structural, and episodic), and case examples of each type. This model brings attention to the interaction between self and society, as well as to the constraints on individual agency to construct a personal identity. We conclude by raising questions that emerge out of this framework that we hope will inspire future work on the relationship between self and society in the study of identity development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Northern Indigenous communities are experiencing rapid climate change and disrupted seasonal transitions. The Teet\u0142'it Gwich'in use a five\u2010season calendar to measure the year, indicating the timing of seasonal events and associated cultural practices. From trapping in the spring, to fishing in the summer and fall, and hunting in the fall and winter, the Gwich'in have moved upon the land with the changing seasons. However, disrupted seasonal synchrony can disconnect cultural practices from suitable conditions, creating risks to self and culture. With warming temperatures, communities have observed slower river freeze\u2010up in the fall and faster spring thaw, which has impacted the timing of when fishers can safely set their nets under river ice. Historically, freeze\u2010up occurred in October, providing several weeks when fishers could set nets under ice while \u0142uk dagaii (broad whitefish, Coregonus nasus ) traveled downriver. Today, freeze\u2010up often begins in November, and fishing during the \u0142uk dagaii migration requires setting nets while the ice is thinner and the river is not completely frozen. This presents risks to individuals working to maintain a fundamental cultural practice. Here, Arlyn Charlie, a Teet\u0142'it Gwich'in artist whose career focuses on culture and language, uses personal narrative to explore impacts of climate change on Gwich'in culture. Arlyn notes how these changes are making the traditional seasonal calendar unreliable, and explores how changing patterns among animals and the landscape no longer provide consistent, safe harvesting conditions. With a growing risk of working on thin ice, ongoing cultural practices are threatened.",

      "abstract": "Online communities provide support for those who are vulnerable, such as LGBTQ people while coming out. Research shows that social support and personal narrative construction are important when recovering from personal crises and traumatic events. As an online community focused on writing fanfiction and also consisting of a large number of LGBTQ members, transformative fandom provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between support, crisis, and narrative. Through an interview study with 31 LGBTQ fanfiction authors, our findings mirror Herman's model of trauma recovery: these spaces self-organize to support recovery work through constructing \"community narratives\" that help LGBTQ people establish safety when exploring their identity and build LGBTQ support structures without publicly outing themselves before they are ready, challenge stereotypes, and support others through reshaping existing media that perpetuate inaccurate or harmful LGBTQ narratives. These online communities embody \"selective visibility\"--that is, though not specifically designed as support structures for identity work and recovery, their design allows people to selectively find and create communities of support for stigmatized issues that they might be unable to safely seek out in other spaces. Based on lessons learned, we generate insights that can inform the design of safe support spaces online.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental goal of medical education is the active, constructive, transformative process of professional identity formation (PIF). Medical educators are thus charged with designing standardized and personalized curricula for guiding, supporting, and challenging learners on the developmental professional identity pathway, including the process of socialization. The author of this Commentary provides an overview of foundational principles and key drivers of PIF supporting the being, relating, and doing the work of a compassionate and competent physician. Key elements of PIF including guided reflection, use of personal narratives, integral role of relationships and role modeling, and community of practice are viewed through various lenses of PIF theory and pedagogy. Questions informing the PIF discourse are raised, including interprofessional identity considerations. Central emergent themes of reflective practice, relationships, and resilience are described as supporting and reciprocally enhancing PIF. Overarching lessons include attending to learners' and faculty's PIF within a developmental trajectory of the professional life cycle; process and content within PIF curricula as well as learners' individual and collective voices; curricular/extracurricular factors contributing to socialization, self-awareness, development of core values, and moral leadership; integrating PIF domains within pedagogy; faculty development for skilled mentoring and reflective coaching; and implementing resilience-promoting skill sets as \"protective\" within PIF. Outcomes assessment including the impact of curricula on learners and on patient-centered care can be challenging, and potential next steps toward this goal are discussed.",

Social network sites like Instagram offer unprecedented opportunity for image-based sharing. In this paper, we investigate sensitive self-disclosures on Instagram and the responses they attract. We use visual and textual qualitative content analysis and statistical methods to analyze self-disclosures, associated comments, and relationships between them. We find that people use Instagram to engage in social exchange and story-telling about difficult experiences. We find considerable evidence of social support, a sense of community, and little aggression or support for harmful or pro-disease behaviors. Finally, we report on factors that influence engagement and the type of comments these disclosures attract. Personal narratives, food and beverage, references to illness, and self-appearance concerns are more likely to attract positive social support. Posts seeking support attract significantly more comments. CAUTION: This paper includes some detailed examples of content about eating disorders and self-injury illnesses.",

      "abstract": "This article argues that, by the 1970s, people in Britain were increasingly insistent about defining and claiming their individual rights, identities and perspectives. Using individual narratives and testimonies, we show that many were expressing desires for greater personal autonomy and self-determination. We suggest that this was an important trend across the post-war decades, and of particular importance to understanding the 1970s. This popular individualism was not the result of Thatcher; if anything, it was a cause of Thatcherism. But this individualism had multiple political and cultural valences; desires for greater individual self-determination, and anger with the 'establishment' for withholding it, did not lead inexorably to Thatcherism. There were, in fact, some sources for, and potential outlets for, popular individualism on the left-outlets that explicitly challenged class, gender and racial inequalities. With this, we suggest the possibility of a new meta-narrative of post-war Britain, cutting across the political narrative that organizes post-war British history into three periods: social democracy, 'crisis' and the triumph of 'neoliberalism'. The 1970s was a key moment in the spread of a popular, aspirational form of individualism in post-war Britain, and this development is critical to our understanding of the history of the post-war years.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Robust literatures have shown that developing a coherent and integrated understanding of oneself\u2014a personal identity\u2014is best accomplished within relational contexts. Undoubtedly one of the most fundamental relational contexts is the family. And one of the most ubiquitous activities in which families engage is storytelling. It is within the family and through these stories that the self takes on its earliest and most lasting form. These stories are often told for fun, to be close, and to feel a sense of kinship. But these stories can also confine individuals into prescribed, and unwanted, roles and identities. Thus, family stories can be fertile ground for the development of identity, as stories to react against or to embrace. This book addresses how adolescents and emerging adults negotiate with these stories to develop a personal identity, using a sociocultural framework of narrative identity development.",

Through in-depth narrative interviews, this study sought to understand the lived experiences of 11 LGBTQ+ undergraduates ( age range = 19-23) building narrative identities in the cultural context of social media and the role of social media within this process. Interviews were analyzed using an interpretative, individual analysis of personal stories. These experiences were then compared and contrasted through thematic analysis to identify four shared narrative themes. Narratives of merging safe spaces highlight how LGBTQ+ youth now have regular access to safe environments online/offline which facilitate more secure identity development. Narratives of external identity alignment describe social media as a tool for LGBTQ+ youth to seek out identities that match their preexisting sense of self. Narratives of multiple context-based identities encapsulate how adolescents\u2019 identity markers are multiple and invoked in a context-dependent manner. Finally, narratives of individuality and autonomy characterize how LGBTQ+ youth perceive themselves as highly individualized members of a wider community. These findings highlight the complex role social media plays within LGBTQ+ youth identity development. The implications are discussed within.",

Pedagogy, values, and professional and personal narratives of self are all affected, particularly by technological change. This paper explores the role and identity shifts of academics during the introduction of large-class videoconferencing. Their experiences of personal and pedagogical 'doing' and 'being' demonstrate how ambiguity of role, non-alignment of values with practice realities and unanticipated disruption of self-representation are variably resolved by individuals. The findings suggest that successfully negotiating identity shifts may be essential for coherent personal and professional narratives, while lack of a collective response to contextual change may explain why academic teacher identity challenges are overlooked at the institutional level. We recommend identification, discussion, and alignment of institutional, professional, and personal pedagogical goals prior to contextual change.",

These stories are well worth our attention. Of course, the comparisons to Maus will be inevitable, as is true for every serious work of graphic narrative written since Spiegelman\u2019s work debuted. But it does this volume an injustice not to take it on its own terms. We\u2019re Still at War vivifies the pain and suffering of these Czech witnesses , from the Second World War through the long Communist era, and provides the reader with historical and emotional insights. Rita D. Jacobs New York City Steven Pinker Enlightenment Now:The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress New York. Viking. 2018. 576 pages. The heart of Steven Pinker\u2019s important new book is in its title: Enlightenment Now. It is a stalwart defense of the ideals of the Enlightenment, recasting them \u201cin the language and concepts of the twenty-first century.\u201d The \u201cNow\u201d in the title and the timing of the book\u2019s publication are by no means coincidental\u2014Enlightenment Now appears both universally applicable as well as acutely relevant in today\u2019s global sociopolitical climate. Pinker divides his book into three parts, using the first to set out what enlightenment is; he identifies humanism\u2014the striving for the flourishing of all humans\u2014 as setting its goal and reason and science as guiding its methodology. In the second part, he embarks on a tour de force through fields as diverse as happiness, war, and knowledge to show how, over the last centuries, humans have evoked Enlightenment ideals to bring about substantial progress in each of them. One of the book\u2019s most impressive features is that Pinker\u2019s arguments are not only made in his usual wit and multitude of cultural and intellectual references but also come with a rather impressive wealth of data and historical trends, be those the global decline in extreme poverty and war or the global increase of life expectancy, knowledge , equality, and happiness. Following the staggering optimism of the book\u2019s second part, Pinker places his defense of Enlightenment ideals in the third, cautioning us that progress will not continue inevitably\u2014it is contingent on the ideals that underlie it. One might view reason, science, and humanism to be self-evident. Sadly, history and current events remind us otherwise. And arguably even more important, our own personal biases might infringe on these ideals much more heavily than we are ready to admit. In an age of rekindling nationalism and xenophobia, a defense of democracy, reason , and science is increasingly necessary. Where \u201c[i]n area after area, the world has been getting more rational, [t]here is . . . a flaming exception: electoral politics and the issues that have clung to it.\u201d Throughout the book, Pinker uncovers patterns and fallacies of human thought, which become particularly relevant in our political tribalism . Both on the left and on the right, we subscribe to ideas and vote not primarily for content but for identity alignment. We tend to quickly forgive the indiscretions of those in our own party while rejecting ideas that we might otherwise endorse, purely based on our party\u2019s position. Public discourse today, particularly in the US, is dominated not only by an ever more divergent dichotomy of positions and methodologies but also by rising negativity and fatalism both from the political left and the right. However, Pinker argues that such a \u201cbleak assessment of the state of the world . . . couldn\u2019t-be-more-wrong,\u201d pointing toward the difference between episodes that shape our perceptions and longer-term trends that frequently directly contradict these perceptions. Some may be critical of the level of optimism that Pinker shows for such momentous issues as climate change or artificial general intelligence. Others have spoken out against the case that Pinker makes about the antireason tendencies of universities and the political left more generally. But regardless of one\u2019s views on such points, Pinker\u2019s Enlightenment Now comes at a crucial time, in which we have to concede that \u201cthe end of history\u201d as proclaimed by Francis Fukuyama in his synonymous...",

We show that these narratives are structured according to the metaphorical framework of the journey, through which actors envision and make sense of personal transformation. The journey provides a valuable metaphor for conceptualizing narrative identities in entrepreneurial careers as individuals navigate different social landscapes, illuminating identities as unfolding through a process of wayfinding in response to events, transitions and turning-points. We delineate the journey from entrepreneurship to philanthropy, and propose a typology of rewards that entrepreneurs claim to derive from giving. We add to the expanding literature on narrative identities by suggesting that philanthropic identity narratives empower wealthy entrepreneurs to generate a legacy of the self that is both self- and socially oriented, these \u2018generativity scripts\u2019 propelling their capacity for action while ensuring the continuation of their journeys.",

It argues that it is legitimate to say that there is such a thing as the self as distinct from the human being, and asks whether a self can suffer loss by death. It criticizes the popular notion of the narrative self, and, more generally, the use of the notion of narrative in ethics and psychology. It considers the first-person pronoun 'I' and a number of puzzles raised by the phenomena of self-reference and self-knowledge. It examines Locke's, Hume's, and Kant's accounts of the mind and personal identity, and argues that Locke and Hume have been badly misunderstood.",

      "abstract": "In Europe, wellbeing in the workplace has increasing prominence in the policy and research agenda and education is a key context in which the challenge of occupational stress has been reported. Traditionally, the ethos in school settings could be said to be shaped by the vocational motivation of employees, that is, a commitment to a social benefit through the development, support and improvement of the pupils and this commitment used to override workplace challenges and help teachers deal with stress. This paper argues that teachers\u2019 commitment is being eroded by the impact of bureaucratic changes at management level, such as the setting of performance targets, increased workload, increased accountability and changes in curriculum. This in turn impacts on their professional identity and can negatively affect their mental health and well being. The current paper describes a qualitative study undertaken among 39 teachers and six school leaders across England and Wales in which we sought to understand, through interviews, the contextual workplace experiences of teachers who experienced work-related stress. Policy developments in education and management implementation of these developments and the consequent erosion of teacher autonomy dominated the narratives. We examine how managerialism can relate to a loss of commitment, professional identity, self-confidence and vulnerability to stress, anxiety and depression. This paper proposes that educational reforms, and the rigidly prescribed organisational and management structures that accompany them, need to be weighed against their impacts on professional identity and personal wellbeing",

Despite the fact that flying can be more damaging than any other activity that an individual can undertake, many otherwise green consumers still choose to fly, offering an opportunity to elicit narratives about the differences between their attitudes and behaviours. Qualitative interview data were gathered from self-selected green consumers and set within a cognitive dissonance analytical framework. Four strategies were uncovered: not changing travel behaviour (but offering justifications related to travel product, travel context or personal identity); reducing or restricting flights; changing other behaviours to compensate for flying; and stopping flying. This analysis furthers research on green consumer rationales for (un)sustainable behaviours and suggests several avenues for sustainable marketing management.",

This is often understood as a question of whether DBS poses a threat to personal identity, which is typically understood as having to do with psychological and/or narrative continuity over time. In this article, we argue that the discussion of whether DBS is a threat to continuity over time is too narrow. There are other questions concerning DBS and the self that are overlooked in discussions exclusively focusing on psychological and/or narrative continuity. For example, it is also important to investigate whether DBS might sometimes have a positive (e.g., a rehabilitating) effect on the patient\u2019s self. To widen the discussion of DBS, so as to make it encompass a broader range of considerations that bear on DBS\u2019s impact on the self, we identify six features of the commonly used concept of a person\u2019s \u201ctrue self.\u201d We apply these six features to the relation between DBS and the self. And we end with a brief discussion of the role DBS might play in treating otherwise treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa. This further highlights the importance of discussing both continuity over time and the notion of the true self.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Speech-language pathologists know much more about children's development of fictional narratives than they do about children's development of personal narratives and the role these personal narratives play in academic success, social\u2013emotional development, and self-regulation. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide clinicians with strategies for assessing and developing children's and adolescents' personal narratives. Method This tutorial reviews the literature on (a) the development of autobiographical event narratives and life stories, (b) factors that contribute to development of these genres, (c) the importance of these genres for the development of sense of self-identity and self-regulation, (d) deficits in personal narrative genres, and (e) strategies for eliciting and assessing event narratives and life stories. Implications To promote development of personal event narratives and life stories, speech-language pathologists can help clients retrieve information about interesting events, provide experiences worthy of narrating, and draw upon published narratives to serve as model texts. Clinicians can also address four interrelated processes in intervention: reminiscing, reflecting, making coherent connections, and signaling the plot structure. Furthermore, they can activate metacognitive awareness of how evaluations of experiences, coherence, and plot structure are signaled in well-formed personal event narratives and life stories.",

      "abstract": "\"In the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity.\" [Erikson, 1968, p. 130]\"The 'methodology of causation' can neither capture the social and personal richness of lives in a culture nor begin to plumb their historical depth. It is only through the application of interpretation that we, as psychologists, can do justice to the world of culture.\" [Bruner, 1990, p. 137]On a hot summer night in Tel Aviv in 2005, a 17-year-old Jewish Israeli named Ayelet1 shared her views on a particularly divisive issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of a life-story interview:As much as I want to understand them [the Palestinians], I can't give up my country. I can't give up Jerusalem. As much as I don't live there and I don't really go to the Wall and everything and don't pray and I'm not that religious. But still it's important for me, for my people.Just one year prior, during our initial life-story interview, Ayelet had passionately argued for the division of Jerusalem in the interest of peace [see Hammack, 2011a]. Now, one year later, and interestingly one year after she has engaged with Palestinians in intergroup dialogue, Ayelet presents a personal narrative subordinate to a collective, master narrative in which the discursive demands of social identity reign supreme. No longer do Ayelet's personal views on Jerusalem matter, for what matters to Ayelet is that her personal narrative aligns with a master narrative of a particular place - Jerusalem - and its significance to the collective. To make meaning of Ayelet's personal narrative, we need to recognize the salience of social identity in the course of human development. And we need to recognize the inherent limits to agency involved in the identity development process - a recognition facilitated by the internalized social speech [Vygotsky, 1978] apparent in her personal narrative.When Ayelet was interviewed in 2005, the dominant ways of thinking about narrative identity tended to emphasize narratives as long-term autobiographical projects which provide a sense of psychological unity and coherence [e.g., McAdams, 2001], or as discourses with which individuals engage in situated interactions [e.g., Bamberg, 2004; see Thorne, 2004]. Ayelet's narrative could be understood through the prism of both these general approaches. On the one hand, at age 17, she was just beginning to \"get a life\" [Habermas & Bluck, 2000] through the initial construction of a life story that could make meaning of her social and political context. Surely shifts over time in narrative content were likely to be part of this psychological project, as she engaged with the \"menu\" of themes available in her cultural setting [McAdams & Pals, 2006]. On the other hand, other portions of her interview revealed the process through which Ayelet came to reverse her position on Jerusalem and to emphasize the demands of social identity over time:[After dialogue], I told my friends what all the Palestinians had said, and they said to me there's no way it could all be true. Like what they said about the checkpoints and \u2026 the injustices, or \u2026 stuff that goes on in the West Bank with the army \u2026 it's just not true. I think they were just exaggerating it.This excerpt from Ayelet's narrative suggests that through interactions with peers after dialogue, she came to change her position on peace, justice, and the Palestinians. These situated interactions served to consolidate allegiance to her ingroup and the \"master narrative\" of a particular place and its collective significance Ayelet perceived as dominant at the time.To make meaning of these types of narratives, it seemed at the time (2005-2006) that the two perspectives on narrative identity development - one that emphasized autobiographical projects and one that emphasized narrative in discursive interaction - called for integration. Just as we needed to put \"the person into social identity\" [Thorne, 2004], we needed to put the social into personal identity. In this theoretical climate, we began to develop our framework of master narrative engagement [see Cohler & Hammack, 2007; Hammack, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011a, b; Hammack & Cohler, 2009].The qualitative, interpretive approach to narrative we applied allowed us to make meaning of these shifts in Ayelet's engagement with, and internalization of, master narratives over time, for it allowed us to not just take Ayelet's personal narrative at \"face value,\" applying a \"hermeneutics of faith\" [Josselson, 2004]. Rather, our interpretive approach allowed us to \"plumb the historical depth\" [Bruner, 1990] of Ayelet's life and to see the way in which her social location as a secular Jewish Israeli narrating a life story at a time of rising religious nationalism created particular pressures to internalize a new master narrative. Consistent with the epistemological underpinnings of narrative psychology [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Cohler, 1982; Polkinghorne, 1988], our interpretive approach allowed us to apply a \"hermeneutics of suspicion\" [Josselson, 2004] in which we could deeply interrogate Ayelet's production of a personal narrative over time. Applying narrative methods not just at the level of the person but also at the level of the culture, documenting not just the discourse of Ayelet's personal narrative but also the multiple discourses that proliferated in her social ecology of development and created multiple master narratives to which she was exposed [Hammack, 2011a], we developed a theory and an approach to the study of narrative, identity, and culture that emphasized the mutual constitution of persons and settings through a process of narrative engagement [Hammack, 2008, 2011a, b].The idea of master narrative engagement was intended to provide an integrative theory of human development, anchored in several long-established social science paradigms, grounded in the idea that persons and settings - selves and societies - are mutually constituted through a dynamic engagement with the symbolic meaning system of language in its storied form. Beyond anchoring perspectives on narrative identity development [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Cohler, 1982; McAdams, 1996, 2001], life course developmental theory [e.g., Elder, 1998], and cultural psychology [e.g., Shweder, 1990], theoretical inspirations for the framework included Eriksonian identity theory [e.g., Erikson, 1959], cultural-historical activity theory [CHAT; e.g., Vygotsky, 1978], symbolic interactionism [e.g., Mead, 1934], social identity theory [Tajfel & Turner, 1986], and Foucault's theory of discourse and subjectivity [e.g., Foucault, 1978, 1982]. This theoretical anchoring allowed us to moderate the historical emphasis on personal agency in some theories of narrative and identity [e.g., McAdams, 2001] with perspectives that emphasized the power of social structures and the social categorization process to shape individual subjectivity [e.g., Foucault, 1978; Tajfel & Turner, 1986]. Cultural psychology's thesis of mutual constitution through linguistic mediation [e.g., Bakhtin, 1981; Vygotsky, 1978], as well as symbolic interactionism's thesis of self-development through social interaction and the \"conversation of gestures\" [Mead, 1934], provided us with a dynamic way of theorizing the link among narrative, identity, and culture [see Hammack & Toolis, 2015].Over time, the framework of master narrative engagement has come to infuse all of our empirical work, guiding us toward diverse areas of inquiry, united in the fundamental premise that it is through a dynamic engagement with master narratives that both individual and societal/cultural development proceed [Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. In other words, we saw the idea of master narrative engagement as providing not just a framework for thinking about individual lives but also as a framework for thinking about social change. The reproduction or repudiation of master narratives in the course of development was conceived as the empirical window into the trajectory of an individual, a group, a society [e.g., Hammack, 2008, 2011a]. In the language of Kuhn [1962], the idea of the master narrative became the paradigm through which we viewed our own scientific enterprise, and we hoped to stimulate others to see the value in this concept. In the language of Sarbin [1986], following Pepper [1942], we saw the master narrative as a root metaphor for not just psychological and developmental science, but for social science more broadly [Hammack & Pilecki, 2012].Thus it is with great enthusiasm that we comment upon the framework proposed here by McLean and Syed [this issue] - a framework that we are gratified to say has been heavily influenced by our ideas, as well as many others in the broader field of narrative psychology. In the remainder of this commentary, we highlight points of overlap and distinction between the two frameworks. First, we suggest that, although the master narrative concept and underlying theory proposed by McLean and Syed overlaps considerably with our theory of master narrative engagement, they offer a valuable elaboration and extension that we suspect will be enormously useful to the field. They imbue the master narrative concept we and others have discussed at length with more specificity and precision, and hence McLean and Syed's framework is likely to be highly generative of new empirical work that can make use of their taxonomic system. As part of our discussion of conceptual overlap and distinction, we clarify the emphasis on structural constraint over agency in our own framework. We highlight the key distinction between frameworks in a discussion of interpretive versus post-positivist epistemologies to the study of narrative identity development. We conclude by returning to the idea of the master narrative as root metaphor for psychological and developmental science.McLean and Syed suggest that the term \"master narrative\" has been used in multiple and perhaps inconsistent ways in the literature, and they seek to offer \"a clear set of principles that define what master narratives are\" and \"an articulation of the different types of master narratives.\" When we began to use the term \"master narrative\" to describe stories of collective history and identity young Israelis and Palestinians seemed to be appropriating in their personal narratives [Hammack, 2006], we were inspired not only by psychological and developmental scientists [e.g., Bamberg, 2004; Thorne & McLean, 2003] but also by historians, sociologists, and other social scientists who were speaking of narrative (though not necessarily using the term \"master\") in a similar vein [e.g., Somers, 1994; Suny, 2001]. As it had been deployed at the time, master narratives were chiefly about social categories such as gender. Bamberg [2004], for example, viewed master narratives as \"preexisting normative discourses\" (p. 331). The most important feature here lay precisely in the term master: these are compulsory discourses - storied language that individuals feel compelled to internalize and reproduce to maintain a particular social order. That idea resonated very strongly with the narrative data young Israelis and Palestinians were providing, though the narratives they seemed to be appropriating were not just about a social category; they contained prescriptive elements about the form a life story should take, as well as about events and places (e.g., Jerusalem) significant to the group.As we began to use the term in our own empirical work and to think more theoretically about the relationship between personal and master narratives, we also saw the lack of a clear definition of the concept, in spite of its intuitive appeal. We first defined a master narrative as a \"cultural script or 'dominant discourse' that proliferates in a society\" [Hammack, 2009, p. 51]. Inspired by Thorne and McLean [2003] and Bamberg [2004], we thought of master narratives as not just about historical events or collective memories but also about the basic meaning of social categories: \"[Master narratives are] dominant scripts which can be identified in cultural products and discourse (e.g., media, literature, film, textbooks). These scripts contain collective storylines that range from a group's history to notions of what it means to inhabit a particular social category\" [Hammack, 2010, p. 178]. In this definition, we expressed precision in precisely where to look for master narratives in empirical work (i.e., cultural products or artifacts and discourse), and we implicitly provided our own typology: master narratives are about events (i.e., history) and groups (i.e., social identities).McLean and Syed define master narratives as \"culturally shared stories that tell us about a given culture, and provide guidance for how to be a 'good' member of a culture; they are a part of the structure of society.\" Here we find overlap between our own definition of master narrative and theirs, though our definition is perhaps more limiting (even if more precise in terms of guiding empirical inquiry) in its emphasis on history and social identity. They usefully make explicit in their definition the prescriptive nature of master narratives, suggesting that internalization of the master narrative brings with it social value for the \"good\" life. On issues of basic definition, though, the idea of master narrative within McLean and Syed's framework is consistent with prior conceptions.The novelty and conceptual innovation in McLean and Syed's framework emerges in the extraordinarily useful set of principles and the taxonomy for master narratives they posit. The theoretical innovation of their framework lies here because it offers a new account of how and why individuals may internalize or reject - reproduce or resist - narratives in the course of development. They offer a useful elaboration on the compulsory nature of master narratives, as well as their utility, ubiquity, and rigidity. These are essential \"properties\" of master narratives that have gone unarticulated in the literature but that help us to develop parameters of what we might expect as we study narrative identity development.The further generativity - perhaps the most generative aspect - in McLean and Syed's framework lies in the typology or taxonomy of master narratives they propose. As we have noted, master narratives have typically been posited in the domains of history (i.e., events) and social identity (i.e., groups), but McLean and Syed rightly note that there are other domains and other ways of thinking about the classification of master narratives. The particular way of telling a life story is itself a master narrative, as they suggest in their notion of the \"biographical\" master narrative. Our analysis of the formal properties of Israeli and Palestinian life stories revealed to us not just the historical or identity-based content these young people were internalizing but also the very way a life ought to be told in these distinct societies [Hammack, 2006, 2011a]. For example, we found that Palestinians almost universally constructed contaminated or tragic life stories, whereas Jewish Israelis constructed redemptive life stories [using the taxonomic system developed by McAdams & Bowman, 2001]. These life-story forms, we argued, were directly connected to collective expectations of what constitutes a \"good\" autobiography, consistent largely with the political aims of the group [Hammack, 2011a]. McLean and Syed's framework would have been quite useful for us to consider the different elements of master narratives these young people were internalizing and reproducing. No doubt it will provide an invaluable heuristic for future research on narrative and identity.Interestingly, McLean and Syed subsume what we might call the social-categorical master narrative (i.e., the expected storyline about the meaning of a particular social category or social identity) within the biographical master narrative, suggesting that diversity in how biographical narratives are constructed depends upon various social categories, offering the examples of women, Black Americans, and sexual minorities in the United States. We prefer to think of these types of master narratives as their own distinct \"kind,\" chiefly because we place great emphasis on the process of social categorization and its implications for human development in all of our work [e.g., Pilecki & Hammack, 2014; Toolis & Hammack, 2015]. In our view, subsuming the social-categorical master narrative within the biographical privileges personal identity by suggesting that individual cognition about the life story precedes consideration of social cognition. We come from a position that, as the title of this commentary suggests, privileges the significance of social categorization and its impact on human development. Hence we prefer to think of these different \"types\" of master narratives \"on the same metric\" (to borrow a phrase from McLean and Syed). Regardless, we suspect that the basic typology for master narratives McLean and Syed propose will prove remarkably generative for the field, even as it may be adapted or elaborated by future researchers.The general concept of the master narrative thus overlaps between McLean and Syed's framework and our own, but they have offered an invaluable elaboration and expansion in their articulation of a set of principles that define master narratives and a typology for classifying different kinds of master narratives. The assumptions and basic premises between the two frameworks, we suggest, are also overlapping. In other words, the theory at the root of their framework is consistent with the premises of master narrative engagement.In another point of convergence, McLean and Syed propose a vision of identity development \"that attends to both the individual as well as the cultural structures in which the individual develops and, importantly, captures the dynamics of that relationship.\" Inspired chiefly by Erikson [1959, 1968], they propose a framework of identity as the conceptual link between self and society.We propose that the concept of master narratives provides a framework for understanding the nature of this intersection between self and society \u2026 As individuals construct a personal narrative, they negotiate with and internalize these master narratives - they are the material they have to work with to understand how to live a good life.For McLean and Syed, the master narrative concept represents the ideal prism through which to interrogate the self-society link, and they emphasize the importance of thinking of narrative not as \"product\" but also as \"process.\"In these core claims about their framework, we find strong echoes of our theory of master narrative engagement, the central tenet of which is that human development is characterized by a dynamic process through which individuals and societies negotiate the meaning of lives, events, and groups through an engagement with narratives [e.g., Hammack, 2008, 2010, 2011a, b]. We described identity as\u2026 ideology cognized through the individual engagement with discourse, made manifest in a personal narrative constructed and reconstructed across the life course and scripted in and through social interaction and social practice. In this way, the content of identity is inherently ideological, assuming a narrative structure and realized in and through social experience. [Hammack, 2008, p. 230]Here we were inspired by Erikson [1959, 1968] to think about master narratives as conveying an ideology - a system of beliefs about the world that says something about one's social and political location [see also McAdams, 2001]. This terminological distinction hints at an important addendum to theories of narrative and identity we made early on and have continuously made over the course of our research: narratives are not \"neutral\" but assume an ideological position with implications for the social order. Identity is both process (it is made through social practice) and product (it is codified in the personal narrative that integrates the discourse of master narratives), but identities are always constructed from social and political locations [Hammack, 2008; Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. Consistent with social identity theory, we argue that the identity development process fundamentally involves a competition of value-laden discourses with implications for power and status at both the individual and collective levels [Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. Hence whether a young Jewish Israeli appropriates the discourse of united (the dominant perspective) versus divided (the perspective) Jerusalem has significant implications for the social location of the with the in she for a divided Jerusalem and with the more dominant or she for Our point here is that identity development is a deeply social and political process and product of human development, and our framework precisely to the field of narrative and identity with a that the social and core part of our theory of identity, and a point of from perspectives in psychological and developmental science at the time, was the notion that individuals are fundamentally in the course of narrative identity development. We to dominant perspectives that implicitly or the largely a life story from available and to at will what may the \"good\" life [e.g., McAdams & Pals, 2006].

      "abstract": "Scholarship on Syria has traditionally been limited by researchers' difficulty in accessing the reflections of ordinary citizens due to their reluctance to speak about politics. The 2011 revolt opened exciting opportunities by producing an outpouring of new forms of self-expression, as well as encouraging millions to tell their stories for the first time. I explore what we can learn from greater attention to such data, based on thick descriptive analysis of original interviews with 200 Syrian refugees. I find that individuals' narratives coalesce into a collective narrative emphasizing shifts in political fear. Before the uprising, fear was a pillar of the state's coercive authority. Popular demonstrations generated a new experience of fear as a personal barrier to be surmounted. As rebellion militarized into war, fear became a semi-normalized way of life. Finally, protracted violence has produced nebulous fears of an uncertain future. Study of these testimonials aids understanding of Syria and other cases of destabilized authoritarianism by elucidating lived experiences obscured during a repressive past, providing a fresh window into the construction and evolution of national identity, and demonstrating how the act of narration is an exercise in meaning making within a revolution and itself a revolutionary practice.",

But what we know about how called professionals construct identities as people who are called to their work is incomplete. Discussions about callings are often framed as narratives\u2014stories of people\u2019s callings\u2014yet little is known about how professionals incorporate a wide variety of life events into coherent stories that support their identity claims. To understand this process, we analyzed the narratives of 236 individuals from four professions. We found two ways our participants identified their callings: discernment and exploration. Discerners journeyed toward their destiny, which was their one true calling. Explorers actively searched for work they loved, but destiny played no role. Through a series of lived experiences, called professionals\u2019 identities took shape as they were enacted, with their callings strengthening over time. After identifying their calling, each of these professionals engaged in two crucial processes for integrating self and work as they lived their calling. Like other professionals, called professionals sought legitimacy in their fields by demonstrating mastery and receiving affirmation. Yet their sense of calling simultaneously propelled them to craft personal authenticity through tailoring their own unique enactment of the role.",

Factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and/or violence exposure may heighten normal youth challenges and affect identity development. Narrative tools that help minority adolescents produce agentic, coherent, affective, and adaptive self-concepts contribute to a proactive identity system and, therefore, an enhanced capacity for them to intervene in their own lives. The purpose of the afterschool digital storytelling group was for youth to gain opportunities in media production and in personal story construction. As a result, youth gained a valuable narrative medium for constructing their stories, and thus their identities, into ones of possibility, promise, and potential. Implications for helping professionals include how to use digital storytelling with youth to gain insight and understanding into a personally difficult life event.",

It employs autobiography as a research method to portray the reshaping of ourselves as doctoral students to help us engage in self-reflexivity on our mediation of academic, personal and cultural identities in international doctoral education. Our self-narratives on how the plurality of our doctoral identities has emerged and how we have mediated these multiple identities show that becoming an intercultural research student is intimately linked to the process of self-empowerment and re-construction of oneself as a flexible and reflexive intercultural learner and human being. The paper concludes by discussing the notion of 'reciprocal intercultural supervision' in doctoral education. It highlights the increased need for (Western) supervisors to develop reciprocal interculturality and the capacity for greater agency in their international doctoral students so that both groups can understand each other better.",
