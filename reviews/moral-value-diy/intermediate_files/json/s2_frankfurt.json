I argue that although Frankfurt is right in saying that the mere act of caring is already valuable, that is not enough for a meaningful praxis. Given that our ends in life determine our choices, whatever we love will determine the kind of life we have, and different kinds of life are not equally valuable. K e y w o r d s Harry Frankfurt, what we care about, identity, morality, practical reason. * Agradezco a Conicyt, proyecto Fondecyt 1170260, por el apoyo en la escritura de este art\u00edculo.",

Frankfurt defenders have primarily focused on trying to show that the alternative possibility of refraining from making the relevant decisions on their own is not a robust alternative, while generally granting that this alternative cannot easily be eliminated from successful cases of this sort. In a recent issue of this journal, Stockdale ( 2022 ) attempts to sidestep the debate concerning robustness and develops a novel kind of Frankfurt-style case in which agents are unable to avoid making the relevant decisions on their own. The fundamental problem with Stockdale\u2019s argument is that it hinges on an implausible conception of acting on one\u2019s own. I help clarify the pertinent sense of what it means to do a thing on one\u2019s own in this context and show that these new cases are unable to overcome the targeted versions of the flicker defense of PAP.",

This structural account of the will, this chapter argues, fails to engage with the dynamics of will, resulting in two shortcomings: (1) the problem of directionality, or that Frankfurtian freedom obtains whenever first- and second-order volitions align, regardless of which desire was made to change, and (2) the potential for infinite regress of higher-order desires. The authors propose that a satisfying account of the genesis of second-order volitions can resolve these issues. To provide this they draw from George Ainslie\u2019s mechanistic account of self-control, which relies on intertemporal bargaining wherein an individual\u2019s self-predictions about future decisions affect the value of her current choices. They suggest that second-order volitions emerge from precisely this sort of process, and that a Frankfurt-Ainslie account of free will avoids the objections previously raised.",

It explores the origins, significance, and development of the concept, linking it to postmodern philosophy and comparative studies with the Frankfurt School. The analysis also includes J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Axel Honneth\u2019s views on recognition in the virtual world.\nMethod: The paper follows an analytical approach by examining Habermas and Honneth\u2019s perspectives on recognition in the virtual realm, using secondary data and literature reviews.\nResults: The study highlights the importance of recognition in virtual spaces, demonstrating that these environments enable participation and expression, expanding the scope of recognition within virtual interactions. The virtual world offers individuals greater opportunities for self-expression and identity formation.\nConclusions: The study emphasizes the role of society as a broad communicative environment, in line with Frankfurt School philosophers. It also underscores that the virtual space functions as a human environment that empowers individuals, enhancing their participation. Using technology for decision-making and expression broadens the application of recognition to include the virtual realm.",

This dialectic consists in the transformation of individualization as a medium of emancipation into individualization understood not only as an ideology but most of all as a productive force of neoliberal capitalism, as a principle of its functioning. The article discusses the social-cultural determinants of this transformation, and subsequently the way in which late-modern individualism in the form of self-realization is functionalized by the market and subjected to the requirements of profit and efficiency in individual areas of economic and social life in the neoliberal world. The article refers to the methodology of qualitative sociology.",

      "abstract": "This essay argues for a new conception of bad faith based partly on Harry Frankfurt's famous account of personal autonomy in terms of higher\u2010order volitions and caring, and based partly on Sartre's insights concerning tacit or pre\u2010thetic attitudes and \u201ctranscendent\u201d freedom. Although Sartre and Frankfurt have rarely been connected, Frankfurt's concepts of volitional \u201cwantonness\u201d and \u201cbullshit\u201d (wantonness about truth) are similar in certain revealing respects to Sartre's account of bad faith. However, Sartre leaves no room for Frankfurt's central point that people can volitionally commit themselves to develop certain motives and reduce others, thereby shaping an authentic identity through volitional \u201cidentification\u201d and \u201calienation\u201d of motives. Frankfurt in turn minimizes the role that a sense of liberty to form and alter higher\u2010order volitions plays in experiences of autonomy, which Sartre recognizes in the transcendence of the \u201cfor\u2010itself.\u201d When these points are combined, we get a tri\u2010level theory of intrasubjective volitional stances that explains Sartre's cases better than his own theory can, and also clarifies how sincere or procedurally autonomous self\u2010relation is possible.",

Engaging with the work of Audre Lorde and James C. Scott, I argue how discounting self-care as insignificant or co-opted masks the possibilities for everyday forms of resistance through self-care. Broadening beyond a focus on simplistic binaries\u2014individual versus collective, co-opted versus radical\u2014this article offers a different orientation toward self-care\u2014one that I call critical self-care\u2014which recognizes that we can be critical of co-optation by the university, while also understanding self-care as critical to our existence within the university. I develop this conceptualization of self-care in the context of the neoliberal university, by identifying three facets of critical self-care\u2014disruption of the hegemonic academic culture of overwork, building alternative ways of existing within the university, and allowing for the self-care of others\u2014each of which reveals how self-care practices hold the potential for resistance and change to gendered and racialized norms of the institution, even in quiet or informal ways.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Neoliberal conditions in academia often preclude space for ongoing processes of collective reflection and growth, particularly for women faculty. In this qualitative self-study, three women faculty members examine working outside the lines of neoliberal institutions and theoretical traditions to nurture onto-epistemological development through a reading group that has now spanned two years. Drawing on critical feminist posthuman lenses, we inquired into the ways in which we worked and talked through challenging philosophical and theoretical texts in community and connected to our everyday experience as researchers/instructors in ongoing conversations. Specifically, we asked: What opportunities were presented through this different approach to reading and thinking together? What connections to practice and scholarship were created? How did these inform our ways of knowing and being? Our analysis of reflections and meeting notes demonstrates the ways our work \u2018outside the lines\u2019 allowed us to do academia differently, in big and small ways \u2013 helping us disrupt the isolation and competition of the academy by developing an immanent and relational orientation, working to decenter our (white) selves, and folding our complexifying understandings into research and teaching praxis. Ultimately, we recognize our \u2018working outside the lines\u2019 as a form of productive resistance to the devastating effects of neoliberal capitalism, a form of affirmative ethics of care connecting into a larger movement of creating a more relational, supportive academia.",
