      "abstract": "As a typical symptom of digital capitalism, digital labor alienation perpetuates the logic of alienation revealed by Marx while forming a more concealed exploitation system through data monopoly, algorithmic control, and platform hegemony. Analyzing the dual character of digital labor commodities and its new forms of alienation based on the labor theory of value reveals that capital achieves comprehensive domination over the labor process through technological empowerment, causing laborers to lose their subjectivity under the illusion of free labor. To sublate this alienation, practical efforts must unfold across three dimensions: promoting open-source technology and data commonization to dismantle capital's monopoly of the means of production, breaking platform discursive hegemony to reconstruct the cultural ecology of labor, and awakening the class consciousness of the digital proletariat to transform them from technological objects into historical subjects. This path of liberation constitutes both a contemporary development of Marx's theory of alienation and reveals the socialized potential of digital technologyonly when algorithms and data return to the community of laborers can digital labor achieve its essential return from a means of livelihoodto a free conscious activity,opening new historical possibilities for the comprehensive development of the person.",

With the development of private ownership, labor shifts from being special to general and, upon contact with capital, becomes alienated abstract labor. Marx, through his critique of abstract labor, demonstrates from historical, social, and subjective dimensions that the subjective essence of wealth is the realization of human needs, abilities, and creativity through free and conscious labor under the conditions of the abolition of private property. This provides a solid theoretical foundation for critiquing the alienation of digital labor in digital capitalism, such as the historical continuation of abstraction, the algorithmic restructuring of labor-capital relations, and the obscuring of labor subjectivity and emotions.",

      "abstract": "Against the backdrop of rapidly developing industrialization and digitalization, the relationship between the meaning of labor and human subjectivity has once again become a focal point of social concern. Using Marx's theory of \"labor alienation\" as its core analytical framework, this article examines the manifestations and mechanisms of the \"alienation---de-alienation---re-alienation\" cycle between industrial production and traditional handicrafts, drawing on four case studies: smartphone manufacturing, Jingdezhen porcelain, Suzhou embroidery, and Zhangqiu iron woks. Employing qualitative comparative analysis, the study, through textual analysis and literature review, reveals the tensions between people, labor, and creativity across different forms of labor. The findings suggest that industrialized production, centered on efficiency and the logic of capital, leads to the comprehensive alienation of workers at the levels of product, process, self, and social relations. On the other hand, handicrafts, through control over the entire production process and emotional engagement, achieve a certain degree of restoration of human subjectivity. However, marketization and technological intervention may also trigger new forms of \"re-alienation,\" particularly in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), where algorithmic production poses a potential risk of \"creation without human touch.\" This article points out that in the future we should advocate \"using technology to counter alienation\" through digital intangible cultural heritage education, virtual exhibitions and cultural innovation.",

Over a century later, Herbert Marcuse, building on Marx\u2019s theory of alienated labor and responding to new developments in capitalism, proposes the concept of\u00a0technological alienation. He argues that science and technology have evolved into novel forms of social control. While Marcuse\u2019s theory of technological alienation inherits Marx\u2019s framework, significant divergences inevitably emerge due to the century-long gap between their historical contexts and the distinct socio-economic realities they addressed.",

Marx linked human labor with alienation, and took \"labor alienation\" as his conceptual analysis tool, constructed the analytical framework of political economy criticism, and then opened up a way to sublate alienation. On the basis of inheriting and reflecting on Marx's alienation thought, Simmel focuses on the contradiction and conflict between the subject content and the object form by explaining the social and cultural significance of money, and then examines the pessimistic picture of the whole human society under modernity. In fact, Marx and Simmel constructed their modernity analysis framework through different critical orientations.",

      "abstract": "The theory of \"alienated labor\" is a crucial component of Marx's \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\". It also provides strong support for analyzing the poverty of workers under the capitalist mode of production. Marx made extensive discussions on \"alienated labor\", constructed a relatively complete conceptual system, and systematically analyzed the fourfold determination of alienated labor as the primary content. On the basis of analyzing the fourfold determination, exploring the hidden relationship between alienated labor and private property, and seeking practical ways to eliminate alienated labor are the key to truly grasping Marx's theory of alienated labor. This theory is not only a major theoretical achievement of Marx's criticism of bourgeois political economy, but also an important breakthrough for the formation of his historical materialism. It can be said that the issue of alienation plays a connecting role in Marxism, especially in Marxist political economy. Considering the current development of China's economy and society in the context of the new era, the new development concept implemented in the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics embodies the practical significance and guiding value of Marx's theory of alienated labor: promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for man and nature through innovative development and green development; advancing the building of harmonious labor relations through shared development and open development; and facilitating the free and all-round development of human beings through coordinated development.",

According to the logic of dialectical materialism, the economic base of the capitalist mode of production is determined by a historical dialectic (alienated labor) that produces an unsolvable contradiction with the capitalist imperatives of the superstructure. The alienation of the workers is perpetuated through their active subordination to the ideal and material power of the capitalist superstructure (including its ideal \u201claw of value\u201d which postulates the domination of exchange value over use value). They are led to believe that the profit-embedded prices of the commodities they produce have nothing to do with them. The illusion is that these prices are decided by an abstract \u201cfree market.\u201d In reality, the laborers, due to their alienation, contribute directly to the formation of these prices by allowing the capitalists to freely compete with each other by lowering their respective \u201cprice of production.\u201d There can be no profitable prices under capitalism without the contradictory condition of alienation perpetuated by the ideal power of the superstructure.",

The relationship between man and man, man and society in the traditional mode of division of labor has been broken, and the pattern of division of labor between manual workers and mental workers has also changed, and its boundaries are no longer clear. In spite of this, Marx\u2019s social division of labor theory in the context of artificial intelligence has not lost its rationality, on the contrary, it is increasingly clear in the questioning and challenge. Human labor has not been devalued because of the rise of artificial intelligence, and living labor is still the only source of value creation; artificial intelligence also cannot change the fact that workers are exploited by capital, and the elimination of private property is the only way to achieve human liberation.",

Marx's critical thought of ecological aesthetics still inspires us how to become a better aesthetic \"class subject\": In the direction change of the body, we should change from \"body slavery\" to \"body freedom\"; In the transformation of world thought, we should change from \"anthropocentrism\" to \"non-anthropocentrism\".

This interpretation is based, I claim, on a (mis)reading which consists in a rather systematic blurring of the distinction between labor as a universal and irreducible human activity and labor in its historically determined capitalist form, which is the object of Marx's critique, i.e., alienated labor. Following that, I discuss Weil's construal of labor and I shed light on its affinities with the Marxian problematic. My aim is to show that Arendt's comment does not do justice to the problems that Weil addresses both with and beyond Marx.",
