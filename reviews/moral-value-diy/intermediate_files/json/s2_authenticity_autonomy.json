      "abstract": "An ongoing debate between \u2018procedural\u2019 and \u2018substantive\u2019 theorists of personal autonomy addresses the following question: should agents have the final say on their own autonomy or should the objective circumstances in which agents live take prevalence when assessing their autonomy? Proceduralists favour the first strategy and substantive theorists restrict more explicitly the conditions under which autonomy is possible. I focus on forms of heteronomy which derive from oppressive circumstances and accept that substantive theorists are correct in contending that (i) forms of oppression common in contemporary liberal societies (e.g. gender or racial oppression) tend to increase heteronomy; and (ii) the heteronomy which derives from social oppression tends to fly below the radar of procedural accounts. Still, I argue that a revised procedural strategy could limit these forms of heteronomy as long as it avoids the injunctions to \u2018authenticity\u2019 common in procedural models. I proceed by reconstructing John Christman\u2019s model which, I argue, constitutes the most promising procedural account to assess autonomy under oppression. Christman\u2019s theory, however, needs to be reinforced to ensure self-problematisation in light of a social perspective. I show that the latter is necessary to experience the forms of alienation which are markers of heteronomy according to Christman.",

Regarding (1), I argue that the pattern theory of self (PTS) can be regarded as such a framework. In realizing (2) and (3), I indicate that most relevant issues concerning PTS that require resolutions are ontological issues, including the persistence question, the \u201cspecificity problem\u201d, and finding lacking relevant aspects of the self. In realizing (4), I identify aspects of the self not included in PTS which are desperately needed to investigate the full range of potentially relevant DBS-induced changes\u2014authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility, and conclude that how we define authenticity will have implications for our concept of autonomy, which in turn will determine how we think about responsibility. Concerning (5), I discuss a complex relation between moral aspects and PTS\u2014on one hand, they serve as the lens through which a particular self-pattern can be evaluated; on the other, they are, themselves, products of dynamical interactions of various self-aspects. Finally, I discuss (6), demonstrating novel way of understanding the effects of DBS on patients\u2019 selves.",

Sufferers do not appear to be making autonomous decisions, and appear to be severely impaired in their decision\u2010making capacity. Suffers of these kinds of cases of these kinds of disorders fall into a \u201cgray area\u201d in the law. If this gray area is to be avoided, the law requires clearer criteria for determining how affect can undermine autonomy. Existing \u201cprocedural\u201d accounts of autonomy that explicitly set out to deal with how affective states can undermine decision\u2010making are unable to deal with a clinically significant class of such cases. In this class of cases, autonomy is undermined by an affective state that is relevantly coherent with the rest of the person's affective states and attitudes, and has relevantly inoffensive origins. The relevant affective state nevertheless appears to \u201chijack\u201d the person, and to rule over them \u201ctyrannically.\u201d I argue for a necessary condition on autonomy amenable to a procedural account,\n non\u2010tyranny\n , according to which one is autonomous with respect to a decision only if one has the ability to resist the influence of any given affective state on that decision.\n",

      "abstract": "This paper explores the agency of marginalized individuals navigating negative social scripts, arguing that such scripts threaten autonomy and authenticity by acting as external guiding principles that do not reflect the individual's self-conception. I call agents that navigate these social scripts double agents because they are constituted by double consciousness \u2013 an acute awareness of how they are perceived by others. This awareness leads double agents to endorse a new guiding principle that tells them to use social scripts strategically. This preserves autonomy and authenticity by allowing the agent to be guided by a principle she endorses and perform actions she believes reflect her self-conception. However, one aspect of authenticity, otherauthenticity, is undermined as others fail to recognize double agents as the agents they are. This highlights the harms of marginalization and social scripts as double agents risk becoming alienated from their own self-conception and contributing to their own marginalization.",

When our actions retain the remaining authentic features in a threatened population we should allow such a diminishment as authenticity can bereclaimed in time.",

DBS brings therapeutic benefits, but can also have adverse side effects.

This article provides a review of the neuroethical literature examining this issue, and identifies the crucial dimensions related to the self which DBS may endanger\u2014personal identity, authenticity, and autonomy. The most influential theories accounting for these dimensions are analyzed herein, and it is argued that most of these theories require further refinement.

I will explore several ways in which biomedical enhancement may improve the autonomy of moral agents and try to show that biomedical methods are, all things considered, beneficial to our autonomy and authenticity. I will argue that there are instances when it\u2019s desirable to limit the autonomy of moral agents and that strict regulations are to be put in place if a great number of people will have easy access to powerful, genetic-altering technologies which can impact the life of future children. I will advocate for using assisted reproductive technologies in order to select the child with the best chance of the best moral life and in doing so I will analyse several procreative principles which have been proposed by different scholars in the genetic enhancement debate and try to determine which one would be best to adhere to. Usually, people place high value on the concept of autonomy and there are many cases in which they end up overestimating autonomy in relation to other moral values. While autonomy is important, it\u2019s also important to know how to limit it when reasonable societal norms require it. Sometimes autonomy is defined in strong connection with the concept of authenticity, in the sense that it\u2019s not sufficient for our choices to be autonomous if they are not also authentic. I will try to defend the idea that authenticity can be enhanced as well with the aid of enhancement technologies which can actually prove beneficial in our quest to improve our own self.",

In this paper, we investigate the concept of authenticity and associated conceptions of the self. We develop a conception of authenticity that eschews problematic essentialist or existentialist views of the self and the assumption that the authentic self transcends socialization. In our view, authenticity is a condition for self-governance and can involve either endorsement or acknowledgment. Revisiting the debate about neurotechnologies, we show why framing the ethical debate in terms of authenticity is unhelpful and argue that these ethical concerns are better understood as concerns about autonomy.",

      "abstract": "Respect for autonomy is a central moral principle in bioethics. The concept of autonomy can be construed in various ways. Under the non-ideal conceptualization proposed by Beauchamp and Childress, everyday choices of generally competent persons are autonomous to the extent that they are intentional and are made with understanding and without controlling influences. It is sometimes suggested that authenticity is important to personal autonomy, so that inauthenticity prevents otherwise autonomous persons from making autonomous decisions. Building from Beauchamp and Childress\u2019s theory, this article develops a non-ideal authenticity-based conceptualization of personal autonomy. Factors that indicate inauthentic decision-making are explicated, and the full concept is defended from three expected objections. The theory is then tested on a paradigm case which has concerned theorists and practitioners for some time, namely the possible inauthenticity of anorexia nervosa patients\u2019 decision-making. It is concluded that the theory seems to be fruitful in analyses of the degree of autonomy of patients\u2019 decision-making, and that it succeeds in providing reliable action-guidance in practical contexts.",
