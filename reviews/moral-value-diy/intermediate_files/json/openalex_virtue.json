      "abstract": "The development of good character in Islam is mostly a process of dealing with one\u2019s emotions. It helps to build and support positive or good emotions or virtues and to fight and suppress negative emotions. Character building would therefore, have much to do with patience and perseverance in controlling emotions leading to negative aspects and reinforcement of emotions leading to positive ethics. Manipulation of emotions lead to good ethics would also guide one to have a spiritually and psychologically healthy life. This research aims at investigating the relationship between new approach in psychology namely, positive psychology which emphasised the positive aspects of emotions and the age old values of virtue ethics. This conceptual study concludes that the integration of virtue ethics and some aspects of modern Psychology which are in harmony with the worldview, ethical principles, ethical values and norms of Islam not only can be sources of action guides and but also serve as effective methods of management of emotions that steer to self-development and interpersonal relationship skills.",

      "abstract": "This book discusses Aristotle\u2019s biological views about character and the importance of what he calls \u201cnatural character traits\u201d for the development of moral virtue as presented in his ethical treatises. It provides a new, comprehensive account of the physiological underpinnings of moral development and thereby shows, first, that Aristotle\u2019s ethical theories do not exhaust his views about character, as has traditionally been assumed, and, second, that his treatment of natural character in the biological treatises provides the conceptual and ideological foundation for his views about habituation as developed in his ethics. This manuscript thus takes seriously Aristotle\u2019s claim\u2014often ignored\u2014that nature is one of the factors through which men become \u201cgood and capable of fine deeds.\u201d Part I (\u201cThe Physiology and Science of Natural Character\u201d) analyzes, in three chapters, Aristotle\u2019s notion of natural character as it is developed in the biological treatises and its role in moral development, especially as it affects women and certain \u201cbarbarians\u201d\u2014groups who are typically left out of accounts of Aristotle\u2019s ethics. I also discuss its relevance for our understanding of physiognomical ideas in Aristotle. Part II (\u201cThe Physiology of Moral Development\u201d) explores the psychophysical changes in body and soul that one is required to undergo in the process of acquiring moral virtues. It includes a discussion of Aristotle\u2019s eugenic views, his identification of habituation as a form of human perfection, and his claims about the moral deficiencies of women that link them to his beliefs about their biological imperfections.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Recent debate over the empirical psychological presuppositions of virtue ethics has focused on reactive behavioural dispositions. But there are many character traits that cannot be understood properly in this way. Such traits are well described by attitude psychology. Moreover, the findings of attitude psychology support virtue ethics in three ways. First, they confirm the role of habituation in the development of character. Further, they show virtue ethics to be compatible with the situation manipulation experiments at the heart of the recent debate. Finally, they show how the cognitive\u2010affective theory of personality and the two\u2010system theory of behavioural cognition are compatible, thereby undermining the current empirical challenge to virtue ethics. Empirical research into the nature and development of attitudes should therefore be central to philosophical discussions of virtue and character.",

      "abstract": "The 21st century offers a dizzying array of new technological developments: robots smart enough to take white collar jobs, social media tools that manage our most important relationships, ordinary objects that track, record, analyze and share every detail of our daily lives, and biomedical techniques with the potential to transform and enhance human minds and bodies to an unprecedented degree. Emerging technologies are reshaping our habits, practices, institutions, cultures and environments in increasingly rapid, complex and unpredictable ways that create profound risks and opportunities for human flourishing on a global scale. How can our future be protected in such challenging and uncertain conditions? How can we possibly improve the chances that the human family will not only live, but live well, into the 21st century and beyond? This book locates a key to that future in the distant past: specifically, in the philosophical traditions of virtue ethics developed by classical thinkers from Aristotle and Confucius to the Buddha. Each developed a way of seeking the good life that equips human beings with the moral and intellectual character to flourish even in the most unpredictable, complex and unstable situations--precisely where we find ourselves today. Through an examination of the many risks and opportunities presented by rapidly changing technosocial conditions, Vallor makes the case that if we are to have any real hope of securing a future worth wanting, then we will need more than just better technologies. We will also need better humans. Technology and the Virtues develops a practical framework for seeking that goal by means of the deliberate cultivation of technomoral virtues: specific skills and strengths of character, adapted to the unique challenges of 21st century life, that offer the human family our best chance of learning to live wisely and well with emerging technologies.",

In recent times there has been a dawning realization that there has to be a corresponding development in virtue ethics. Developmental virtue ethics as understood in the chapter recognizes the continuous development of humans throughout their various stages of maturation and decline, and conceptions of virtue are informed by such features in a thoroughly interdisciplinary way. Since development is continuous, Developmental virtue ethics applies to development toward maturity as much as to maturity itself. This chapter considers the roots of virtue in babies, prosocial behavior and its relation to virtue, virtue in children, and virtue in the mature but improving agent, including the prime developmental virtue of maturity\u2014an excellence whose field is improvement in (inter alia) virtue itself.",

      "abstract": "This article has two aims. First, to offer a critical review of the literatures on two well-known single-component solutions to the problem of a gap between moral knowledge and moral action: &lt;i&gt;moral identity&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;moral emotions&lt;/i&gt;. Second, to take seriously the rising interest in Aristotle-inspired virtue ethics and character development within the social sciences: approaches that seem to assume that the development of &lt;i&gt;phronesis&lt;/i&gt; (practical wisdom) bridges the gap in question. Since phronesis is a multicomponent construct, the latter part of this article offers an overview of what those different components would be, as a necessary precursor to operationalising them if the phronesis hypothesis were to be subjected to empirical scrutiny. The idea of a neo-Aristotelian multicomponent solution to the \u201cgappiness problem\u201d invites comparisons with another multicomponent candidate, the neo-Kohlbergian &lt;i&gt;four-component model&lt;/i&gt;, with which it shares at least surface similarities. Some space is thus devoted to the proposed theoretical uniqueness of a phronesis-based multicomponent model vis-\u00e0-vis the neo-Kohlbergian one. Our main conclusion is that \u2013 weaknesses in its developmental psychological grounding notwithstanding \u2013 operationalising the phronesis model for the purposes of instrument design and empirical inquiry would be a feasible and potentially productive enterprise.",

      "abstract": "\"Forensic DNA evidence has helped convict the guilty, exonerate the wrongfully convicted, identify victims of genocide, and reunite families torn apart by war and repressive regimes. Yet many of the scientific, legal, and ethical concepts that underpin forensic DNA evidence remain unclear to the general public, judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and students of law, forensic sciences, ethics, and genetics. Silent Witness examines the history and development of DNA forensics, its applications in the courtroom and humanitarian settings, and the relevant scientific, legal, and psychosocial issues. The last thirty years has seen a resurgence of interest in virtue among philosophers, psychologists, and educators. As is often the case with interdisciplinary endeavors, this renewed interest in virtue faces an important challenge-namely, successfully standing up to the requirements imposed by different disciplinary standards. For virtue, this means developing an account that practitioners from multiple disciplines will find sufficiently rigorous, substantive, and useful. Our volume was born in response to this interdisciplinary challenge. Our objective here is twofold. First, drawing on Whole Trait Theory in psychology and Aristotelian virtue ethics, we offer accounts of virtue and character that are both philosophically sound and psychologically realistic-and thus, able to be meaningfully operationalized into empirically measurable variables. Second, we offer a range of strategies for how virtue and character (so conceived) can be systematically measured, relying on the insights from the latest research in personality, social, developmental, and cognitive psychology, and psychological science more broadly. We thereby seek to contribute to the emerging science of the measurement of virtue and character\"--",

Zagzebski discusses this application in her recent book, commenting that \u2018exemplars can serve as a guide for moral training\u2019 (p. 129) and endorsing \u2018the learning of virtue by imitation\u2019 (p. 129). This theme has been pursued compellingly by authors working at the intersection of virtue ethics and education, contributing to an emerging case for exemplarist-based approaches to character education. I focus on intellectual character education and draw attention to an interesting case in which exemplarism in the classroom may be seen to inhibit, rather than promote, the development of intellectually virtuous character. This is the case of virtuous inquisitiveness.",

Scholars have identified character, founded in virtue ethics, as an important perspective that can help to address the gap in organizational misconduct. While character has been offered as a valid perspective in EDM, current theorizing on how it applies to EDM has not been well developed. We thus integrate character, founded in virtue ethics, into Rest\u2019s (1986) EDM model to reveal how shifting attention to the nature of the moral agent provides critical insights into decision making more broadly and EDM specifically. Virtue ethics provides a perspective on EDM that acknowledges and anticipates uncertainties, considers its contextual constraints, and contemplates the development of the moral agent. We thus answer the call by many scholars to integrate character in EDM in order to advance the understanding of the field and suggest propositions for how to move forward. We conclude with implications of a character-infused approach to EDM for future research.",

Much of this shift has been inspired by an Aristotelian conception of practical wisdom (phronesis) also linked by Aristotle to the development of virtue and character. This has in turn led recent educational philosophers and theorists \u2013 inspired by latter-day developments in virtue ethics and virtue epistemology \u2013 to investigate the contribution of various forms of virtue to the effective practice of teaching. In this light, the present paper undertakes further exploration of the logical geography of virtue, character and practical deliberation in teaching.",

Method Our team identified citations in the literature emphasizing virtue ethics and care ethics (in PubMed, NLM Catalog, WorldCat, EthicsShare, EthxWeb, Globethics.net , Philosopher\u2019s Index, and ProQuest Central) lending themselves to constructs of humanism curricula. Our exclusion criteria consisted of non-English articles, those not addressing virtue and care ethics and humanism in medical pedagogy, and those not addressing aspects of character in health ethics. We examined in a stepwise fashion whether citations: 1) Contained definitions of virtue and care ethics; 2) Implemented virtue and care ethics in health care curricula; and 3) Evidenced patient-directed caregiver humanism. Results Eight hundred eleven citations were identified, 88 intensively reviewed, and the final 25 analyzed in-depth. We identified multiple key themes with relevant metaphors associated with virtue/care ethics, curricula, and humanism education. Conclusions This research sought to better understand how virtue and care ethics can potentially promote humanism and identified themes that facilitate and impede this mission.",

However, given the complex nature of the theory, hardly any work has de facto attempted to implement the core tenets of virtue ethics in moral machines. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how virtue ethics can be taken all the way from theory to machine implementation. To achieve this goal, we critically explore the possibilities and challenges for virtue ethics from a computational perspective. Drawing on previous conceptual and technical work, we outline a version of artificial virtue based on moral functionalism, connectionist bottom\u2013up learning, and eudaimonic reward. We then describe how core features of the outlined theory can be interpreted in terms of functionality, which in turn informs the design of components necessary for virtuous cognition. Finally, we present a comprehensive framework for the technical development of artificial virtuous agents and discuss how they can be implemented in moral environments.",

They adduce empirical psychological studies to highlight the conflicted nature of conscious and nonconscious processes, arguing that because of this, cognition is too fragmented to support the kind of integrated personality needed to sustain robust virtues. This chapter explores the coordination of these two types of processing in the habits that contribute to virtuous character, thereby countering, at least in part, the situationist view of the fragmented nature of cognition. It also investigates three different paradigms of character formation: the \"habits of the folk,\" Julia Annas' account, and Confucian character formation. Each approach combines a different blend of conscious and nonconscious processing in the acquisition of virtue, and all three offer visions of character development that counter the situationist account of the fragmentation of cognitive processes.",

The Catholic tradition's development of the \u2018structures of sin\u2019 in the 1970's and 80's was a significant contribution to magisterial teaching. However, this concept should be updated in light of the trajectory and concepts of post-Vatican II theological ethics. The article proceeds in two parts. Part one recapitulates the development of the concept of structures of sin in the Catholic tradition from the Second Vatican Council to Pope Benedict XVI's recent social encyclical, Caritas in veritate . Part two reflects on the findings of part one, and proceeds to define and defend the concepts structure of virtue and structures of vice. These related concepts more accurately capture the moral nature of social structures. Social structures have the capacity to produce just or unjust outcomes, and to play a significant role in the character formation of persons. Therefore, the structures of virtue and structures of vice are offered as insightful ways of discussing the moral status of social structures.",

Drawing upon the growing body of literature concerning gate-keepingdecisions and the literature exploring the relevance of virtue ethics for social work, thisarticle examines the benefits of an approach that foregrounds the assessment anddevelopment of moral character. The discussion is located within the context of the mostrecent reforms to social work education within England, whilst recognising theinternational relevance of these debates. It is argued that incorporating an approachinformed by virtue ethics has the potential to bridge traditional fault-lines within selectiondebates that have focused upon the tensions between a widening access perspective and afocus upon academic ability. Crucially, this article examines the curriculum and pedagogicissues arising from a commitment to provide opportunities to develop moral character andvirtue. The article argues that a dual focus upon selection and pedagogic issues, with anexplicit focus upon character throughout, is critical to the development of wise, effectiveand virtuous social workers who are able to exercise sound judgment and wisdom across arange of practice contexts",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Some of the debates around the concept of moral enhancement have focused on whether the improvement of a single trait, such as empathy or intelligence, would be a good in general, or in all circumstances. All virtue theories, however, both secular and religious, have articulated multiple virtues that temper and inform one another in the development of a mature moral character. The project of moral enhancement requires a reengagement with virtue ethics and contemporary moral psychology to develop an empirically grounded model of the virtues and a fuller model of character development. Each of these virtues may be manipulable with electronic, psychopharmaceutical, and genetic interventions. A set of interdependent virtues is proposed, along with some of the research pointing to ways such virtues could be enhanced.",

Researching with Integrity aims to identify what and how research can be undertaken ethically and with \u2018virtue\u2019 from initial conception of ideas through to dissemination. It outlines the context in which academics engage in research, considering the impact of discipline and institutional culture, the influence of government audit of research \u2018quality\u2019, the role of government and quangos, professional organisations and business sponsors, and examines the effects of the increasing power and influence of funding bodies, university ethics committees and codes of practice. Based on the notion of \u2018virtue\u2019 ethics, this book proposes an alternative approach to research, which focuses not only on ethical rules and protocol to avoid unethical research, but encourages academic, professional and character development and allows for the exercise of personal judgement. Themes considered include: Increased competitiveness between academics and concentration of funding in fewer universities Increasingly bureaucratic approval of processes focused on the treatment of human and animals in research Meeting the expectations of research sponsors \u2018Taboo\u2019 research topics and methods Exposing findings to the scrutiny of peers, taking credit for the work of others and self-citation Bullying of junior researchers and plagiarism Power and influence of institutional, discipline-based and professional organisations &nbsp; Illustrated throughout with short narratives detailing ethical issues and dilemmas from international academic researchers representing different disciplines, research cultures and national contexts, this books proposes a an alternative approach to research which provides all research professionals with the intellectual tools they need to cope with complex research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The article is devoted to the importance of the virtue of prudence and attempts to adapt it in the contemporary discourse on innovation and sustainable development. The authors come from ancient roots, recalling the positions of Socrates, Plato and, above all, Aristotle. They point to the renewed interest of contemporary researchers in the ethics of virtues and point to the important roles of prudence, prudence and responsibility in the approach to innovation. Innovations are captured as an instrumental value and a tool to shape better living conditions, work, study, rest, all forms of human activity and environmental protection. Therefore, their positive character has been exposed, although the authors also pay attention to the risk and possibility of negative effects if the virtues of nature, such as prudence, caution and responsibility are not well-formed. The authors point out that this is particularly important in the education of engineers who shape the innovative landscape of the present, and prove that this applies to mechatronics or robotics specialists, as well as production engineering specialists, because the ethical approach allows for the appropriate design of the entire team of activities from recognizing the need to satisfy it through an efficient, well-prepared, organized and properly managed production process, taking into account the basic principles of sustainable development.",
