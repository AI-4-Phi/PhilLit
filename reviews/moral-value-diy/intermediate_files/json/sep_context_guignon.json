While\ncontinuously reminding us of the inherently social dimension of\nauthenticity, one of the achievements here is the focus on boundary\nsituations where authenticity \u201cis best forged and\nrevealed\u201d (Ibid.: 201). Golomb takes a neutral position on the\nethical value of authenticity, maintaining that \u201cthere is no\nreason to suppose that it is any better or any more valuable to be\nauthentic than to act inauthentically\u201d (Ibid.: 202).

Besides being a topic in philosophical debates, authenticity is also a\npervasive ideal that impacts social and political thinking.\nIn fact, one distinctive feature of recent Western intellectual\ndevelopments has been a shift to what is called the \u201cage of\nauthenticity\u201d (Taylor 2007; Ferrarra 1998).
