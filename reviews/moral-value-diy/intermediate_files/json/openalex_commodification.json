Specifically, we apply global laborvalue chains and the tragedy of the commodity to analyze severelabor exploitation in Thai capturefisheries. Our analysis suggeststhat severe labor exploitation has played a significant role inlowering the market value of the Thai seafood sector as anadaptation to a competitive marketplace driven by increasingcommodification and a stressed marine ecosystem. Regardingecologies, we detail how the degradation of marine ecosystemsin the region stimulated increased demand for severe laborexploitation.",

      "abstract": "In his 1970 Miary i ludzie (Measures and Men), cofounder of historical metrology and Marxist scholar Witold Kula posited that the right to determine standards was an attribute of authority. What is more, it was a class privilege. Almost fifty years later, in The Value of Labor, Martha Lampland has written an impressive study about a culture of measuring that developed in mid-twentieth-century Hungary in which the role of authority fell to the agrarian professional. Yet in contrast to works by bygone generations of Marxist thinkers, Lampland\u2019s history of standards aims precisely to blur distinctions between capitalism and socialism. Focusing on the creation of the \u201cwork unit,\u201d a technocratic tool in the hands of agrarian modernizers, Lampland argues that the quest for scientific rationalization in Hungary formed a \u201cshared vision of modernity\u201d (16). Lampland\u2019s multidisciplinary approach is deep and demanding but brings very rewarding insights. The Value of Labor succeeds in demonstrating that by \u201cplowing through the \u2026 technical details\u201d we gain a novel perspective on how commodification took shape in the twentieth century (14).",

We provide a consistent account of how information as a commodity effects the workings of both capitalism and of Marxist theory. The first part of the chapter critically revisits Marx\u2019s own writings on the commodification of knowledge and how the immaterial labor hypothesis initially interpreted these writings. Based on the new categories knowledge-commodity and knowledge-rent, we then present our own approach in response to the challenges raised by the immaterial labor hypothesis. Lastly, there is an analysis of the more recent contributions on the commodification of knowledge and information within the Marxist literature. The current debate on the value of knowledge has been divided between two camps: the reproduction cost approach and the average cost approach. Finally, there is a look at empirical estimates of the magnitudes of knowledge-rents.",

While Silicon Valley is still the industry's employment center, San Francisco is seeing faster tech firm growth, and is transforming its downtown to become more \u201clivable\u201d and promoting public space as key to innovation. In this context, this paper offers a reading of urban public space not just as a consumption amenity but also as the \u201cshop floor\u201d of a labor process that goes beyond the walls of the firm to mobilize the social itself in the production of privately appropriated value. With innovation now the watchword of gentrification, the stakes of this shift oscillate between the total commodification of urban vitality and the recognition of the social process of value production itself.",

      "abstract": "Combining platform studies with insights from research on petty capitalism and the political economy of the Chinese Internet, this article takes an integrated approach to analyze key moments in the historical evolution of the Chinese e-commerce monopoly Alibaba since 1999. It argues for a dynamic model of technological and cultural transformations that treats platformization as a set of historically and culturally specific processes and relations constituted by constantly shifting and interacting forces. It finds that in the early days, Alibaba deployed platform mechanisms of participation and commodification to position itself as a democratic and participatory platform contra the deficient infrastructure of the state, while relying on foreign venture capital to keep the tensions of commodification at bay to prioritize market expansion. After Alibaba had achieved monopoly after the 2008 global crisis, it has formed more symbiotic relations with the state, ramping up mechanisms of datafication, selection, and commodification to more effectively extract the surplus value generated through the labor of platform-based petty capitalists. Platform-labor tensions intensified as Alibaba\u2019s profit imperatives began to override its earlier promises of universal access and democratic participation.",

First, it explores the cultural commodification of transgender by exploring the rise of transgender-specific products and consumer markets. Second, it examines the counterpart of trans consumption\u2014trans production\u2014and investigates the emergence of trans-specific labor power and all-trans groups of workers. Third, it offers a critique of trans economic empowerment strategies that have drawn on freelance economies, independent contractors, trans class aspirations, and the global restructuring of work, in efforts to address issues of trans un/der/employment. The article argues that such strategies bolster precarious work conditions and economic insecurities and unwittingly contribute to economic imperialism. Taken together, this article examines links between transgender issues and flows of capital within neoliberal markets.",

      "abstract": "White, male-dominated professions in the United States are marked with substantial gender and racial inequality in career advancement, yet they often face pressures to increase diversity. In these contexts, are theories of employer biases based on gender and racial stereotypes sufficient to explain patterns of hiring discrimination during common career transitions in the external labor market? If not, how and why do discrimination patterns deviate from predictions? Through a case study of software engineering, we first draw from a large-scale audit study and demonstrate unexpected patterns of hiring screening discrimination: while employers discriminate in favor of White men among early-career job applicants seeking lateral positions, for both early-career and senior workers applying to senior jobs, Black men and Black women face no discrimination compared to White men, and White women are preferred. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we explain these patterns of discrimination by demonstrating how decision-makers incorporate diversity value\u2014applicants\u2019 perceived worth for their contribution to organizational diversity\u2014into hiring screening decisions, alongside biases. We introduce diversity commodification as the market-based valuative process by which diversity value varies across job level and intersectional groups. This article offers important implications for our understanding of gender, race, and employer decision-making in modern U.S. organizations.",

      "abstract": "This article examines the role of manual work in bridging the distance between production and consumption in alternative food networks, particularly in urban farming. Scholars and public commentators often draw on Marxian theories of alienation to suggest that manual work constitutes a key strategy for reconnecting production and consumption, and overcoming the ecological rift between natural processes and modern, agro-industrial production. Focusing on urban farming, this article complicates the picture of unalienated, decommodified labor and points to continuous negotiations between experiences of re-embedding in the community and the environment, and the on-going commodification of the farming experience. We argue that urban farms function as sites of \u201cexperiential production\u201d where farm managers stage work experiences for the volunteers and where visitors build new socialities, reconnect to nature, and accrue social and cultural capital in the context of a global economy that offers limited work opportunities for a generation of highly educated college graduates. Relying on ethnographic fieldwork and 40 semi-structured interviews with employed urban farmers and regular volunteers in metropolitan areas of the Northeastern United States as well as the examination of online and print materials, our analysis highlights the contradictory ways in which manual work in alternative food networks indeed counters alienation, while also reproducing consumer society institutions and reinforcing the core values defining neoliberalism such as productivity and self-improvement.",

Without complementary attention to other ways that value is expressed and realized by people, such a focus may inadvertently promote worldviews at odds with fair and desirable futures. It is time to engage seriously with a third class of values, one with diverse roots and current expressions: relational values. By doing so, we reframe the discussion about environmental protection, and open the door to new, potentially more productive policy approaches.",

Dai Muda Pilihan ANTV which was aired in 2011 was also full of commodification, particularly on the Dai (Islam preacher) as the contestants. In this study, the researcher wants to find out the processes and patterns of labor commodification, particularly the Dai in Dai Muda Pilihan ANTV. The method of the research is case study with in-depth interview, participant observation, and documentation as the data collection methods. The result shows that commodification in Dai Muda Pilihan ANTV occurred at pre-production, production, and postproduction. Therefore, the Dai who normatively have religious characters were encouraged to perform well and to entertain in accordance with the commercialization values of the television station which owned the program.

After the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the reliance on the return of displaced culture bearers to facilitate recovery exposed the inner workings of the cultural economy and highlighted long-standing patterns of exploitation that are endemic to black musicians, the culture industry, and global capitalism. This case study, based on years of ethnographic study among black brass band musicians in New Orleans, offers a view of broader issues of heritage tourism, commodification and authenticity, festivalization and exhibition, racial appropriation, and the value of economic and social capital. The author\u2019s observation of musicians provides a foundation for reevaluating live musical performance as a form of labor, extending a large body of literature on the political economy of music with emphasis on the monetary economy of musicians.",

      "abstract": "In Reckoning with Slavery Jennifer L. Morgan draws on the lived experiences of enslaved African women in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to reveal the contours of early modern notions of trade, race, and commodification in the Black Atlantic. From capture to transport to sale to childbirth, these women were demographically counted as commodities during the Middle Passage, vulnerable to rape, separated from their kin at slave markets, and subject to laws that enslaved their children upon birth. In this way, they were central to the binding of reproductive labor with kinship, racial hierarchy, and the economics of slavery. Throughout this groundbreaking study, Morgan demonstrates that the development of Western notions of value and race occurred simultaneously. In so doing, she illustrates how racial capitalism denied the enslaved their kinship and affective ties while simultaneously relying on kinship to reproduce and enforce slavery through enslaved female bodies.",

      "abstract": "In this essay, I focus on problematic ways in which work in composition is defined and valued in dominant Writing Program (WPA) discourse as well as in much of the discourse of unionism emerging in response to that discourse. My argument is that in the claims they make for its value, these discourses contribute to the debasement of both WP A work and the work of composition generally. By effectively accepting terms of valuation by which this work must be judged nega\u00ad tively, they contribute to its denigration: the seemingly inevitable angst of the WP A and the poor working conditions of composition teachers so prevalent in colleges and universities across North America. To the extent that negotiating improvements in the conditions of both forms of work in composition involves invocations of particular values, WP As and those who work under their administration must beware of invok\u00ad ing values that effectively undermine their positions. I begin by examining confusion in the kinds of value accorded work in composition and the role of commodification in the valuation of that work. I then show the operation of this confusion in specific arguments for the value of work in composition: the Council of Writing Program Administrators' position statement Evaluating the Intellectual Work of Writing Administration and recent exchanges in composition forums about labor relations in composition. The discourses in these venues, I argue, participate in commodifications of the work of composition that operate to the detriment of its value in the economies in which those commodities circulate. They do so by occluding the labor involved in the realization of the value of that work, distorting and undercutting its demands and its potential as work both within and on the social.",

      "abstract": "In economics, land has been traditionally assumed to be a fixed production factor, both in terms of quantity supplied and mobility, as opposed to capital and labor, which are usually considered to be mobile factors, at least to some extent. Yet, in the last decade, international investors have expressed an unexpected interest in farmland and in land-related investments, with the demand for land brusquely rising at an unprecedented pace. In spite of a fast-growing literature analyzing the variety of \u201cspaces\u201d affected by large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), the contemporary process of \u201ccommodification\u201d of land embedded in this phenomenon has taken present day economists by surprise. This paper reviews the evolution over time of the concept of land in economics and it suggests how different aspects of this evolution are relevant to the understanding of contemporary LSLAs. Rather than presuming to analyze in a systematic and comprehensive manner the immense literature in land economics, this article investigates what makes land a peculiar and complex commodity. Indeed, different branches of economic thought, at different moments in time, pointed out that the location of land in space matters; that land is a living and fundamental component of the ecosystem; that it is a valuable economic asset, and yet, it is often hard to value it in pure monetary terms; eventually, that land is intrinsically connected to societies, cultural and spiritual identities, mores, and institutions. Through a brief history of the evolution of the concept of land in economics, this paper identifies four broad categories\u2014namely, space, economics, environment, and institutions\u2014that help understanding land as a peculiar good. These four elements characterize land as a commodity, as well as its peculiarities, and constitute the prerequisites of a conceptual framework for the analysis and the understanding of the forces at play in the contemporary wave of large-scale land acquisitions.",
