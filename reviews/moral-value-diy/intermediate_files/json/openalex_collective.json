      "abstract": "Defenses of the possibility of collective guilt feelings falls roughly into two categories: collectivistic positions that assign guilt feelings to groups as such but play down the experiential component in guilt feelings, and individualistic positions which understand collective guilt feelings in terms of individual experiences. The analogy between collective and individual guilt feelings is examined from two collectivistic viewpoints. It is argued that the functional states of collectives and individuals with respect to guilt are less analogous than collectivists assume. Instead, an individualistic perspectival understanding of collective guilt feelings is proposed. Groups as such cannot feel guilty in the morally relevant sense, but guilt as felt by individuals can have a distinctively collective character, such that the feeling still may be an appropriate response to assignments of collective responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Climate change can be construed as a question of collective responsibility from two different viewpoints: climate change being inherently a collective problem, or collective entities bearing responsibility for climate change. When discussing collective responsibility for climate change, \u201ccollective\u201d can thus refer to the problem of climate change itself, or to the entity causing the harm and/or bearing responsibility for it. The first viewpoint focuses on how climate change is a harm that has been caused collectively. Collective action problem refers to an aggregation of individual actions which together produce an outcome that is not intended at the level of an individual action. It cannot be solved by any one agent acting unilaterally. Instead, climate change action must be enacted and supported by numerous agents. The second way to conceptualize climate change as a question of collective responsibility focuses on the collective entities that bear responsibility for climate change. As a global problem, climate change is linked to the realm of international politics, where states, governments, and intergovernmental organizations are the main collective entities. Other important agential collectives in terms of climate responsibility are corporations, including carbon majors who have produced the bulk of emissions. Climate change has also been theorized as a structural injustice , which combines elements from both the viewpoints on what is collective about responsibility for climate change.

      "abstract": "Abstract Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine has upended Europe's security order, with many observers calling it a turning point for the European Union. This article contends, however, that the EU's response has been less a turning point and more of an epiphany, providing a reality check for the EU and its member states about how far European foreign policy cooperation has evolved in recent decades. It suggests that an understanding of the EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine requires consideration of the member states' foreign policy co-operation, which has intensified over the past half-century, and its underpinning norm which we term a \u2018collective European responsibility to act\u2019. In emphasizing this norm, we identify core ideas about the functioning of collective European foreign policy. We re-examine three key preoccupations of the EU foreign policy-making practice and assessment through the lens of the collective European responsibility to act and show how it enables a different and novel re-reading of the added value of EU foreign policy cooperation. The EU's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine thus serves as a timely focusing event that demands a rethink of the premises that have underpinned our analysis and understanding of collective European foreign policy-making over decades.",

This raises the question of collective responsibility. I argue that we can only determine who is responsible for oppression if we understand oppression as a matter of social practices that create obstacles for social change. This social practice view of oppression enables two insights: First, that there is an unproblematic sense in which groups can bear irreducible collective responsibility for oppression. Second, that there are derived forms of individual responsibility for members of dominant groups.",

Such non-distributive attributions can seem problematic in cases where the group is not a moral agent in its own right. In response, it has been argued both that non-agential groups can have the capabilities requisite to have obligations of their own, and that group obligations can be understood in terms of moral demands on individual group members. It has also been suggested that members of groups can share responsibility for an outcome in virtue of being causally or socially connected to that outcome. This chapter discusses the agency problem and argues that the most promising attempts at solutions understand group obligations and blameworthiness as grounded in demands on individual agents.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine how principal support, professional learning communities, collective responsibility, and group-level teacher expectations affect 11th-grade student math achievement. Research Methods: Data for this study were from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. This study used a multilevel structural equation model to examine how principal support, professional learning communities, collective responsibility, and teacher expectations at the group level affect school math achievement. Findings: The study identified a model of school-level factors affecting students: Principal support positively influenced both professional learning communities and collective responsibility, which in turn, affected student math achievement via group-level teacher expectations; on the other hand, the impact of principal support on group-level teacher expectation and the direct associations of both professional learning communities and collective responsibility with student achievement were not statically significant. Implications: Focusing on how a school-level mechanism influences student achievement provides a better understanding of sustaining high school performance through school reform initiatives (e.g., principal leadership training, building professional learning communities, or interventions to improve group-level teachers\u2019 expectations). To improve student achievement, the current study emphasizes why principals should give more attention to exerting supportive and egalitarian leadership that can contribute to a school\u2019s positive climate and lead to changing teachers\u2019 instructional behaviors and attitudes, rather than focusing on directive or restrictive leadership and managing behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1997, and despite several political changes, obesity policy in the UK has overwhelmingly framed obesity as a problem of individual responsibility. Reports, policies and interventions have emphasized that it is the responsibility of individual consumers to make personal changes to reduce obesity. The Foresight Report \u2018Tackling Obesities: Future Choices\u2019 (2007) attempted to reframe obesity as a complex problem that required multiple sites of intervention well beyond the range of personal responsibility. This framing formed the basis for policy and coincided with increasing acknowledgement of the complex nature of obesity in obesity research. Yet policy and interventions developed following Foresight, such as the Change4Life social marketing campaign, targeted individual consumer behaviour. With the Conservative\u2010Liberal Democrat government of 2011, intervention shifted to corporate and individual responsibility, making corporations voluntarily responsible for motivating individual consumers to change. This article examines shifts in the framing of obesity from a problem of individual responsibility, towards collective responsibility, and back to the individual in UK government reports, policies and interventions between 1997 and 2015. We show that UK obesity policies reflect the landscape of policymakers, advisors, political pressures and values, as much as, if not more than, the landscape of evidence. The view that the individual should be the central site for obesity prevention and intervention has remained central to the political framing of population\u2010level obesity, despite strong evidence contrary to this. Power dynamics in obesity governance processes have remained unchallenged by the UK government, and individualistic framing of obesity policy continues to offer the path of least resistance. \u00a9 2016 World Obesity",

      "abstract": "Although rural U.S. school districts are experiencing increases in emergent multilingual learners (EMLLs), many lack the resources for employing TESOL\u2010specialized staff or training mainstream teachers in how to meet these students\u2019 needs (Freeman Field, n.d.). Indeed, professional development (PD) in TESOL is a continued, persistent necessity for all teachers working with linguistically and culturally diverse students (Pettit, 2011). This article examines the role of sustained PD in shaping the beliefs and practices regarding EMLLs of educators in a rural school district. Three focal participants engaged in PD sessions on translanguaging pedagogies. Data from interviews, instructional observations, and focus groups showed articulation of a translanguaging stance. Participants demonstrated pedagogical flexibility and a collective sense of responsibility (indexed by the phrase \u201cit is a village\u201d) as well as other beliefs and practices characteristic of translanguaging stance, design, and shifts (Garc\u00eda, Ibarra Johnson, &amp; Seltzer, 2017). This study addresses a gap in TESOL research regarding how PD can shape educators\u2019 attitudes toward and practices with EMLLs. Furthermore, by incorporating often\u2010overlooked members of elementary school ecologies, such as literacy coaches and world languages teachers, this study emphasizes the valuable role that these individuals can play in supporting EMLLs schoolwide.",

We argue that while collective moral responsibility is not uniquely tied to the former, the degree to which the participants in a shared intentional wrongdoing are blameworthy is normally higher than when agents bring about the same wrong as a result of strategic interaction. One argument for this claim focuses on the fact that shared intentions cause intended outcomes in a more robust manner than the intentions involved in strategic interaction. We argue, however, that this in itself is not significant. The significant difference is rather volitional: The parties to a shared intention are mutually implicated in each other\u2019s will in a distinct way. Since degree of blameworthiness depends on the quality of will an agent displays in her actions, this explains the higher degree of collective blameworthiness associated with shared intentional wrongdoing.",

Answering these questions is often taken to depend on whether groups are genuine agents in much the same way individual persons are. There are many views developed in the service of this end, but I will focus on one underappreciated aspect of this debate\u2014namely, the role of commitments in explaining aspects of shared agency. Although commitments are not typically used to explain collective responsibility, their putative role in various views of shared agency underscores the value of exploring the connection between the two. I begin with a discussion of commitments (\u00a713.1). I formulate a case to highlight commitments' defining characteristics, with a special focus on how they might be fruitfully used to understand both individual and collective responsibility. In \u00a713.2, I summarize the role of commitments in the literature on shared agency, with a particular focus on Margaret Gilbert's and Michael Bratman's respective accounts. I then turn to the relationship between (moral and non-moral) commitments and backward-looking collective responsibility (\u00a713.3).",

We argue that most of the ways in which the notion of collective responsibility has been attributed to different types of groups actually refer to a form of responsibility that is not genuinely collective, but that boils down to some form of individual responsibility. We identify an intrinsically collective kind of responsibility and argue that it can be attributed to only one kind of group. We begin by setting two necessary and sufficient conditions for attribution of genuinely collective moral responsibility, asking whether these two conditions are satisfied in the case of different types of groups that have been taken to be bearers of moral responsibility: organized groups, groups with internal bonds of solidarity, groups that program individuals to act in a certain way, random collections of individuals, and individuals engaging in joint actions. Contrary to what various authors have maintained, we argue that only in the case of individuals engaging in joint actions is attribution of a genuinely collective form of moral responsibility warranted, i.e. only groups engaging in joint action satisfy the two conditions for attribution of genuinely collective moral responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The advent of the internet, the exponential growth in computing power and the rapid developments in artificial intelligence have given rise to numerous ethical questions in relation to cybersecurity across various domains, not least by virtue of the dual-use character of cybertechnology\u2014it can be used to provide great benefits to humankind, but also to do great harm. The domains in question intersect and include business (e.g., data security, data ownership and privacy), public communication (e.g., disinformation and computational propaganda), health (e.g., privacy, ransomware attacks), law enforcement (e.g., data security, predictive policing), and interstate conflict (e.g., cyberwar, autonomous weapons). This work undertakes analyses of the key ethical concepts in play, such as privacy, freedom of communication, security, and the right to self-defence. This work also develops sets of ethical guidelines to give direction to the regulation of cyberspace in these various domains. It does so from a liberal democratic perspective that seeks to protect individual rights while ensuring the collective good of cybersecurity. A central informing idea is that of institutionally embedded collective moral responsibilities that function as \u201cwebs of prevention\u201d against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity is, in the end, a collective moral responsibility of both individual citizens and organizations, but a collective responsibility the discharging of which requires new regulation and the redesign of institutional roles, as well as technical countermeasures to cyberattacks, such as passwords, encryption, firewalls, patching, and the like. It also involves at times, we suggest, offensive as well as defensive measures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Harms arising from digital data use in the big data context are often systemic and cannot always be captured by linear cause and effect. Individual data subjects and third parties can bear the main downstream costs arising from increasingly complex forms of data uses\u2014without being able to trace the exact data flows. Because current regulatory frameworks do not adequately address this situation, we propose a move towards harm mitigation tools to complement existing legal remedies. In this article, we make a normative and practical case for why individuals should be offered support in such contexts and how harm mitigation tools can achieve this. We put forward the idea of \u2018Harm Mitigation Bodies\u2019 (HMBs), which people could turn to when they feel they were harmed by data use but do not qualify for legal remedies, or where existing legal remedies do not address their specific circumstances. HMBs would help to obtain a better understanding of the nature, severity, and frequency of harms occurring from both lawful and unlawful data use, and they could also provide financial support in some cases. We set out the role and form of these HMBs for the first time in this article.",

Overcoming such a tyranny will require both accepting responsibility for the future and meeting the institutional gap. I propose that we approach the first in terms of a traditional \u201cdelegated responsibility\u201d model of the transmission of individual responsibility to collectives, and the second with a call for a global constitutional convention focused on future generations. In this paper, I develop the delegated responsibility model by suggesting how it leads us to understand both past failures and prospective responsibility. I then briefly defend the call for a global constitutional convention.",

The social representations approach was adopted, and the collective symbolic coping model was used as a frame of analysis, integrating collective emotions to enhance the understanding of coping processes. The original feature of this study is that the analysis is at group level. Seven focus groups were conducted with French students. An original use of focus groups was proposed: Discussions were structured to induce feelings of collective responsibility and enable observation of how groups cope with such feelings at various levels (social knowledge; social identities; group dynamics). Two analyses were conducted: Qualitative analysis of participants\u2019 use of various kinds of knowledge, social categories and the group dynamics, and lexicometric analysis to reveal how emotions varied during the different discussion phases. Results showed that groups\u2019 emotional states moved from negative to positive: They used specific social categories and resorted to shared stereotypes to cope with collective responsibility and maintain the integrity of their worldview. Only then did debate become possible again; it was anchored in the nature\u2010culture dichotomy such that groups switched from group\u2010based to system\u2010based emotions.",

In doing so, it considers how school leaders influence how immigrant students are positioned within the sociocultural practices of schools, as well as structures and practices that empower teachers to develop rigorous and responsive curriculum and to support students varied needs.",
