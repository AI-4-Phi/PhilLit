From the perspective of ecological ethics, the integration of ecological aesthetics, focusing on the unity of utilitarianism and non-utilitarianism, is a new realm of pursuing the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, which contains a deep reflection on a community of shared life. It is because of the aesthetic emotions, such as awe, nobility and love that the belief of ecological ethics in protecting the ecological environment is aroused, which urges man to take actions to protect ecological environment and jointly build a community of shared life for man and nature.",

Individual states have limited capacities to effectively tackle such large-scale, complex emergencies on their own. Highlighting the moral implications of the philosophical notion of joint action, this commentary makes the case for a particular type of responsibility, which can only be discharged when states deliberate and coordinate their actions. Moreover, it explores what this notion of shared responsibility means for Australia-and its international relationships-with respect to responding to climate chaos and COVID-19. Even though Australia, acting on its own, can neither significantly mitigate climate change nor halt the current global pandemic, it nevertheless has demanding moral responsibilities to respond to both. This is because the capacities necessary to affect meaningful change can be created through collaboration with other institutional agents. In the absence of intergovernmental organizations able to respond effectively to such crises, Australia has shared responsibilities to contribute to establishing, and then acting as part of, informal, purpose-driven, climate change and COVID-19 \u2018coalitions of the obligated\u2019.",

      "abstract": "To complement previous research on the top-down inclusion of ethics training within engineering programs, this Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper describes a supplementary strategy acknowledging and supporting ethics training as a shared responsibility. As science and technology have ethical impact, accreditation bodies have in the past decades mandated the inclusion of ethics in STEM education. However, the implementation of ethics education is fraught with obstacles. Through a case study of a Faculty-wide effort to support shared responsibility for ethics training, the pros and cons of an institutionally embedded ethics approach are discussed. It is argued that such an approach can provide a rooted base that can also serve to comply with more formal ethics evaluations, by strengthening a view of ethics as craft, acknowledging subject teachers as ethics ambassadors, reforming the hidden curriculum, and depoliticizing institutional politics.",

After recalling that concerns about preparedness and vulnerability have come to the fore in the domains of \u00abdisaster risk reduction\u00bb over the last decades, the article will endorse the view that the demarcation between natural disasters and human-induced disasters has becoming blurred and even questionable in many cases. Then, it will be argued that the ethical assessment of disasters needs to consider the entire disaster cycle and that ethical duties extend to the phase of disaster preparedness and require a framework of prospective and shared responsibilities. Accordingly, a number of ethical duties concerning disaster preparedness will be commented upon. Finally, the article will discuss a specific socio-epistemic dynamics of blame assignment that unbalances the appraisal of both vulnerability conditions and moral responsibilities of certain worst-off disaster victims",

      "abstract": "It can be noticed that the practice of Buddhism in Thailand goes beyond the four walls of a Buddhist temple simply because members are expected to incorporate their faith into their way of life. Such being the case, this article examines how the Eightfold Path of the Buddhist tradition is being integrated into various aspects of Thai life especially when His Royal Highness King Bhumibol Aduljadej initiated in 1997 the philosophy of Self-Sufficiency Economy and inspired His people to fulfill it. The said model puts a high premium on living and behaving for the people by considering moderation, rationality, immunity (prudence), and the use of knowledge guided by moral precepts from the family level as components necessary for surviving crises and achieving sustainability amidst social, political, economic, and environmental concerns due to the impact of globalization. This article substantiates how the Self-Sufficiency Economy has been realized in different areas of Thai society by presenting holistic efforts or concrete cases that indicate the Eightfold Path among Thais using aesthetic appreciation theory. Thus, this paper describes how the Thai Royal Government and Buddhism fulfill their shared responsibility in maintaining balanced economic forces, environmental preservation, cultural and spiritual values, and good governance.",

Exploring case studies where access to conservation, and thus the right to heritage, is disrupted by social inequities, this paper argues that conservation\u2014as a normative discipline premised on the idea of a future in which heritage is accessible and open to interpretation, use, and enjoyment\u2014must, like social equity and justice movements, work to create more equitable sociopolitical futures.Theorizing that conservation is a public good, case studies of Aboriginal art centers in remote and regional Australia and conservation education in Australia establish the need to rebalance conservation in areas that have experienced past structural injustice. Drawing on ethical and political philosophy, critical evaluations of the profession that attempt to redefine conservation discourses are proposed to demonstrate the obligation of conservation to account for principles of social equity and justice. Overall, the paper reflects on the philosophical, ethical, and societal implications for the profession of understanding conservation as a public good.",

The article assesses how the introduction of IoT brings risks to the security of medical systems. The justification for this research emerges from the opportunities emerging from digital technologies for medical services, but also creating a range of new cyber risks in the shared healthcare infrastructure. Such concerns are often not visible to individual departments in an integrated healthcare system. In addition, many healthcare organisations do not possess cyber skills and are faced with barriers to the adoption of smart manufacturing technologies, e.g., cost. These barriers trigger ethical concerns related to responsibility of cyber risks in shared healthcare systems.",

      "abstract": "In \u2018Ethics of sharing medical knowledge with the community: is the physician responsible for medical outreach during a pandemic?\u2019 Strous and Karni note that the revised physician\u2019s pledge in the World Medical Association Declaration of Geneva obligates individual physicians to share medical knowledge, which they interpret to mean a requirement to share knowledge publicly and through outreach. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Strous and Karni defend a form of medical paternalism insofar as the individual physician must reach out to communities who may not want, or know to seek out, medical advice, for reasons of public health and health equity. Strous and Karni offer a novel defence of why physicians ought to intervene even in insular communities, and they offer suggestions for how this could be done in culturally sensitive ways. Yet their view rests on an unfounded interpretation of the Geneva Declaration language. More problematically, their paper confuses shared and collective responsibility, misattributing the scope of individual physician obligations in potentially harmful ways. In response, this reply delineates between shared and collective responsibility, and suggests that to defend the obligation of medical outreach Strous and Karni propose, it is better conceptualised as a collective responsibility of the medical profession, rather than a shared responsibility of individual physicians. This interpretation rejects paternalism on the part of individual providers in favour of a more sensitive and collaborative practice of knowledge sharing between physicians and communities, and in the service of collective responsibility.",

Neurodiversity, the natural variation in human brains and cognition, is fundamental to understanding human behavior, yet neurodivergent individuals in academia are often stigmatized, undervalued, or pressured to mask their differences. This position statement, authored predominantly by neurodivergent scholars, explores how aligning the values of the neurodiversity movement with practices of Open Scholarship (OSch) can foster greater research integrity, rigor, social responsibility and justice, diversity, equity, inclusivity, and accessibility in academia. We review systemic barriers faced by neurodivergent researchers\u2014from disclosure dilemmas and hidden curriculum expectations to intersectional disadvantages\u2014and identify how OSch principles (transparency, accessibility, collaboration) can help mitigate these challenges. Drawing on lived experiences and current research, we propose concrete reforms, including adopting universal design in scholarly communication, promoting participatory research methods, and enacting supportive policies (e.g., flexible work arrangements, inclusive codes of conduct). By leveraging shared values of openness and neuro\u2010inclusion, academia can become more just and epistemically equitable. Our recommendations chart a path toward an academic culture where neurodivergent scholars can thrive openly, to the benefit of scientific rigor and social justice alike\n.",

It attempts to explore not only the persistence of \u2018collective guilt\u2019 in students\u2019 responses, but also new possibilities that are opened when \u2018collective guilt\u2019 is reframed as \u2018shared responsibility\u2019. The analysis addresses the moral, political and pedagogical implications of viewing the phenomena of collective guilt and shared responsibility through the lenses of Hannah Arendt and Iris Marion Young. The paper suggests that, using Arendt\u2019s and Young\u2019s accounts of shared responsibility offers educators and students opportunities to become aware of their responsibilities as members of particular social groups, rather than getting stuck in guilt. The proposed pedagogy of shared responsibility is not focused on blame, guilt or fault, but rather it has the potential to minimize denials of complicity and instead encourage students to interrogate the conditions under which they are responsive and responsible to others.",

Moreover, military intervention may, when necessary, be one means of discharging this proposed \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 or, more colloquially, \u2018R2P\u2019. But, where exactly is this responsibility located? In other words, which body or bodies can be expected to discharge a duty to safeguard those who lack the protection of\u2014or, indeed, come under threat from\u2014their own government? In this chapter, I propose \u2018coalitions of the willing\u2019 as one (likely provocative) answer to this question, and explore how the informal nature of such associations should inform the judgements of moral responsibility that we make in relation to them. Perhaps most controversially, I suggest that, under certain circumstances, states and other entities each have a duty to contribute to establishing such an ad hoc association.",

      "abstract": "This study seeks to further explore ongoing criticisms of how authority is distributed and decentralized within Social Welfare Organizations in Zimbabwe, particularly examining these processes through the lens of Ubuntu philosophy. Concerns center on how upper management delegates power, raising debates about both the possible abdication of responsibility and whether distribution practices align with Ubuntu\u2019s core values. One main issue is that delegation of tasks often occurs without adequate attention to respecting staff members\u2019 dignity or acknowledging their inherent worth, which undermines effective task execution and equitable work distribution in community-focused organizations. In Zimbabwe\u2019s government-affiliated agencies, participatory elements of democracy are frequently neglected during task delegation,\u00a0leadership tends to emphasize their own involvement in policy, coordination, and monitoring, rather than sharing these vital functions. However, lower-tier managers are sometimes afforded the autonomy and resources necessary for creative problem-solving in their job roles. The research was conducted using a combination of desktop reviews and case studies, integrating both qualitative and quantitative methods such as observation, group discussions, and interviews. Participants were drawn from a diverse range of international and national organizations operating in Zimbabwe, including both statutory and non-statutory entities. Results suggest that many criticisms of delegation and decentralization stem from entrenched bureaucratic processes and structural inequalities. Participants observed that these decentralized approaches could impede the promotion of organizational ethics and values, with some leaders failing to uphold respect and empathy, especially when sharing authority and decision-making roles.",
