      "abstract": "\n Blame is typically justified on the basis of retrospective desert. However, an emerging strand of account gives an alternative justification for blame: the forward-looking, or proleptic, effects of that blame in cultivating a desirable form of agency, shared moral considerations responsive agency. These instrumentalist accounts differ as to their grounding conditions: the agential features that licence blame in cases of moral failure. Some accounts advocate grounding such justified blame in terms of whether or not the agent meets the condition of influenceability; others advocate the condition of reasons-responsiveness. I will argue that influenceability is unsuccessful as a grounding condition: such accounts appear to licence blame in too many cases of bad action (or omission). In order to not do so, it is unclear how they can avoid either reducing to another kind of grounding condition, such as reasons-responsiveness, or abandoning any attempt to posit a substantive grounding condition. However, the reasons-responsiveness condition has also been attacked: it appears to be vulnerable to a mismatch between the proleptic goals of the accounts to which it is a part, and to empirical evidence suggesting an apparent situational lack of control. I will defend reasons-responsiveness as a grounding condition; however, I will suggest that instrumentalist accounts should be focused less on their grounding conditions and on blame, and more on the empirical efficacy of our reactive attitudes in scaffolding moral agency. In light of these considerations, I will suggest a friendly revision to Vargas\u2019 grounding condition drawing on Fischer and Ravizza, Holroyd, and Calhoun that, I think, better accommodates the proleptic concerns that motivate Vargas\u2019 and McGeer\u2019s accounts.",

      "abstract": "This paper aims to examine whether agents are to be held morally responsible for their actions in a deterministic world. In order to do so, the paper puts the most demanding species of moral responsibility, accountability, at its center and argues for a compatibilist framework grounded in guidance control. Where actions issue from an owned, adequately reasons-responsive mechanism. Main central concepts are explicitly clarified, such as leeway vs. source-hood interpretations of what is necessary to be free, and introducing different perspectives on the topic at hand. It then evaluates the Compatibilism argument against the Incompatibilism, including notable classical arguments and critiques. Building on Fischer and Ravizzas model, the paper defends reasons-responsiveness and historical ownership as sufficient for responsibility in the absence of freewill. This paper seeks to align theory with intuition, such that the intuitive sense of morality does not diminish and preserve the desert-based evaluation, the integrity of blame, praise, and sanction within a causally ordered world.",

We take our cue from a recent paper by Yishai Cohen, who argues that if time travel is metaphysically possible, then one of the most influential theories of moral responsibility (i.e., Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s) is false. We argue that Cohen\u2019s argument is unsound but that Cohen\u2019s argument can serve as a lens to bring reasons-responsive theories of moral responsibility into sharper focus, helping us to better understand\u00a0actual-sequence theories of moral responsibility more generally and showing how actual-sequence theorists should respond to a recent criticism.",

      "abstract": "According to one highly influential approach to moral responsibility, human beings are responsible (eligible to be praised or blamed) for what they do because they are responsive to reasons (Fischer & Ravizza 1998). However, this amounts to a descriptive assumption about human beings that may not be borne out by the empirical research. According to a recent trend in moral psychology (Haidt 2001), most human judgment is caused by fast, nonconscious, and intuitive processes, rather than explicit, conscious deliberation about one\u2019s reasons. And when humans do engage in explicit deliberation, it primarily serves to provide post hoc rationalization of their intuitive judgments (confabulation). If this is correct, it is tempting to conclude that most of our judgments\u2014and the actions we perform on their basis\u2014are not genuine responses to reasons. The reasons-responsiveness approach would thus appear to be committed to the implausible conclusion that we are not responsible for very much after all, including, most problematically, our implicit biases. I argue that the reasons-responsiveness approach can avoid this conclusion by showing three things: (1) that affective and intuitive processes can be reasons-responsive; (2) that the responsiveness of those processes can be bolstered by the agent\u2019s environment; and (3) that practices like blame are one of the key ways in which human beings are attuned to reasons over time. I argue that the first and second of these items, despite their initial plausibility, are insufficient on their own to explain why humans can be held accountable for things like implicit biases, and that the way forward is to appreciate what holding each other accountable does\u2014i.e., its effects.",

      "abstract": "According to Fischer and Ravizza, an agent has guidance control over some action A, whenever A is issued from one of their own moderately reasons-responsive mechanisms. This involves two elements: (i) the process P leading to their action being suitably responsive to reasons-(moderately reasons-responsive); and (ii) their taking an attitude towards processes of kind P such that they see themselves as the agents of the behaviour those processes issue (what they call \u2018taking responsibility\u2019 for a mechanism). For the purposes of this paper, I assume that guidance control amounts to actually guiding some action. I present, and defend, a counterexample in which an agent intentionally acts via a suitably reasons-responsive process which they have taken responsibility for and yet, intuitively, does not actually guide their action. On this basis, I argue that taking responsibility for a moderately reasons-responsive mechanism is not sufficient for having guidance control.",
