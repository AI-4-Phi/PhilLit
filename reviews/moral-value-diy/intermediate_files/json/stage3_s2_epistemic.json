      "abstract": "\n This paper argues that philosophical debates between Ny\u0101ya and Buddhists on the nature and acquisition of testimonial knowledge present contrasting images of the role played by the epistemic agent in the knowing process. According to Ny\u0101ya, an individual can acquire testimonial knowledge automatically\u2014and with little epistemic work\u2014from a trustworthy speaker\u2019s say-so. On the other hand, Buddhist epistemologists, who claim that testimonial knowledge is a species of inferential knowledge, argue that, in order to acquire knowledge from a speaker\u2019s statements, an epistemic agent must possess non-testimonial evidence for the reliability of the testimony in question. This disagreement regarding the division of epistemic labour in testimonial exchanges demonstrates how differently Ny\u0101ya and Buddhist philosophers view the prevalence and practical importance of testimonial knowledge. For Ny\u0101ya, the ubiquity and easy acquisition of testimonial knowledge help explain the success of our daily actions. However, for Buddhist epistemologists, despite the regularity with which we successfully act based on what others tell us, testimonial knowledge is, in fact, less common, and more difficult to acquire, than we might think.",

This article points to three explanatory factors: the challenge of forming accurate beliefs when overwhelmed with information, an implausibly individualistic conception of epistemic virtue, and an adversarial information environment that suborns epistemic dependence. Normally we cope with the problems of informational excess by relying on other people, including sociotechnical systems that mediate testimony and evidence. But when we attempt to engage in epistemic \u201csuperheroics\u201d - withholding trust from others and trying to figure it all out for ourselves \u2013 these can malfunction in ways that make us vulnerable to forming irrational beliefs. Some epistemic systems are prone to coalescing audiences around false conspiracy theories. This analysis affords a new perspective on philosophical efforts to understand conspiracy theories and other epistemic projects prone to collective irrationality.",

      "abstract": "The contemporary era of continuous online communication and informational availability on the Internet - on websites, social networks, forums, blogs, podcasts, and like - has transformed how we produce, distribute and disseminate knowledge. These communicational circumstances are often described as ?hostile epistemic circumstances? due to widespread epistemic pollution with content that endeavours to bias beliefs instead of providing accurate information. As digital communication is both a situation of increased epistemic dependence and a source of heightened risk of being deceived or forming an unjustified belief, the evidential standards for ascribing trust accordingly become more challenging. The circumstances of digital communication thus require us to reconsider the traditional discussion on reductionism and anti-reductionism within the epistemology of testimony. The evidential basis for ascribing trust in the digital era must include assessments of the absence of reasonable doubt about being misinformed and higher-order evidence about the reliability of our own credibility capacities in virtual communication. These epistemically responsible testimonial practices of gathering evidence are hampered by testimonial arrogance, an epistemically corruptive overconfidence in one?s own epistemic capacities encouraged and cultivated within online communication.",

      "abstract": "Richard Moran Recent interest in the epistemology of testimony has focused attention on what justification we may commonly have in the vast areas of life where we are dependent on what other people tell us. This dependence is not restricted to what we are told in face-to-face encounters, for we also take ourselves to know all sorts of things that only reached us through a long chain of utterances and documents, whose evidential status we have never investigated for ourselves and will never be in a position to investigate. And the content of such knowledge is not confined to the arcana of specialized studies but includes such mundane matters as the facts of one\u2019s own birth and parentage, the geographical and institutional facts of one\u2019s immediate environment, and the general facts that make up one\u2019s basic sense of what the world is like. In part it is the enormity of this dependence that makes for the interest in the subject of testimony, combined with the apparent clash between the kind of epistemic relations involved here and the classic empiricist picture of genuine knowledge basing itself either on direct experience of the facts or on working out conclusions for oneself. It isn\u2019t just that the bulk of what we take ourselves to know is so highly mediated, as even knowledge gained through a microscope or other scientific instrument must be; rather it is that the vehicle of mediation here\u2014what other people say\u2014seems so flimsy, unregulated, and is known in plenty of cases to be unreliable, even deliberately so.

The latter occurs when the impossibility of critically assessing the soundness of a system\u2019s output in situ implies a moral obligation to comply with its recommendation since a failure to do so constitutes a moral risk that cannot be justified then and there. We analyse the epistemic and moral consequences of harmful epistemic dependence on the status of medical professionals.

It is either dependence on others\u2019 testimonies or dependence on others\u2019 rational judgments. Distinguishing the \u201cscholar\u201d and the \u201ccommoner,\u201d Kant depicts his bona fide knower as a scholar who selects his epistemic peers judiciously, seeking credible testimonies and worthwhile rational judgments only from other scholars, that is, only from those who satisfy a stringent scholarship condition. I study this account of epistemic dependence in connection with Kant\u2019s characterizations of non-whites as lacking requisite motives or cognitive capacities to be recognized as worthy epistemic peers. I use Kristie Dotson\u2019s three-tiered framework of \u201cepistemic oppression\u201d to shed light on the depth and complexity of the continued challenges posed by this construction of non-whites as not-knowers. My analysis ends with a reflection on the state of mainstream Kant scholarship, followed by a rallying call to those who can see beyond a false dichotomy between \u201cKant scholars\u201d and \u201cKant\u2019s critics\u201d and be open to the possibility of what I call \u201ccritical Kant scholarship.\u201d",

In this paper, I present a counterexample from scientific practice, AlphaFold2. I argue that for epistemic reliance on an opaque system, trust is not necessary, but reliability is. What matters is whether, for a given context, the reliability of a DNN has been compellingly established by empirical means and whether there exist trustable researchers who have performed such evaluations adequately.",

Knowledge from testimony, which is one category of acquisition of epistemic resources from others, has been studied extensively by epistemologists. We can begin to explore the wider realm of epistemic sharing by varying the characteristic features of testimony. Eleven dimensions of variation provide some structure to this domain. The interactive complexity of the dimensions suggests a virtue epistemological approach to the evaluation of patterns of receptivity to the variety of sharings that we confront as knowers.",

Rather than assessing them based on empirical evidence alone, which is often seen as neutral and value-free, narrativism calls for a broader perspective. This is because no description of people and their behavior can be value-neutral. Narrativism thus aligns with constructivist theories of linguistic meaning, linked to the \"linguistic turn.\" I propose a dialogue between narrativism and the epistemology of testimony. By adopting the latter's concepts (trust, authority, and epistemic community), narrativism can 1) reconstruct practices of epistemic validation in history and 2) address the historian\u2019s responsibility to marginalized voices. Simultaneously, I argue that the epistemology of testimony should engage with narrativism to better understand the complexity of narrative constructions in epistemic communities.",

      "abstract": "The question of whether AI systems have morally relevant interests -- the'model welfare'question -- depends in part on how we evaluate AI testimony about inner states. This paper develops what I call the inconsistency critique: independent of whether skepticism about AI testimony is ultimately justified, our actual epistemic practices regarding such testimony exhibit internal inconsistencies that lack principled grounds. We functionally treat AI outputs as testimony across many domains -- evaluating them for truth, challenging them, accepting corrections, citing them as sources -- while categorically dismissing them in a specific domain, namely, claims about inner states. Drawing on Fricker's distinction between treating a speaker as an'informant'versus a'mere source,'the framework of testimonial injustice, and Goldberg's obligation-based account of what we owe speakers, I argue that this selective withdrawal of testimonial standing exhibits the epistemically problematic structure of prejudgment rather than principled caution. The inconsistency critique does not require taking a position on whether AI systems have morally relevant properties; rather, it is a contribution to what we may call'epistemological hygiene'-- examining the structure of our inquiry before evaluating its conclusions. Even if our practices happen to land on correct verdicts about AI moral status, they do so for reasons that cannot adapt to new evidence or changing circumstances.",

Some philosophers argue that marginalized people have an epistemic advantage concerning their experiences of marginalization, such that, if we are non\u2010marginalized, then we should defer to their moral testimony concerning these experiences. We might accept this as a requirement for ordinary conversation but doubt that any such requirement obtains when we do philosophy, since philosophy requires a critical stance. This paper argues that philosophers should also defer in such cases. It concludes that non\u2010marginalized philosophers can only properly address certain moral propositions concerning the experiences of marginalized people if they engage in ongoing philosophical discussions with such people, starting from a position of trust.",
