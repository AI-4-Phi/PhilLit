Complementing the perspective of the article, it advocates an approach that does not see the causal mechanism of disorder-related behaviour in terms of an exclusive disjunction between the effects of the individual patient's own agency or manifestations of the illness. When reduced agency becomes part of the person's self-conception, passivity no longer means behaviour that is alien to their \u2018genuine self\u2019. Relatedly, the requirement that the patient's self-conception be validated raises some questions regarding its therapeutic constraints.",

      "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates self-reflective practices\u2014from therapeutic conversational agents to personal informatics systems\u2014it becomes crucial to examine how these technologies shape, rather than merely support, our self-understanding. This paper investigates the influence of AI-mediated journaling systems on Reflective Agency\u2014the capacity to interpret and make meaning of one\u2019s experiences autonomously. Drawing on phenomenology and Aristotelian virtue ethics, we propose the Reflective Agency Framework (RAF): a normative model with five design principles for such AI tools\u2014Internal Origination, Calibrated Responsiveness, Reflective Ambiguity, Transparency of Mediation, and Self-Continuity and Ethical Flourishing.\n\nWe demonstrate RAF\u2019s relevance through a two-part empirical case study: first, a systematic feature-tension analysis of six widely used AI-mediated journaling applications; second, an exploration of user perceptions and responses to these tensions and principles. Mapping these insights back to RAF, we identify persistent conflicts between automation and autonomy and offer design considerations that preserve the interpretive space essential for self-development. Our findings reveal that over-automation in AI-mediated reflection can erode agency. We urge designers and researchers to adopt and extend our framework to ensure future technologies genuinely support autonomy and meaningful self-discovery in digital well-being. Ultimately, we envision AI not as a guide, but as a quiet companion\u2014helping individuals stay connected to their evolving sense of self and remain the primary agents in their self-discovery, thereby preserving what we define as Reflective Agency.",

In this paper we undertake a systematic analysis of the differences between basic, autonomous, and moral agency in artificial systems. We argue that while current AI systems are highly sophisticated, they lack genuine agency and autonomy because: they operate within rigid boundaries of pre-programmed objectives rather than exhibiting true goal-directed behaviour within their environment; they cannot authentically shape their engagement with the world; and they lack the critical self-reflection and autonomy competencies required for full autonomy. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of future systems that could achieve a limited form of artificial moral agency without consciousness through hybrid approaches to ethical decision-making. This leads us to suggest, by appealing to the necessity of consciousness for moral patiency, that such non-conscious AMAs might represent a case that challenges traditional assumptions about the necessary connection between moral agency and moral patiency.",

      "abstract": "When I bumped into Taylor\u2019s Philosophical Papers, I had been to lectures on and studied texts by Wittgenstein, Foucault, Kuhn, Hegel, Kant, Rawls, Habermas, Walzer, Rorty, MacIntyre, some Heidegger, and I was struck by how these separate strands of thought suddenly formed aspects of a coherent picture. Each of those thinkers had seemed to be saying something important and true, and now Taylor \u2013 commenting these thinkers and others \u2013 provided a secure view of how it all hangs together; adding new equally important topics of his own. That then inspired me to write a dissertation and some other texts on Taylor\u2019s work. One topic on which Charles Taylor\u2019s work stands out is that of self-expression. He has captured both the importance of implicit background sense of things, orientation and \u201cknow-how\u201d on the one hand and the role of articulations on the other, showing how the latter aim to be faithful to the implicit grasp and transform it at the same time. Taylor attributes this view to the Expressivists of the Romantic movement and to Hegel, but the most illuminating texts on this topic seem to be by no one else than Taylor himself. The model of expressive striving is an artist who starts with an inchoate sense of what she wants to achieve. She then struggles with getting a draft done, with \u201cexternalizing\u201d the idea in an external medium. In the first draft, she perceives a partial realization of the idea \u2013 it falls short of being yet an adequate and faithful rendering of the idea, but on the other hand is more determinate and more detailed than the inchoate initial idea. Perceiving, \u201ctaking in,\u201d that determinate version is a genuine learning experience, it alters, reshapes the initial grasp. It first of all has aspects which fall short of the original idea and which illuminate some sides of the original idea negatively: the artist can now see some details that will not do. Second, some details appear as faithful realizations of the compressed inchoate sense that was the starting point. It had not yet unfolded in any detail, so the draft makes the inchoate sense more determinate and detailed.",

      "abstract": "Marx's interpretation of \u2018praxis\u2019 as a primary expression of what we are, of self-realisation and what we might achieve as social beings, frames his revolutionary thought. This article connects Marx's unique approach to certain forms of contemporary grassroots resistance and community-based postcapitalist responses to global heating and the totalitarianism of capital. In particular, his appreciation of humans as at one with nature supports a postcapitalist imaginary abolishing the contradiction between humans and more-than-human nature intrinsic to capitalist practices. By reference to critical theorists such as Jasper Bernes and autonomist Marxist authors Harry Cleaver and P.M. (Hans Widmer), the article identifies key principles of a nonmarket socialist form of postcapitalism, i.e. beyond both state and money. Work as waged labour under the rule of capitalists gives way to ecologically and socially constructive activities fulfilling collective sufficiency cogoverned and coproduced by all. Work is freed up as semi-voluntary activity, negotiated within a community mode of production where the product is both predetermined (co-planned) and, later, shared on the basis of satisfying basic needs. In contrast to strictly defined capitalist waged work, now standard across various geographies and cultures, the postcapitalist community mode of production proposed establishes convivial and ecologically appropriate work within local geographies of community sufficiency. Even as universal (global) principles typify the community mode of production, symbiotically respectful relations between humans and nature give rise to unique localised geographies of ecological diversity and pluralism.",

      "abstract": "In a rapidly evolving postmodern world characterized by technological advancements, cultural fragmentations, and either shifting or disappearing social norms, the quest for individuality has become increasingly complex and fraught with challenges. As traditional structures dissolve, individuals have become exposed to a world marked by ambiguity and existential uncertainty. To realize oneself, the struggle for identity, and to be oneself have become existentialist issues in today\u2019s world. The tension between the desire for self-expression and the pressures of societal conformity often leads to a profound sense of dislocation, particularly among adolescents and young adults. These and similar topics have become significant subject matters and themes in literature. \u201cA&P\u201d (1961) by John Updike and \u201cTeenage Wasteland\u201d (1983) by Anne Tyler are the two short stories delving into the themes of identity, self-actualization, adolescence, social nonconformity, alienation, expressing oneself freely and the desire for independence along with developing an attitude against all kinds of restrictions. This study aims to explore the hardships of becoming an individual and creating a self of one\u2019s own in a contemporary context as reflected in stories in question. The factors affecting personal identities and making the formation of identity difficult, particularly in adolescence, will be explored by the main characters, Sammy and Donny in \u201cA&P\u201d and \u201cTeenage Wasteland\u201d respectively. By making use of the theoretical perspectives on the concept of individualism and the constitution of the individual in the postmodern context, these two characters will be analysed as the representations of the self in the contemporary world in order to reveal the profound implications of the challenges for personal agency, realization of oneself and becoming oneself.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines whether groups can and should be self-interpreting agents. It seems that at least groups based on shared interests, \u2018interest groups\u2019, and groups providing a collective identity, \u2018identity groups\u2019, would prima facie benefit from becoming self-interpreting. This is a claim which is reflected both in political philosophy and analyses of group agency. In this paper we evaluate this claim, first, by providing a taxonomy of groups regarding their capabilities for self-interpretation. Second, we outline six reasons why non-self-interpreting groups should become self-interpreting. Third, we argue that only properly organized groups, and not looser self-interpretive groupings, can reliably avoid attribution and legitimacy issues regarding their self-interpretations. Fourth, we assess the desirability of forming self-interpretive groups by identifying theoretical, economic, social, and political costs that are typically involved in becoming a self-interpreting group agent, and argue that in some cases the costs are high enough to outweigh the reasons for becoming a genuinely self-interpreting group. Thus, despite the prima facie case, it is not always clear whether identity-groups and interest-groups should become self-interpreting. The answer in different cases hangs on the balance of costs and benefits. We finish with a brief discussion of two objections, and a short reflection.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The Zhuangzi, a 4th century BCE Chinese text, is optimistic about life unrestrained by entrenched values. This paper contributes to existing debates on Zhuangzian freedom in three ways. First, it reflects on how it is possible to enjoy the freedom envisaged in the Zhuangzi. Many discussions welcome the Zhuangzi\u2019s picture of release from life shaped by canonical visions, without also giving thought to life without these driving visions. Consider this scenario: in a world with limitless possibilities, would it not be fraught, not knowing how to interpret situations? I suggest that freedom in the Zhuangzi is possible only if one succeeds in reorienting herself to the new \u2018normal\u2019. Second, I introduce and develop the idea of working with constraints. This focuses on an agent's maximizing the fit between relevant conditions, on the one hand, and their capabilities, on the other. Finally, I propose that self-directed practice, an important expression of agency, is required for building capabilities that enable such freedom. I examine the idea of risk involved in these firsthand experiences, articulating an account of agency that sits at the heart of hard-won Zhuangzian freedom.",
