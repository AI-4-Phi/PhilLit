      "entry_name": "content-externalism",
      "snippet": "In the philosophy of mind, externalism is the view that what is going on in an individual\u2019s mind is not (entirely) determined by what is going on inside her body, including her brain. Externalism comes in two principal forms: externalism about mental content and externalism about the vehicles or bearers of that content. The latter form of externalism is commonly known as the extended mind.",

      "snippet": "Embodied Cognition is a wide-ranging research program drawing from and inspiring work in psychology, neuroscience, ethology, philosophy, linguistics, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Whereas traditional cognitive science also encompasses these disciplines, it finds common purpose in a conception of mind wedded to computationalism: mental processes are computational processes; the brain, qua computer, is the seat of cognition.",

      "snippet": "Where Fodor (1983, 2000) draws the line of modularity at the relatively low-level systems underlying perception and language, post-Fodorian theorists such as Sperber (2002) and Carruthers (2006) contend that the mind is modular through and through, up to and including the high-level systems responsible for reasoning, planning, decision making, and the like.",

      "snippet": "Clark and Chalmers (1998) and Clark (2001, 2005, 2008) have argued that mental representations may exist entirely \u201coutside the head.\u201d On their view, which they call \u201cactive externalism,\u201d cognitive processes (e.g., calculation) may be realized in external media (e.g., a calculator or pen and paper), and the \u201ccoupled system\u201d of the individual mind and the external workspace ought to count as a cognitive system \u2013 a mind \u2013in its own right. Symbolic representations on external media would thus count as mental representations. Clark and Chalmers\u2019s paper has inspired a burgeoning literature on extended, embodied and interactive cognition.",
