It argues that the suspension presupposes a theocentric anthropology in which humanity\u2019s telos finds fulfilment in relationship with God. In performing the suspension, the individual fulfils their telos. The argument develops by situating the suspension within Kierkegaard\u2019s broader authorship.\n Either/Or\n ,\n Repetition\n , and\n Fear and Trembling\n are analysed as interconnected works that trace\n Stages on Life\u2019s Way\u2019s\n existential trajectory, where one moves from the aesthetic to the ethical and finally to the religious stage. Each transition occurs through a negation of the self and resulting despair. The aesthetic life fails because it grounds identity in externality, thereby undermining authenticity. The ethical life fails because it detaches duty from the person, once again denying authenticity. Initiated by the teleological suspension, the religious stage occurs when the self relates directly to God, achieving authenticity. To achieve authenticity, however, the religious stage must presuppose a theocentric anthropology in which one\u2019s telos finds fulfilment in relation to God. It does so because only within such an anthropology does an individual gain authenticity and avoid the despair of the earlier stages by performing the suspension.\n",

      "abstract": "Introduction S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\u2019s philosophy, particularly his exploration of anxiety, serves as a cornerstone in existential thought. His concepts of \u201cauthenticity,\u201d \u201cchoice,\u201d and the confrontation with the self underlie much of the contemporary understanding of anxiety as both a psychological and philosophical experience. Kierkegaard\u2019s works, especially Either/Or, offer a profound analysis of human freedom, responsibility, and the resulting anxiety. The objective of this analysis is to bridge the philosophical with the practical and artistic, providing a multidimensional understanding of anxiety. Objectives This study seeks to explore Kierkegaard\u2019s conceptualization of anxiety, its application in psychotherapy, and its resonance in contemporary culture. Specifically, it investigates how these ideas can aid individuals in confronting existential anxiety in therapeutic settings. Methods A philosophical and qualitative approach is used, analyzing Kierkegaard\u2019s Either/Or. The study incorporates interpretations from existential thinkers, psychotherapists and artists. Theoretical analysis is coupled with psychological insights, exploring anxiety as a pathway to self-awareness. Results Kierkegaard presents anxiety as inherent to human freedom and choice. His stages of life\u2014the aesthetic, ethical, and religious\u2014represent different ways of engaging with anxiety. In the aesthetic stage, individuals pursue pleasure but encounter despair when they confront their limitations. The ethical stage offers structure but introduces existential guilt. The religious stage, requiring a leap of faith, is seen as the highest form of existence, where anxiety leads to transcendence. Kierkegaard\u2019s ideas are reflected in existential psychotherapy, where anxiety is viewed not only as a symptom but as a catalyst for personal growth. Elliott Smith\u2019s Either/Or album mirrors these themes, portraying modern struggles with freedom, despair, and self-doubt. Songs like \u201cBetween the Bars\u201d and \u201cBallad of Big Nothing\u201d articulate the tension between aesthetic escape and ethical responsibility, offering a visceral interpretation of Kierkegaard\u2019s philosophical concerns. Conclusions Kierkegaard\u2019s exploration of anxiety offers profound insights into human existence, emphasizing the need to confront, rather than avoid, existential dilemmas. His framework of life stages provides a guide for understanding the progression toward authenticity, where anxiety is a key driver. The study shows that Kierkegaard\u2019s ideas remain relevant in psychotherapy, helping individuals navigate anxiety to achieve self-realization. Ultimately, this research affirms that embracing anxiety is crucial for personal freedom, growth, and authenticity, aligning with Kierkegaard\u2019s vision of a life well-lived.

      "abstract": "Soren Kierkegaard\u2019s Lutheran existentialism represents a distinctively postmetaphysical philosophy of religion, focused in particular on a Christian vision of ethical authenticity. His philosophy continues to pose challenging questions for postmetaphysical philosophers in contemporary pluralistic settings. Focusing on specific works of Kierkegaard, this essay develops three such questions: (1) Can philosophy in a postmetaphysical vein still give advice for the pursuit of the good life, today\u2019s diversity of life styles and values notwithstanding? (2) How can a postmetaphysical philosophy relate to the ethical teachings and truth claims of religious doctrines? (3) Is postmetaphysical philosophy still capable of an \u201cupbuilding and awakening\u201d discourse that can induce and stabilize an ethical self-consciousness?",

Also, this work explores how a person's encounter with mortality can act as a catalyst for creating a meaningful existence, drawing on the philosophical traditions of existentialism. The essay explores philosophical viewpoints from thinkers like Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus, suggesting that accepting freedom, negotiating with the absurd, and deliberately forming one's narrative identity are the paths to self-creation and authenticity. In order to help people incorporate death awareness into their lives in a coherent way, like we will see in Heidegger, and without giving up on this personal project, it also looks at the therapeutic potential of irony and philosophical counseling. In spite of life's inherent uncertainties, the work seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of how existential therapy can enable people to face death, create a coherent sense of self, and live ethically.",

      "abstract": "Abstract:O. E. R\u00f6lvaag's Giants in the Earth is usually read as a novel about immigrant homesteading and Norwegian ethnicity, but the novel also situates problems of religious faith against the prairie frontier in its conflict between the pioneer Per Hansa and his wife, Beret. Seeking to reconcile these diverse themes, this article suggests that Giants is about the modern self. Drawing upon Charles Taylor's A Secular Age, it analyzes Beret and Per Hansa as types of premodern and modern selves, their conflict an interrogation of modern secular self-reliance. It then applies S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's argument for the need for God to Per Hansa and Beret to evaluate the authenticity of both selves. Kierkegaard suggests that Per Hansa is inauthentic because he worships unacknowledged gods outside himself but that Beret's spiritual paralysis is equally compromised. This conclusion implies that Giants is best understood as a sustained irresolution about the authenticity of both premodernity and modernity, which broadens its scope and enriches other approaches to the novel.",

      "abstract": "The 19th century represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity, as the Enlightenment\u2019s rational, universal self gave way to complex, relational, and socially embedded conceptions. This article traces the transformation of identity across philosophy, literature, sociology, and emerging psychology. Romantic thinkers such as Rousseau and Wordsworth emphasized emotional authenticity, while nationalist and industrial theorists including Herder, Mazzini, Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel highlighted collective, class-based, and structural dimensions of selfhood. Gender theorists Wollstonecraft and Mill argued for socially constructed identities, prefiguring feminist and queer thought. Existentialist and psychological innovations by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, James, Cooley, and Freud further explored the performative, divided, and unconscious aspects of the self. By synthesizing these intellectual currents, the article demonstrates how 19th-century debates laid the groundwork for modern social and psychological theories of identity, highlighting the interplay between individual agency and social structure.",
