      "abstract": "In this short book, Mellema examines the phenomenon of complicity in wrongdoing, that is, the phenomenon of being an accomplice to a principal agent causing harm. He also examines related phenomena such as collective and shared responsibility, as well as enabling, facilitating, and condoning harm produced by others. An agent is an accomplice to a principal agent\u2019s wrongdoing if she contributes to the outcome in certain ways. According to Mellema, she must not only perform some kind of contributory action or intentionally omit to perform an action. She must also be aware of the principal agent\u2019s wrongdoing. An accomplice may share in the responsibility for the outcome of the principal agent\u2019s wrongdoing. In part, whether she does share in it depends on the nature of the contributory action or omission. In the absence of a valid excuse, she is also always morally blameworthy for her contributory action or omission itself. Mellema draws on Thomas Aquinas\u2019 discussion of \u201caccessory sins\u201d to characterise different kinds of contributory actions or omissions. As Mellema plausibly argues, these accessory sins can be understood as ways in which one can become complicit in someone else\u2019s wrongdoing. For example, one can become complicit in another\u2019s wrongdoing in virtue of commanding, counselling, or encouraging them with respect to their wrongdoing, or in virtue of consenting to, not denouncing, or in participating in their wrong doing. If I merely encourage you to shoplift, then I am normally not responsible for the shopkeeper\u2019s loss after your theft, but if I rather actively participate in your shoplifting by distracting the security guard as you stuff your pockets, then I am also responsible for the shopkeeper\u2019s loss. Drawing on Appiah\u2019s (1991) work, Mellema argues that in the former kind of case, an accomplice can nevertheless be \u201cmorally tainted\u201d by a wrongdoing even if she is not responsible for it. This moral taint effects her moral status negatively in virtue of her being associated or related to the principal agent is certain ways. Mellema illustrates the idea of moral taint with an example case taken from Kutz (2000, pp. 163\u2013164). The case involves a pacifist employee who works on a project for the United States Department of Defense. According to Mellema, the",

      "abstract": "This study examines the politics of irony and moral resistance in J. M. Coetzee\u2019s Age of Iron focusing on role of irony in both a narrative and ethical strategy to critique apartheid South Africa. Through textual and thematic analysis, supported by the theories of irony, ethics and humanism the research particularly explores how Coetzee employs irony to expose racial violence, moral complicity, and the possibility of human transformation. The novel\u2019s protagonist, Mrs. Elizabeth Curren, embodies Coetzee\u2019s moral vision as she confronts her own complicity and gradually develops empathy toward the marginalized black population. Based on the notions of the \u201csaid and unsaid\u201d this paper illuminates how irony destabilizes dominant discourse, while humanism and ethics of responsibility underscore the novel\u2019s call for moral awakening through recognition of the other. The analysis reveals that Coetzee\u2019s irony bridges the divide between fiction and history, transforming personal suffering into a collective ethical inquiry. Ultimately, Age of Iron stands as a moral allegory of guilt, empathy, and redemption, demonstrating that literature can act as a historical intervention, one that exposes injustice, challenges indifference, and reaffirms shared humanity in the face of oppression.",

      "abstract": "White ignorance is a form of collective denial that aggressively resists acknowledging the role of race and racism. It dominates our political landscape, warps white moral frameworks and affective responses, intervenes in white self-conceptions, and organizes white identities. In this way, white ignorance poses a problem for conceptions of responsibility that rely on individuals\u2019 intentions, causal contributions, or knowledge of the facts. As Eva Boodman shows, our moral concepts for responding to racism are implicated in the process of racialization when they understand responsibility as the attribution of blame or absolution, innocence or guilt. White Ignorance and Complicit Responsibility challenges these binary, punitive moralities, arguing that they reproduce racial harm by encouraging white people to seek innocence and the purification of moral taint instead of addressing the material conditions of racial harm. Instead, Boodman claims the space of complicity as a place of anti-racist possibility. Linking the construction of whiteness to a racist punishment paradigm, this book makes the case for a different way of responding to harm as necessary for dismantling the moral, racial, political, and affective constructs that keep racial capitalism in place.",

      "abstract": "How do poems communicate moral ideas? Can they express concepts in ways that are unique and impossible to replicate in other forms of writing? This book explores these questions by turning to two of the late twentieth century\u2019s most important poets: Seamus Heaney and Geoffrey Hill. Their work shows that a poem can act as an example of a moral concept, rather than simply a description or discussion of it. Exploring these two poets via their shared preoccupation with poetry\u2019s moral exemplarity opens up new perspectives on their work. The concept of exemplarity plays an important role in these poets\u2019 key preoccupations, from moral complicity to the nature of lyric speech to influence to memorialization, responsibility, and aesthetic autonomy. Through this analysis of critical prose, drama, and archival materials as well as poetry, this book offers a groundbreaking study of ethics in the later writings of these two poets, including recent and underexplored posthumous works. In turn, the book also makes an important intervention in larger debates about literature and morality, and about the field of ethical criticism itself: this is the first book-length study to expand ethical criticism beyond its customary narrative focus. So far, the ethical criticism of fiction has largely been an exercise in methodological advocacy, urging the use of more literary examples in moral philosophy. As this book shows, including poetry among these examples introduces new, lyric-inflected caveats about the use of literature as a form of moral example: caveats which remain invisible in narrative-centred ethical criticism.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper explores how pedagogically productive the idea of invoking feelings of collective guilt in classrooms might be. It attempts to explore not only the persistence of \u2018collective guilt\u2019 in students\u2019 responses, but also new possibilities that are opened when \u2018collective guilt\u2019 is reframed as \u2018shared responsibility\u2019. The analysis addresses the moral, political and pedagogical implications of viewing the phenomena of collective guilt and shared responsibility through the lenses of Hannah Arendt and Iris Marion Young. The paper suggests that, using Arendt\u2019s and Young\u2019s accounts of shared responsibility offers educators and students opportunities to become aware of their responsibilities as members of particular social groups, rather than getting stuck in guilt. The proposed pedagogy of shared responsibility is not focused on blame, guilt or fault, but rather it has the potential to minimize denials of complicity and instead encourage students to interrogate the conditions under which they are responsive and responsible to others.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the concept of complicity. The basic question is whether complicity is a crime in and of itself or a way of assisting another person to commit a crime. On the whole, the idea of complicity in the actions of another has become a standard part of modern legal and moral thought. One no longer thinks of individuals acting solely on their own account but of groups of people interacting in order to produce a crime of shared responsibility. This is particularly true in the crimes of genocide, aggression, and crimes against humanity. As for holding individual actors accountable, as Article 25 of the Rome Statute attempts to do, it would make sense to hold each liable for their causal role in the crime. That is, complicity should be seen not as a crime in itself but as a contribution to the crime of another.",

Moral responsibility is concerned with a defendant\u2019s eligibility for moral praise or blame in respect of her behaviour. Ascriptive responsibility, by contrast is concerned with the conditions of accountability. The latter is audience-relative: the former is not. Within the criminal law, denials of moral responsibility are accommodated through defences such as infancy and insanity, and by the requirement of voluntariness. Denials of ascription, by contrast, turn primarily upon doctrines of causation, omissions, and complicity. The chapter concludes with a critique of the so-called voluntary act requirement.",
