      "abstract": "The modern world is undergoing a rapid digital transformation, leading to a new content in human rights theory. While human rights used to be viewed as universal moral and legal principles aimed at protecting dignity, freedom and equality, today digitalization, the development of artificial intelligence, biotechnology and global networking require a rethinking of these principles in the new environment. The growing dependence of individuals on digital platforms, the widespread use of personal data, and the emergence of algorithmic control over decision-making all call into question the ability of traditional legal systems to effectively protect human rights in the new context (Wong, 2023). Particular attention should be paid to the study of fourth-generation rights, which include not only digital rights, but also cognitive and epistemic rights related to autonomy of thought, protection from manipulative influence, access to reliable information, and participation in knowledge creation (Klang & Murray, 2016). In addition, no less important are bioethical rights, which are being formed in response to the development of reproductive technologies, medical genetics, and the right to a dignified death. All of these areas are gradually shaping a new paradigm of legal thinking that combines digital autonomy with the moral and ethical challenges of the digital age. Importantly, these rights mostly remain in the realm of doctrinal developments and do not have proper legal consolidation, and the absence of a single international legal act that would systematize the human rights of the new generation indicates the need for further theoretical reflection and normative unification.",

      "abstract": "Considering the overall shortage of therapists to meet the psychological needs of vulnerable populations, AI-based technologies are often seen as a possible remedy. Particularly smartphone apps or chatbots are increasingly used to offer mental health support, mostly through cognitive behavioral therapy. The assumption underlying the deployment of these systems is their ability to make mental health support accessible to generally underserved populations. Hence, this seems to be aligned with the fundamental biomedical principle of justice understood in its distributive meaning. However, considerations of the principle of justice in its epistemic significance are still in their infancy in the debates revolving around the ethical issues connected to the use of mental health chatbots. This paper aims to fill this research gap, focusing on a less familiar kind of harm that these systems can cause, namely the harm to users in their capacities as knowing subjects. More specifically, we frame our discussion in terms of one form of epistemic injustice that such practices are especially prone to bring about, i.e., participatory injustice. To make our theoretical analysis more graspable and to show its urgency, we discuss the case of a mental health Chatbot, Karim, deployed to deliver mental health support to Syrian refugees. This case substantiates our theoretical considerations and the epistemo-ethical concerns arising from the use of mental health applications among vulnerable populations. Finally, we argue that conceptualizing epistemic participation as a capability within the framework of Capability Sensitive Design can be a first step toward ameliorating the participatory injustice discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "The quest to eliminate uncertainty in clinical decision making has become central to biomedical research over the past 50 years, driving the emergence of evidence-based medicine, precision medicine, and most recently, biomedical artificial intelligence. This quest is unsurprising given that uncertainty discomforts most humans, who have cognitive and emotional drives to eliminate it from their decisions. When physicians are uncertain about how a condition will progress or respond to treatment, they can feel like they let patients down and fail to have the predictive ability they desire. Paradoxically, however, the very uncertainty that creates this discomfort can have an important positive effect on medical care, particularly the trust between patients and their physicians, hospitals, and health care systems. Trust is the belief that another person or entity will act in your interest in the future (1). Both interpersonal trust (that is, between a patient and physician) and institutional trust (that is, between a patient and hospital or health care system) are critical for the functioning of health care, including patient engagement with providers and adherence to recommendations. Building trust is particularly important for groups with a history of negative experiences with health care, such as racial or ethnic minorities. We know intuitively that trust is only necessary when an important adverse outcome is possible. For example, trust is often invoked for decisions in health care and government but is largely irrelevant for choosing lunch or clothes. Perhaps less intuitively, trust also requires uncertainty about the likelihood of these high-stakes outcomes (2). Belief that someone will act in your interest becomes necessary only if the future is uncertain and may be influenced by those actions. This dependence of trust on uncertainty has been demonstrated in experimental studies. One study of hypothetical purchasing decisions varied the amount of information given to the buyer, creating a scenario with considerable uncertainty about the quality of the good and a scenario with no uncertainty. As hypothesized, after multiple purchases, the buyer reported higher levels of trust in the seller in the high-uncertainty scenario than in the low-uncertainty scenario (3). Similarly, other experiments have compared exchanges based on negotiated contracts that minimize uncertainty about future actions with those based on reciprocal relationships that have inherent uncertainty. Trust was again higher in the setting with more uncertainty (4). What does this mean for medicine? Advances in biomedical research will continue to improve the accuracy of information available for clinical decision making, but uncertainty in clinical medicine is unlikely to disappear any time soon. In fact, by describing the breadth of human variation, these advances have highlighted the enormity of such a task (5). Given this reality, building trust remains critically important. Although evidence suggests that recognizing intrinsic uncertainty may help rather than harm this effort, many physicians are uncomfortable sharing uncertainty with their patients. We worry that admitting our limited ability to predict the likelihood of different outcomes, the implications of a test result, or the optimal therapy for a specific patient will lead to a loss of patient confidence. Although uncertainty is uncomfortable, at least 1 study suggests that appropriate expressions of uncertainty can lead to stronger physicianpatient relationships. In that study, primary care encounters where the physician used direct expressions of uncertainty, such as I don't know or It's not clear, had higher levels of positive talk, patient engagement, and patient satisfaction (6). Hiding uncertainty can also have a large downside. Patients frequently access many sources of information about their medical care, particularly for high-stakes decisions. If a second opinion or an Internet site suggests that a physician has withheld information about a decision, the patient may question the physician's competency or honesty, including whether financial motives outweighed the patient's interest. Trust is fragile, and concerns about competency, honesty, and motives are key steps toward loss of interpersonal trust (7). Such events can also threaten institutional trust in the health care system. The fallout from the changing recommendations about mammography screening for women in their 40s illustrates how betrayed patients feel by health care institutions when the decision turns out not to be so certain (8). Thus, the question is not whether to share uncertainty with our patients, but how best to share it to create trust instead of unnecessary anxiety. Although research indicates that communicating uncertainty is challenging, some principles can be helpful. Such communication is most effective when embedded within an empathetic, positive, and partnering relationship (9). Theoretically, it becomes easier and more effective over time as the physicianpatient relationship strengthens. Evidence about the prevalence of low numeracy and cognitive biases argues against using potentially misleading levels of precision, even when such numbers are available (10). For example, the likelihood of a response to therapy can be expressed as a numerical range with a qualitative estimate rather than a single number. Similarly, life expectancy can be explained as having weeks not months or months not years left. For most diagnostic tests, we should emphasize that the test result shifts the probability of a particular diagnosis up or down rather than providing a definitive answer. Finally, the greatest comfort to a patient can be hearing that, regardless of clinical uncertainty, their physician will be with them no matter what the future brings. Despite the remarkable trajectory of biomedical research over recent decades, uncertainty will always be part of clinical medicine. Fortunately, accepting and communicating that uncertainty may strengthen a patient's trust in their physician and even in the health care systema step that is critically needed today.",

      "abstract": "THE LIFE WE'RE LOOKING FOR: Reclaiming Relationship in a Technological World by Andy Crouch. New York: Convergent Books, 2022. 226 pages, including notes. Hardcover; $25.00. ISBN: 9780593237342. *In The Life We're Looking For, subtitled Reclaiming Relationship in a Technological World, author Andy Crouch examines modern Western life given the ubiquity of and our dependence on technology. This is not a book about technology--you will not learn anything new about the Internet, your cellphone, or AI. Instead, you will be asked to examine life in this modern age rife with loneliness, how we got here, and what we can do about it. *The book is divided into three sections: six chapters identifying the problems of the modern age, a one-chapter \"intermission,\" and five chapters identifying solutions to the problems. The problems of this world can be summarized by the subtitles of the first six chapters: \"The Loneliness of a Personalized World,\" \"What We've Forgotten about Being a Person,\" \"How We Trade Personhood for Effortless Power,\" \"The Ancient Roots of Our Tech Obsession,\" \"How Impersonal Power Rules Our World,\" and \"Why the Next Tech Revolution Will Succeed--and Also Fail.\" *One of Crouch's major themes is that our modern conveniences promise us superpowers. This sounds like a good thing, but in reality it is not. Cars, trains, and planes allow us to move great distances quickly with little effort. Our cell phones give us the ability to translate languages, access vast amounts of information, and communicate almost instantaneously with people around the world. Even our household devices allow us to clean our house without any effort. How these devices work is, for most of us, indistinguishable from magic. Yet, having these abilities leaves us without the need for relationships, and without the need for long-term investment in a project or craft--such as learning a foreign language or learning to play an instrument. We lack the need (and ability?) to love with our full heart, soul, mind, and strength. We are allowed to skim across the surface of life instead of diving deep into it. *Another major theme of the book is Crouch's definition of Mammon. In Matthew 6:24, Jesus says, \"You cannot serve both God and Mammon.\" Crouch expands Mammon from a concept to a being. Mammon is the demonic creature that rules the world. \"\u2026 What [Mammon] wants, above all, is to separate power from relationship, abundance from dependence, and being from personhood\" (p. 76). Mammon and money are closely related, for money makes possible \"the ability to get things done, often by means of other persons, without the entanglements of friendship\" (p. 72). Crouch then ties in technology: \"What technology wants is really what Mammon wants: a world of context-free, responsibility-free, dependence-free power measured out in fungible, storable units of value\" (p. 78). *In the \"intermission\" chapter, Crouch takes us to the table of Gaius, in Corinth, in the second century AD. Around the table are seated wealthy and powerful men, scribes, slaves, and women, and, notably, Paul the apostle. These people share a meal together as equals. They pray and sing together. This is radically counter-cultural. Their actions acknowledge that all people are recognized as persons--image bearers of God. *To solve the problems highlighted in the first part of the book, the author proposes that we need to influence the world, not impact it. \"Impact\" implies applying a great force for a short period of time. \"Influence\" implies relationship, patience, and a slower pace. We should seek to use and create technology as an instrument that enhances personhood, does not promise short-term, instant gratification, and elevates and dignifies personhood. *Crouch identifies the promises made by technology: (1) \"Now you'll be able to \u2026,\" and (2) \"You'll no longer have to \u2026\" (p. 139). He encourages us to think carefully about what these promises are and how true they are. He then identifies the negative consequences of adopting a given technology: (3) \"You'll no longer be able to \u2026,\" and (4) \"Now you'll have to \u2026\" He then illustrates these promises and consequences with music, available ubiquitously now due to smartphones and the internet, and listened to on earbuds or headphones: (1) Now you'll be able to listen to anything, anywhere. (2) You'll no longer have to listen to others' music in a shared space. (3) You'll no longer be able to make time to practice an instrument so that you can make your own music. (4) Now you'll have to keep upgrading your phone/device/provider so you can get all the best music (p. 140). *To address the epidemic of loneliness, Crouch proposes we should all live in \"households\". Households are not just families, which may live thousands of miles apart. Households are groups of people sharing life together in community--living, eating, \"doing life\" together. A household means knowing where each person is and how each person is feeling that day. Crouch goes further, suggesting that we should stop seeking the \"blessed\" life, which he renames the \"charmed\" life, free from suffering and burden. Instead, we should include in our communities the \"unuseful\" person--the person who cannot contribute as much to the financial support of the community, due to age, (dis)ability, or health. To do so will change our hearts from desiring a charmed life to desiring to be a blessing. Moreover, it will radically acknowledge the full personhood of these others. *Andy Crouch gives compelling evidence for what he sees is wrong with life in Western society today. The book is full of wise observations--I have highlighted a sentence or two, if not a full paragraph, on most pages. I found his advice for positively influencing our world to be compelling and practical. His \"treatment plan\" for addressing loneliness was the most challenging for me. As an introvert, I like and need alone time. I'm not sure I could live under one roof with many other unrelated people. Still, the idea is noble, if perhaps impractical for many people. *I highly recommend this book. It is an easy read, and, more importantly, it will make you think. *Reviewed by Victor Norman, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Calvin University, Grand Rapids, MI 49546.",

      "abstract": "Theologians and philosophers have historically privileged the faculty of rationality in their exegesis of what it means to be created in the image of God. They have argued that we were made in God\u2019s image when we were endowed with a rational soul. This argument is contested by contemporary disability theologians. They argue that by equating the imago Dei with the faculty of rationality Christian theology effectively strips people with cognitive disabilities of their human rights. It justifies elevating the cognitively able over the cognitively disabled in the same way that it justifies elevating the human species over other species. In this article, I will first show that the contemporary Western conviction that ability and independence are normal while disability and dependence are deviant owes much to definitions of the human first proposed by Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, and Immanuel Kant. I will then propose that Aquinas himself offers us a way out of these destructive binarisms. He defines the imago Dei as an embodied soul, an imperfectly intelligent substance that can fulfill its destiny only if it receives the support of society and the intervention of God\u2019s grace. Aquinas\u2019s theology of embodiment does not merely expose false assumptions about ability and disability; it compels us to appreciate the radical dependency and vulnerability of human nature.",

      "abstract": "The article stands in the position of theoretical psychology, and exploresthe possible relationship between cognition and the body from the dimensions of the body. The article points out that, dualism has always dominated Western culture since ancient Greece. Plato is the earliest representative of the dualism thought. Descartes confirms the existence of the binary world of mind and matter from epistemology.Traditional cognitive psychology inherits the dualistic tradition of separation of mind and body, and regards the mind as the processing of abstract symbolic informationindependent of the body s sensory movement system. But the rise of personal cognition challenges the dualism. From the perspective of the body, cognition is the cognition of the body, and the body is the subject of cognition. Cognition shows dependence on the body in three ways: a. The body limits the characteristics and scope of cognition. The body structure of the organism and the ability of the body is limiting the nature and content of cognitive representation; b. The body not only limits cognitive processing, but also can be used as an integral part of cognitive processing to distribute cognitive tasks between the brain and the body, playing a role similar to a distributor; c. The body regulates cognition, affecting mental processessuch as thinking, judgment, emotion, and motivation. The above facts show that mind and body are not binary, but one and the interaction between body and environment create mind and cognition. The mind, body, and environment are the process of integration.",

      "abstract": "One of the sources of human \u2018competitive advantage\u2019 over other animals stems from our capacity for communication and abstract thought. This allows us not only to collectively perform certain tasks but also to transfer years\u2019 worth of cumulative experience and knowledge to our children and other members of the community. This knowledge constitutes a key factor in our development: the more we acquire and learn to utilise, the faster we are able to grow. Thousands of years of history allowed humans to develop many effective methods of transferring knowledge, particularly by teaching it to others. Still, those methods are not without certain inherent limitations: they are time-consuming and highly dependent on the aptitude and motivation of the respective people involved. But even despite this fact, the dynamics of societal development, be it in the technological, economic (welfare) or social dimension (level of education, health, value systems) remains staggeringly high. But let us imagine structures that would (1) have the ability to gather and process considerably larger amounts of information from a far broader spectrum of stimuli than that available to humans, (2) be able to extract knowledge therefrom and learn from the experiences gained and (3) have the capacity to instantaneously and reliably transfer the same to all members of their community. As soon as any one of the thousands of elements comprising such a structure were to learn a certain skill, all other members thereof would also gain access to the same. And if a certain mistake were made and then successfully remedied in a given situation, all members would learn the ability to avoid it in the future. How quickly would such a structure be able to develop? And what would be the direction of its evolution? For years, artificial intelligence (AI) has excited the imaginations of science fiction writers and business managers alike. On the one hand, there are many hopes for potential future benefits, and on the other, exaggerated fears of less than welcome repercussions. Optimists see it as a chance for accelerated growth, lower production costs or improved safety. Pessimists fear the expected disappearance of job opportunities, excessive dependence on technology, deterioration of human cognitive abilities, a world controlled by elites with exclusive access to intelligent technologies and ultimately ripped from our grasp by AI itself. Meanwhile, researchers are busy looking for new",

      "abstract": "in Amsterdam in 2014. Somov argues that Luke presents a range of conflicting ideas about the afterlife, and sets out to account for the apparently incompatible views that he finds in Luke-Acts. The author identifies four general headings under which to discuss pertinent passages in Luke and Acts. The first is Luke\u2019s eschatology, which Somov breaks down further to Luke\u2019s depiction of collective eschatology and the last judgement and his depiction of individual eschatology and postmortem judgement. Second, he considers Luke\u2019s various representations of the abode of the dead, both those who were considered righteous and those who were not. His third topic is resurrection (sub-divided into eschatological resurrection, individual resurrection and the resuscitation of the dead) and his fourth is the immortality of the soul and celestial and angelomorphic conceptions of the afterlife. In each case he considers how these topics feature in a range of pagan and Jewish sources that might have influenced Luke (in the sense that they were part of his cultural milieu, so that direct literary dependence is not required) before noting how some of these different beliefs have parallels in Luke-Acts. This is an important methodological move, for it sets the scene for how Somov accounts for the diversity of views that he finds in Luke and Acts: Luke shares and reflects the range of views and traditions that result when a large number of pagan and Jewish texts are brought together and used as evidence of \u2018the diversity and incoherence of the common beliefs and traditions that he inherited from his cultural-religious milieu.\u2019 Luke appears to reflect incompatible beliefs because he draws on a range of incompatible ideas, but (and here the argument shifts) he does not in fact simply reflect uncritically what he finds in those sources. Rather, because Luke\u2019s own religious conceptual system is predominantly metaphorical (in support of which claims Somov draws on cognitive metaphor theory and on cognitive linguistics), he uses different ideas, images and language in a metaphorical way, in a way that is suited for his own purposes and context. Thus, according to Somov (if I follow him correctly) Luke did not set out to provide an integrated eschatological model. Nevertheless, some coherence can be found within a framework that is shaped by Luke\u2019s views on eschatology and judgement, but allows for the transference of future eschatology into the present, and emphasizes the importance of individual eschatology because of Luke\u2019s understanding of repentance and salvation. One strength of Somov\u2019s work is the large number of primary sources on which he draws in order to set out the range of ideas to which Luke may have had access through his religious cultural milieu. Another is his treatment of many different passages in Luke-Acts, and his willingness to recognise apparent differences between them rather than to force them into one constrictive framework. But questions may be asked about whether Somov\u2019s account of Luke\u2019s method really explains rather than simply describes what Luke may have done in the passages in which he treats issues to do with the afterlife, and about how his claim that Luke is so readily influenced by incoherent sources fits with other estimations of his ability and creativity as an author. Somov\u2019s suggestion of how to account for apparent discrepancies in Luke\u2019s presentation of the afterlife is less convincing (and much more difficult to follow) than his account of the tensions in Luke\u2019s account.",
