Second, is it advantageous to diversify search strategies? We argue pace Weisberg and Muldoon, \u201cEpistemic Landscapes and the Division of Cognitive Labor\u201d (this journal, 2009), that, on the first question, a search strategy that deliberately seeks novel research approaches need not be optimal. On the second question, we argue they have not shown epistemic reasons exist for the division of cognitive labor, identifying the errors that led to their conclusions. Furthermore, we generalize the epistemic landscape model, showing that one should be skeptical about the benefits of social learning in epistemically complex environments.",

Issue specialization improves decisions by instantiating a cognitive division of labor among the mass public, which creates efficiencies in decision making and grants large groups of average citizens a scalable advantage over small groups of even the smartest and most capable individuals. Issue specialization further improves decisions by capturing issue\u2010specific information, concentrating it within the specialized deliberative enclaves of issue publics, and refining citizens\u2019 issue preferences. These advantages are brought to bear in wider democratic politics and policy through information shortcuts and through the specialized electoral incentives of representatives. The article responds to concerns about political ignorance, polarization/partisanship, rent seeking, and socioeconomic bias and argues that issue specialization can provide a valuable brake to polarization yet needs institutional supplementation to engage marginalized citizens and combat bias.",

      "abstract": "The unequal division of cognitive labor within households, and its potential association with mental load and stress, has gained substantial interest in recent public and scholarly discussions. We aim to deepen this debate theoretically and empirically. First, going beyond the question of whether the division of cognitive labor is gendered, we connect cognitive household labor with existing stress theories and ask whether men and women typically perform cognitive labor tasks that involve different levels of stress. We then discuss whether women perform these stressful tasks more often, making them more prone to higher levels of family\u2013work conflict. Second, we test the association between the division of cognitive labor and family\u2013work conflict empirically using large-scale survey data from 10 European countries within the Generations & Gender Programme (GGP). Results based on logistic regressions confirm that a high share of cognitive labor increases women's family\u2013work conflict, but not men's. We discuss future directions in the conceptualization and measurement of cognitive labor in the household and its implications for mental load. Through its contributions, this paper lays the foundations for a comprehensive understanding of the implications of an unequal division of cognitive labor in the household for gender inequality.",

      "abstract": "As technology advances, people increasingly outsource cognitive tasks and can more easily access others' knowledge. While externalized aids often support human abilities, they may also make it more difficult for people to assess their own competence. Indeed, using online search engines leads people to treat searchable information as if they already know it (Fisher et al., <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology: General</i>, 2015, <i>144</i>, 674). Six primary and two supplemental studies (<i>N</i> = 3,262) extend previous research by exploring how illusions of knowledge result from reliance on other agents. After teaming with knowledgeable partners (artificially intelligent agents or human teammates) on a trivia quiz, people overestimated how well they would perform on future quizzes for which help was not available; this bias was not evident for participants who never received help. Moreover, overconfidence was insensitive to whether assistance was provided on hard versus easy problems, or even whether the assistance was accurate. Receiving outside assistance creates an ambiguity regarding who deserves credit for success or blame for failure. When this ambiguity is removed, people become better calibrated. These results indicate that reliance on technology and outside knowledge may change our view of ourselves-convincing us we are more capable than we really are.

      "abstract": "Often members of a group benefit from dividing the group\u2019s task into separate components, where each member specializes their role so as to accomplish only one of the components. While this division of labor phenomenon has been observed with respect to both manual and cognitive labor, there is no clear understanding of the cognitive mechanisms allowing for its emergence, especially when there are multiple divisions possible and communication is limited. Indeed, maximization of expected utility often does not differentiate between alternative ways in which individuals could divide labor. We developed an iterative two-person game in which there are multiple ways of dividing labor, but in which it is not possible to explicitly negotiate a division. We implemented the game both as a human experimental task and as a computational model. Our results show that the majority of human dyads can finish the game with an efficient division of labor. Moreover, we fitted our computational model to the behavioral data, which allowed us to explain how the perceived similarity between a player\u2019s actions and the task\u2019s focal points guided the players\u2019 choices from one round to the other, thus bridging the group dynamics and its underlying cognitive process. Potential applications of this model outside cognitive science include the improvement of cooperation in human groups, multi-agent systems, as well as human-robot collaboration.",

      "abstract": "Household labor is commonly defined as a set of physical tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and shopping. Sociologists sometimes reference non-physical activities related to \u201chousehold management,\u201d but these are typically mentioned in passing, imprecisely defined, or treated as equivalent to physical tasks. Using 70 in-depth interviews with members of 35 couples, this study argues that such tasks are better understood as examples of a unique dimension of housework: cognitive labor. The data demonstrate that cognitive labor entails anticipating needs, identifying options for filling them, making decisions, and monitoring progress. Because such work is taxing but often invisible to both cognitive laborers and their partners, it is a frequent source of conflict for couples. Cognitive labor is also a gendered phenomenon: women in this study do more cognitive labor overall and more of the anticipation and monitoring work in particular. However, male and female participation in decision-making, arguably the cognitive labor component most closely linked to power and influence, is roughly equal. These findings identify and define an overlooked\u2014yet potentially consequential\u2014source of gender inequality at the household level and suggest a new direction for research on the division of household labor.",

By increasing the realism of the model, we gain additional insight into the social structure of science and gain the ability to ask new questions about the optimal division of labor.",

Though not committing to any specific answer to question (1), I claim that issue (2) does not depend exclusively on an invisible hand like mechanism, since both intra-scientific and extra-scientific institutions may play a major role. Finally, I examine some practical difficulties of reallocating scientists from a method to another, which leads to stress the importance of well-planned training and recruitment.",

Arguing that heteromation is a new logic of capital accumulation, Ekbia and Nardi consider different kinds of heteromated labor: communicative labor, seen in user-generated content on social media; cognitive labor, including microwork and self-service; creative labor, from gaming environments to literary productions; emotional labor, often hidden within paid jobs; and organizing labor, made up of collaborative groups such as citizen scientists. Ekbia and Nardi then offer a utopian vision: heteromation refigured to bring end users more fully into the prosperity of capitalism.",

We aim to deepen this debate theoretically and empirically. First, going beyond the question of whether the division of cognitive labor is gendered, we connect cognitive household labor with existing stress theories and ask whether men and women typically perform cognitive labor tasks that are differently stressful. We then discuss whether women perform these stressful tasks more often, making them more prone to higher levels of family-work conflict. Second, we test these associations empirically using large-scale survey data from seven European countries within the Generations &amp;amp; Gender Programme (GGP). Our results confirm that a high share of cognitive labor increases women\u2019s family-work conflict, but not men\u2019s. We discuss future directions in the conceptualization and measurement of cognitive labor in the household and its implications for mental load. In doing so, this paper lays the foundations for a comprehensive data-driven understanding of the implications of unequal division of cognitive labor in the household for gender inequality.",

Drawing upon the literature on gender roles and conservation of resources theory, we argue that women (vs. men) are particularly drained due to undertaking a greater proportion of cognitive labor\u2014a hidden form of unpaid labor involved in managing a household\u2014leading to undermined work outcomes. Data were collected weekly (during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic) for 7 weeks in April to May 2020 ( N = 263) and aggregated. Using multilevel structural equation modeling, we found that women (vs. men) reported engaging in a disproportionate amount of cognitive labor in their households, which increased their emotional exhaustion and, in turn, was related to greater turnover intentions and lower career resilience. However, for mothers (vs. fathers), emotional exhaustion and undermined work-related outcomes were driven by disproportionate responsibility for childcare. Hence, division of cognitive labor uniquely affected work-related outcomes of women without children, whereas division of childcare shaped the work-related outcomes of women with children. Overall, this research highlights the differential challenges faced by working women with and without children and the need for gender equity initiatives focusing on both women with and without children.",

Given the scale and complexity of modern polities, however, even the most attentive citizens cannot engage knowledgeably with most of the collective decisions that affect them. For this reason, democratic theorists increasingly conceptualize democratic systems as requiring divisions of cognitive labor, in which citizens trust others to make decisions on their behalf. Modern democracies have long relied on such trustees, yet institutional supports for good trust decisions by citizens are often weak or missing. We argue that deliberative minipublics can serve as trusted information proxies that help citizens make the most of their scarce cognitive resources. These kinds of trustees cannot close the gap between the demands of complex societies and citizens' capacities for informed judgment, but they may be able to narrow it.",

These gains are not attributable to husbands' cognitive decline, as captured by cognition tests. The results are consistent with a model in which the division of labor collapses when a spouse dies: women have incentives to delay acquiring financial human capital, but also to begin learning before widowhood.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Within the cognitive sciences, most researchers assume that it is the job of linguists to investigate how language is represented, and that they do so largely by building theories based on explicit judgments about patterns of acceptability \u2013 whereas it is the task of psychologists to determine how language is processed, and that in doing so, they do not typically question the linguists' representational assumptions. We challenge this division of labor by arguing that structural priming provides an implicit method of investigating linguistic representations that should end the current reliance on acceptability judgments. Moreover, structural priming has now reached sufficient methodological maturity to provide substantial evidence about such representations. We argue that evidence from speakers' tendency to repeat their own and others' structural choices supports a linguistic architecture involving a single shallow level of syntax connected to a semantic level containing information about quantification, thematic relations, and information structure, as well as to a phonological level. Many of the linguistic distinctions often used to support complex (or multilevel) syntactic structure are instead captured by semantics; however, the syntactic level includes some specification of \u201cmissing\u201d elements that are not realized at the phonological level. We also show that structural priming provides evidence about the consistency of representations across languages and about language development. In sum, we propose that structural priming provides a new basis for understanding the nature of language.",

      "abstract": "The unequal division of unpaid labor between working women and their male partners remains a barrier to achieving workplace gender equality; women consistently bear responsibility for this \u201csecond shift\u201d and suffer career consequences as a result. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities. In addition to managing their current work and household demands, women may be disproportionately engaged in a less visible form of labor \u2013 cognitive labor \u2013 during the pandemic, which constitutes a hidden \u201cthird shift\u201d and may have consequences for women\u2019s work outcomes. Integrating theories of gender roles and conservation of resources, we theorize that women (vs. men) are responsible for a greater proportion of cognitive labor within their households during the pandemic, leading to increased emotional exhaustion and undermining work outcomes. Data (N = 263) from our main study collected weekly for eight weeks near the beginning of the pandemic reveals that women (vs. men) reported engaging in a disproportionate amount of cognitive labor, which led to increased emotional exhaustion. In turn, emotional exhaustion was related to greater turnover intentions and undermined career resilience. Further, results of a follow-up study provide additional insights into daily experiences of cognitive labor. Our findings suggest that women\u2019s heavy second and third shifts during the pandemic threaten to set back progress toward workplace gender equality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions\u2014behavioral control, declarative memory\u2014have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process\u2014a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event\u2014is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of representational content (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.",

According to this principle, unconscious processes can carry out every fundamental high-level cognitive function that conscious processes can perform. In our commentary, we argue that the author presents an overly idealized review of the literature in support of the YIC principle. Furthermore, we point out that the dissimilar trends observed in social and cognitive psychology, with respect to published evidence of strong unconscious effects, can better be explained by the way how awareness is defined and measured in both research fields. Finally, we show that the experimental paradigm chosen by Hassin to rule out remaining objections against the YIC principle is unsuited to verify the new default notion that all high-level cognitive functions can unfold unconsciously.",

Conference interpreting had become an object of study proper for researchers of cognition when translation research started focusing on the development of machine translation systems, inspired by Noam Chomsky's views on language, which exceeded his generative framework. The chapter also explains two major cognitive trends TS researchers will be adhering to in the next years: computational translatology, and cognitive translatology.",

Here, we provide an explanation of the emergence of diverse collaborative ties. The theoretical framework used for understanding research collaboration couples <i>scientific and technical human capital</i> embodied in the individual with the <i>social organization</i> and <i>cognitive characteristics</i> of the research field. We analyze survey data collected from Slovenian scientists in four scientific disciplines: mathematics; physics; biotechnology; and sociology. The results show that while individual characteristics and resources are among the strongest predictors of collaboration, very different mechanisms underlie collaboration with different kinds of partners. International collaboration is particularly important for the researchers in small national science systems. Collaboration with colleagues from various domestic organizations presents a vehicle for resource mobilization. Within organizations collaboration reflects the elaborated division of labor in the laboratories and high level of competition between different research groups. These results hold practical implications for policymakers interested in promoting quality research.",

I question these assumptions on the basis of metascientific evidence and argue that the priority rule systematically discourages replication.

We combined behavioral computational modeling and multivariate decoding of fMRI responses to identify neural loci of regulation-related shifts in value representations across goals and domains (dietary or altruistic choice). Surprisingly, regulatory goals did not alter integrative value representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which represented all choice-relevant attributes across goals and domains. Instead, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) flexibly encoded goal-consistent values and predicted regulatory success for the majority of choice-relevant attributes, using attribute-specific neural codes. We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn\u2019t) across contexts and domains.",

However, little is known about the cognitive function of the integration and segregation of brain networks. Here, we examined the well-studied brain network for face processing, and asked whether the integration and segregation of the face network (FN) are related to face recognition performance. To do so, we used a voxel-based global brain connectivity method based on resting-state fMRI to characterize the within-network connectivity (WNC) and the between-network connectivity (BNC) of the FN. We found that 95.4% of voxels in the FN had a significantly stronger WNC than BNC, suggesting that the FN is a relatively encapsulated network. Importantly, individuals with a stronger WNC (i.e., integration) in the right fusiform face area were better at recognizing faces, whereas individuals with a weaker BNC (i.e., segregation) in the right occipital face area performed better in the face recognition tasks. In short, our study not only demonstrates the behavioral relevance of integration and segregation of the FN but also provides evidence supporting functional division of labor between the occipital face area and fusiform face area in the hierarchically organized FN. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although the integration and segregation are major principles of human brain organization, little is known about whether they support the cognitive processes. By correlating the within-network connectivity (WNC) and between-network connectivity (BNC) of the face network with face recognition performance, we found that individuals with stronger WNC in the right fusiform face area or weaker BNC in the right occipital face area were better at recognizing faces. Our study not only demonstrates the behavioral relevance of the integration and segregation but also provides evidence supporting functional division of labor between the occipital face area and fusiform face area in the hierarchically organized face network.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Although the division of unpaid household labor has been studied as a driver of global gender inequity, the cognitive dimension of household labor\u2014planning, anticipating, and delegating household tasks\u2014has received less empirical investigation. Cognitive household labor represents a form of invisible and often unacknowledged domestic work that has been challenging to measure. Methods Within 322 mothers of young children, we assessed the division of both cognitive (\u201cplanning\u201d) and physical (\u201cexecution\u201d) household labor within 30 common household tasks using a self-report measure. Results We found that while mothers did more of the overall domestic labor than their partners, the division of cognitive labor was particularly gendered, such that women\u2019s share of cognitive labor was more disproportionate than physical household labor. We found that cognitive labor was associated with women\u2019s depression, stress, burnout, overall mental health, and relationship functioning. Conclusions This study is one of the first to investigate cognitive labor quantitatively, and the first to investigate cognitive and physical dimensions within the same household tasks. Understanding how cognitive labor affects mothers\u2019 mental wellbeing has important implications for both practice and policy.",
