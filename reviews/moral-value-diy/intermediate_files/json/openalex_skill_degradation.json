While the impact of AI on human resource (HR) and people management is difficult to predict, the article considers potential scenarios for how AI will affect our field. We argue that although popular accounts of AI stress the risks of bias and unfairness, these problems are eminently solvable. However, the way that the AI industry is currently constituted and wider trends in the use of technology for organising work mean that there is a significant risk that AI use will degrade the quality of work. Viewing different scenarios through a paradox lens, we argue that both positive and negative visions of the future are likely to coexist. The HR profession has a degree of agency to shape the future if it chooses to use it; HR professionals need to develop the skills to ensure that ethics and fairness are at the centre of AI development for HR and people management.",

At the same time, it will provide them with the necessary tools and skills to face current global problems (poverty, health quality, income disparities, environmental crises, among others) from a transdisciplinary perspective. Progress in the digitalization of higher education has been significantly accelerated by the onset of a pandemics in early 2020 (in European conditions). Such a rapid and massive transition to distance (online) education with comprehensive support for digital technologies is unparalleled. The survey conducted reflects the consequences of this change. Results shows that digital transformation improves some of the most demanded skills in the new knowledge society (searching and processing information, digital communication and socialization or working with text). Likewise, it has an important role in reducing costs related to education, but also in degradation of abilities in personal communication.",

      "abstract": "Soil and water bioengineering is a technology that encourages scientists and practitioners to combine their knowledge and skills in the management of ecosystems with a common goal to maximize benefits to both man and the natural environment. It involves techniques that use plants as living building materials, for: (i) natural hazard control (e.g., soil erosion, torrential floods and landslides) and (ii) ecological restoration or nature-based re-introduction of species on degraded lands, river embankments, and disturbed environments. For a bioengineering project to be successful, engineers are required to highlight all the potential benefits and ecosystem services by documenting the technical, ecological, economic and social values. The novel approaches used by bioengineers raise questions for researchers and necessitate innovation from practitioners to design bioengineering concepts and techniques. Our objective in this paper, therefore, is to highlight the practice and research needs in soil and water bioengineering for reconciling natural hazard control and ecological restoration. Firstly, we review the definition and development of bioengineering technology, while stressing issues concerning the design, implementation, and monitoring of bioengineering actions. Secondly, we highlight the need to reconcile natural hazard control and ecological restoration by posing novel practice and research questions.",

After reviewing key tenets of recent debates, I advance a specific understanding of the concept \u2013 critical digital literacy \u2013 that, as I argue, comprehensively addresses issues of knowledge, competencies, and skills in relation to digital technologies. In particular, I posit that critical thinking about educational and other values of \u2018the digital\u2019 needs to take structural aspects of the technology into account that are often eschewed in instrumental or commercially-driven approaches. To prepare pupils for their future lives requires a widest possible contextualisation of technology, including issues of exploitation, commodification, and degradation in digital capitalism. Finally, I make concrete suggestions for constructive uses of technology in teaching and learning.",

      "abstract": "This study briefly summarizes the development experiences of special economic zones in China and Africa, the lessons that Africa can learn from China, and the preliminary results of the Chinese investments in special economic zones in Africa. The study makes recommendations on how to unleash the power of special economic zones and industrial zones in Africa through strategically leveraging the Chinese experiences. The success factors of Chinese special economic zones include the strong and long-term commitment of the government, a conducive business environment in the zones, strategic locations, technology upgrading and skills training, and strong linkages with the local economy. However, the Chinese experiences highlight some pitfalls to avoid, such as the ?mushroom approach? and high-level overlaps at the later stage, environmental degradation, and the unbalance between industrial development and social dimensions. This calls for a bigger role for the market. Sub-Sahara Africa's experience with traditional economic zones has been relatively poor, except in a few countries, such as Mauritius. The key challenges include the poor regulatory and institutional framework, lack of effective strategic planning, weak governance and implementation capacity, and inadequate infrastructure, among others. Since 2006, China has implemented special economic zone projects globally, including in four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is still too early to conduct a full assessment of these projects; however, the evidence shows that some zones have begun to attract investments and make important contributions to the local economy. The main challenges include access to land, regulatory barriers, resettlement and coordination issues, and lack of external infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Braverman\u2019s Labor and Monopoly Capital tapped into a late twentieth century sense that work while appearing ever safer, cleaner and more automated, was actually, less skilled, more controlled, and more intensive. For Braverman the general movement in work in the twentieth century had been towards degradation of skill and worker control, devoid of creative technical content and thought. Braverman\u2019s monumental book drew on Marx\u2019s writings on technology and the labour process, for the conditions of American capitalism in the 1970s. He provoked such heated debate that the term \u2018Bravermania\u2019 has entered the sociological lexicon. His analysis on the labour process in late modernity has seen scholars of organization, work and society at loggerheads over an array of issues. While some writers have attacked Braverman for underplaying the potential for worker resistance, others have defended his analysis as more nuanced and ultimately true to its Marxist inheritance. These debates, which continue to this day on both sides of the Atlantic, but as the paper demonstrates, there has been a movement away from some of the grander themes of Labor and Monopoly Capital (the state, the class structure, the universal market) towards a narrow focus on skill. But there has also been a widening of debates, with new themes (embodiment of labour, globalization, heightened mobility of labour, fragmentation of employment contracts, and spatial division of labour) which has moved labour process theory on and continued to rejuvenate discussion around the control and direction of work that Braverman helped to initiate.",

They have safeguarded children, older adults and diverse adults in \u2018at risk\u2019 groups under tough conditions mediated by digital technologies, adhered to government injunctions, maintained social and physical distancing under lockdown and worked from home remotely. Social workers and social care workers have risen to the challenges, providing services with inadequate personal protective equipment and limited supervision and support. This article highlights the degraded physical environments, socio\u2010economic and political contexts that intensify precariousness and constraints that neoliberalism imposed on professional capacity before and during this health pandemic. It provides guidelines to protect practitioners and service users. It concludes that practitioners ought to understand zoonotic diseases, environmental concerns, acquire disaster expertise and training, widen their practice portfolio and value their contributions to this pandemic. Key Practitioner Message: \u2022 Develop technological skills and innovate to support stressed individuals, safeguard children, adolescents and elders and deal with poverty and unemployment; \u2022 Use digital technologies involving peers to explore tricky situations, examine ethical dilemmas through scenario building exercises, and tips for self\u2010care; \u2022 Contribute to environmental protections that prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases like COVID\u201019; \u2022 Seek supervision and support for disaster\u2010based training from your line manager .",

A profile of this segment has been developed along with an analysis of the marketing implications for destinations and tourism providers. Design/methodology/approach The research involved examining academic, institutional and trade literature to provide an overview of the millennials profile and the related developments causing disruptive changes in the tourism sector. Findings The characteristics of the millennials with the greatest potential to disrupt the tourism sector are their strong digital skills, high degree of permanent connectivity, search for outstanding experiences and altruistic behaviours. The results already present from these characteristics \u2013 with a high probability of intensifying in the future \u2013 are the practice of volunteer tourism, search for places not connected with tourism and adoption of new, disruptive technologies. Even though volunteer tourism is an act of altruism, it can have harmful implications for tourist destinations in which it occurs. In addition, tourist invasions of places traditionally occupied only by residents can lead to the removal of locals from these places, manifestations of \u201ctourismphobia\u201d and ultimately degradation of these tourists\u2019 experiences. Finally, the adoption of disruptive technologies by tourism agents to fulfil the millennials\u2019 demands for immediate responses reduces human interactions highly valued by millennials and, therefore, requires close monitoring. Originality/value This study\u2019s value arises from its systematic identification of the millennials characteristics that are most likely to disrupt the tourism sector\u2019s functioning, allowing the relevant stakeholders to adopt proactive strategies, minimise potential negative impacts and maximise opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Research and development of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is booming, partly due to hopes and claims regarding the benefits of PLF for animal welfare. These claims remain largely unproven, however, as only few PLF technologies focusing on animal welfare have been commercialized and adopted in practice. The prevailing enthusiasm and optimism about PLF innovations may be clouding the perception of possible threats that PLF may pose to farm animal welfare. Without claiming to be exhaustive, this paper lists 12 potential threats grouped into four categories: direct harm, indirect harm via the end-user, via changes to housing and management, and via ethical stagnation or degradation. PLF can directly harm the animals because of (1) technical failures, (2) harmful effects of exposure, adaptation or wearing of hardware components, (3) inaccurate predictions and decisions due to poor external validation, and (4) lack of uptake of the most meaningful indicators for animal welfare. PLF may create indirect effects on animal welfare if the farmer or stockperson (5) becomes under- or over-reliant on PLF technology, (6) spends less (quality) time with the animals, and (7) loses animal-oriented husbandry skills. PLF may also compromise the interests of the animals by creating transformations in animal farming so that the housing and management are (8) adapted to optimize PLF performance or (9) become more industrialized. Finally, PLF may affect the moral status of farm animals in society by leading to (10) increased speciesism, (11) further animal instrumentalization, and (12) increased animal consumption and harm. For the direct threats, possibilities for prevention and remedies are suggested. As the direction and magnitude of the more indirect threats are harder to predict or prevent, they are more difficult to address. In order to maximize the potential of PLF for improving animal welfare, the potential threats as well as the opportunities should be acknowledged, monitored and addressed.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental component of initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+); will be the development of robust and cost-effective measuring, reporting, and verification (MRV) instruments for national forest monitoring and safeguard information systems. It is increasingly recognized that community-based monitoring (CBM) offers a positive model for greater participation and engagement of indigenous and forest-dependent communities within a REDD+ framework. Yet plans for CBM within REDD+ MRV systems remain limited, and there are currently relatively few concrete examples of CBM informing national forest monitoring systems. This paper outlines findings from a community MRV project with Amerindian communities in the North Rupununi, Guyana; and demonstrates that a CBM approach can enable key REDD+ requirements: in understanding local deforestation drivers and measuring carbon stocks; and for providing information on safeguards through social and environmental assessments. In addition, the authors discuss community capacity-building on smartphone technology for monitoring as a challenging yet viable pathway for scaling the use and adoption of indigenous knowledge and local skills for REDD+ programs.",

      "abstract": "Land and forest management practices in developing countries have resulted in millions of hectares of degraded lands. This is caused by policy implementation unable to synergize between conservation-ecological goals, and the economic needs of farmer households. This study aims to showcase a model for bringing together economic and ecological interests more closely in line with one another. Furthermore, the study also presents an institutional structure of a program that could help to establish agroforestry-based land rehabilitation policies. The research employed includes a combination of Farming Income Analysis and Interpretative Structural Modeling Analysis. The results show that farming income, when employing agroforestry technology is higher than non-agroforestry approaches. Furthermore, agroforestry technology supports critical land rehabilitation and provides conditions for longer term sustainability. Therefore, a programmatic institutional approach is needed to support these dual goals. We identify that a programmatic approach would include: (1) applying conditions of an agroforestry system as a holistic structured unit, (2) improvement of farmer knowledge and skills, (3) increasing the role and capacity of relevant institutions, (4) improving coordination between sectors, (5) developing conservation agriculture systems, (6) improving bureaucratic support systems, and (7) strengthening control and supervision functions. These elements imply that implementation of agroforestry technology requires institutional support in designing policy for critical land rehabilitation, of which would have significant economic and ecological outcomes on critical lands.",

This article traces the transformation of practices of skill in the context of technological change in the artisanal fisheries of Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu, to explore a set of linked questions about skills and work: How expansively or narrowly should skills be understood? What can we learn from traditional modes of skills transmission? As technology makes redundant many of the traditional skills, are we seeing a \u2018degradation\u2019 of work? A focus on fishing, a traditionally caste-bound occupation, also opens up questions regarding the work that skills do within a political economy, both in reproducing a given social order, and in enabling change. In tracing processes of labour recruitment in the mechanized fisheries, the article offers a further reflection, about the extent to which skills matter in securing employment, given the continued importance of networks of caste, kinship and village-based community.",

      "abstract": "Purpose With ever-increasing global concerns over environmental degradation and resource scarcity, the need for sustainable manufacturing (SM) practices has become paramount. Industry 5.0 (I5.0), the latest paradigm in the industrial revolution, emphasizes the integration of advanced technologies with human capabilities to achieve sustainable and socially responsible production systems. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of I5.0 in enabling SM. Furthermore, the review discusses the integration of sustainable practices into the core of I5.0. Design/methodology/approach The systematic literature review (SLR) method is adopted to: explore the understanding of I5.0 and SM; understand the role of I5.0 in addressing sustainability challenges, including resource optimization, waste reduction, energy efficiency and ethical considerations and propose a framework for effective implementation of the I5.0 concept in manufacturing enterprises. Findings The concept of I5.0 represents a progressive step forward from previous industrial revolutions, emphasizing the integration of advanced technologies with a focus on sustainability. I5.0 offers opportunities to optimize resource usage and minimize environmental impact. Through the integration of automation, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics (BDA), manufacturers can enhance process efficiency, reduce waste and implement proactive sustainability measures. By embracing I5.0 and incorporating SM practices, industries can move towards a more resource-efficient, environmentally friendly and socially responsible manufacturing paradigm. Research limitations/implications The findings presented in this article have several implications including the changing role of the workforce, skills requirements and the need for ethical considerations for SM, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary collaborations, policy support and stakeholder engagement to realize its full potential. Originality/value This article aims to stand on an unbiased assessment to ascertain the landscape occupied by the role of I5.0 in driving sustainability in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the proposed framework will serve as a basis for the effective implementation of I5.0 for SM.",

It was initiated in Nepal to mitigate increasing deforestation and forest degradation and address the negative impacts on rural livelihoods. Different studies are conducted by researchers to assess the role of community forest in biodiversity conservation in Nepal. Researchers focused on analysis of biomass, carbon stock analysis, calculation of biodiversity index, change in land use and land cover, spatial analysis of forest resources, camera trapping of wild fauna and socioeconomic analysis by using different primary and secondary data collection techniques. It can be concluded that community forestry management had a great role in biodiversity conservation in Nepal. Biomass, carbon stock, growing stock, soil organic carbon, forest cover, forest products and benefit from forest resource had increased due to community forestry management. Wild animals such as leopard, porcupine, monkey and other birds were increased in the forest. It is recommended to provide skill development trainings and financial support for the installation of renewable and alternative energy technologies to minimize the use of forest resources. More researches on assessing role of community forestry management in biodiversity conservation should be conducted.",

Prior work in a lower middle-income country demonstrated degradation of CPAP skills and knowledge after the initial training. <b>Aims</b>: To determine if a training-of-trainers (ToT) curriculum can decrease gaps in skills and knowledge between first-generation (trained by a United States physician and nurse) and second-generation healthcare providers (trained by local trainers) in Kenya, and to describe the usage pattern, outcome and safety in patients who received CPAP following the trainings. <b>Methods</b>: The first day of training entailed didactic and simulation sessions. On the second day participants were taught how to train others to use CPAP. First- and second-generation healthcare providers were tested on their skills and knowledge. Unpaired <i>t</i>-tests were used to test for equivalence. Prospective data on CPAP usage was collected following the initial trainings. <b>Results</b>: 37 first-generation healthcare providers (16 nurses; 21 physicians, medical/clinical officers) were trained as trainers and 40 second-generation healthcare providers (19 nurses, 21 physicians, medical/clinical officers) trained by first-generation healthcare providers were available for skills and knowledge testing. There were no statistically significant differences between first- and second-generation healthcare providers' skills (90%, 95% CI 87-93 <i>vs</i> 89%, 95% CI 86-92) or knowledge scores (91%, 95% CI 88-93 <i>vs</i> 90%, 95% CI 88-93). A total of 1111 patients were placed on CPAP mostly by nurses (61%), prematurity/acute respiratory distress syndrome was the most common indication, nasal injury/bleeding (2%) was the most common reported adverse event, and the overall mortality rate was 24%. <b>Conclusion</b>: The ToT model was successful, nurses initiated CPAP most commonly, prematurity with acute respiratory distress syndrome was the most common indication, and adverse events were uncommon.",

      "abstract": "Human performance optimization (HPO) is defined as \"the process of applying knowledge, skills and emerging technologies to improve and preserve the capabilities of military members, and organizations to execute essential tasks.\" The lack of consensus for operationally relevant and standardized metrics that meet joint military requirements has been identified as the single most important gap for research and application of HPO. In 2013, the Consortium for Health and Military Performance hosted a meeting to develop a toolkit of standardized HPO metrics for use in military and civilian research, and potentially for field applications by commanders, units, and organizations. Performance was considered from a holistic perspective as being influenced by various behaviors and barriers. To accomplish the goal of developing a standardized toolkit, key metrics were identified and evaluated across a spectrum of domains that contribute to HPO: physical performance, nutritional status, psychological status, cognitive performance, environmental challenges, sleep, and pain. These domains were chosen based on relevant data with regard to performance enhancers and degraders. The specific objectives at this meeting were to (a) identify and evaluate current metrics for assessing human performance within selected domains; (b) prioritize metrics within each domain to establish a human performance assessment toolkit; and (c) identify scientific gaps and the needed research to more effectively assess human performance across domains. This article provides of a summary of 150 total HPO metrics across multiple domains that can be used as a starting point-the beginning of an HPO toolkit: physical fitness (29 metrics), nutrition (24 metrics), psychological status (36 metrics), cognitive performance (35 metrics), environment (12 metrics), sleep (9 metrics), and pain (5 metrics). These metrics can be particularly valuable as the military emphasizes a renewed interest in Human Dimension efforts, and leverages science, resources, programs, and policies to optimize the performance capacities of all Service members.",

      "abstract": "The unceasingly augmenting emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) has contributed substantially to the degradation of the key environmental parameters and the deterioration of performance of the agricultural sector globally. The food insecurity problem has been aggravated consequently. Due to a variety of economic and social issues, many farmers in developing economies use low-efficient and environmentally unfriendly agricultural practices. Adopting innovative technologies and practices linked with sustainable farming remains a complex issue across the developing world. In particular, financial exclusion and low financial literacy are commonly cited as the critical obstacles to achieving sustainable development. To contribute to resolving this development problem, the study attempts to investigate the effects of financial inclusion and literacy on establishing a sustainable performance of farms. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from 220 farmers within the Central Punjab region of Pakistan. Small-scale farms demonstrated a potential to sustain their performance by improving financial inclusion and financial literacy. Trust in extension services for agriculture plays a significant role in moderating the impact of eight independent variables (knowledge, skills, attitude, behavior, access, usage, quantity, welfare) on sustainable farm performance. The study implies that increased trust in financial services is essential for improving sustainable performance in the agricultural sector. The effect imposed by financial actors is crucial for establishing trust in financial services linked to sustainability within the agricultural industry.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.",

      "abstract": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is implementing new capabilities that rely on the support of automation to improve air traffic eficiency and predictability while maintaining safety. One issue that needs to be addressed regarding such new forms of automation - primarily as decision support tools - support is the possible impact on human performance such as knowledge and skill degradation. In particular, the question is whether after long-term use air traffic controllers will be able to effectively revert back to previously used manual operations if the automation becomes unavailable due to some degradation or failure. Based on this concern, this paper focuses on lessons learned from past experiences with the long term use of automation. To explore this issue, 21 experts were interviewed from four different domains: naval operations, medicine, nuclear power plant operation, and aviation. Three distinct job positions were interviewed within the domain of aviation: Airline dispatchers, pilots, and air traffic controllers. Two fundamental questions were addressed: 1.Can the introduction of automation have unintended negative impacts on human performance? 2.What mitigation strategies can be used to avoid or reduce these potential negative impacts on human performance and on system performance? Based on these data, five potential negative impacts of automation that were identified: \u00b7Degradation of Knowledge and Skill; \u00b7 Reliance on Automation as the Primary \"Agent\" to Detect Problems; \u00b7 Reduced Attentiveness and Preparation to Deal with Automation Degradations or Failures; \u00b7 Alarm Fatigue, False Alarms, and Ignoring Alarms; \u00b7 Automation-Induced Effects on Team Situational Awareness and Teamwork. In addition, six strategies to mitigate these potential negative impacts were documented: \u00b7 Providing Effective Training and Experience; \u00b7 Supporting Effective Teamwork; \u00b7 Learning from Past Performance with Data Analytics; \u00b7 Developing and Using Contingency Procedures and Checklists; \u00b7 Designing Technology to Support Effective Human-Automation Teaming.",
