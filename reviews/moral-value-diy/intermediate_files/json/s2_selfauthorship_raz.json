      "abstract": "Certain forms of practical deference seem to be incompatible with personal autonomy. I argue that such deference undermines autonomy not by compromising the governance of an authentic self, nor by constituting a failure to track objective reasons, but by constituting a particular social relation: one of interpersonal rule. I analyze this social relation and distinguish it from others, including ordinary relations of love and care. Finally, I argue that the particular form of interpersonal rule constituted by dispositions of practical deference in itself entails a partial, though not total, disconnection from the good of a self-authored life.",

      "abstract": "This article develops a liberal theory of the virtues in business. I first articulate two key liberal values embodied within market society: self-authorship and mutual benefit. Self-authorship is a mode of autonomy given expression through the effective exercise of economic liberties. Mutual benefit involves the intentional pursuit of the well-being of one\u2019s transaction partners within economic exchange. These values are uniquely realized, I argue, within business, conceptualized as a distinct, firm-level, social practice. More specifically, individuals realize self-authorship by purposively integrating cospecialized resources, forms of knowledge, and business functions to facilitate mutually beneficial transactions. Through their commitment to mutual benefit, businesspersons establish ongoing, cooperative relationships with customers, members of other firms, and various stakeholders more generally. These relationships are constitutive of a distinct liberal notion of the common good. The practice of business and the common good in a market society are sustained by a range of individual-level virtues. I recount these virtues and, before concluding, discuss several other theoretical implications of this account.",

      "abstract": "Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) can autonomously pursue long-term goals, make decisions, and execute complex, multi-turn workflows. Unlike traditional generative AI, which responds reactively to prompts, agentic AI proactively orchestrates processes, such as autonomously managing complex tasks or making real-time decisions. This transition from advisory roles to proactive execution challenges established legal, economic, and creative frameworks. In this paper, we explore challenges in three interrelated domains: creativity and intellectual property, legal and ethical considerations, and competitive effects. Central to our analysis is the tension between novelty and usefulness in AI-generated creative outputs, as well as the intellectual property and authorship challenges arising from AI autonomy. We highlight gaps in responsibility attribution and liability that create a\"moral crumple zone\"--a condition where accountability is diffused across multiple actors, leaving end-users and developers in precarious legal and ethical positions. We examine the competitive dynamics of two-sided algorithmic markets, where both sellers and buyers deploy AI agents, potentially mitigating or amplifying tacit collusion risks. We explore the potential for emergent self-regulation within networks of agentic AI--the development of an\"algorithmic society\"--raising critical questions: To what extent would these norms align with societal values? What unintended consequences might arise? How can transparency and accountability be ensured? Addressing these challenges will necessitate interdisciplinary collaboration to redefine legal accountability, align AI-driven choices with stakeholder values, and maintain ethical safeguards. We advocate for frameworks that balance autonomy with accountability, ensuring all parties can harness agentic AI's potential while preserving trust, fairness,&societal welfare.",

Tomasi prompts this question with his attempt to reconcile Rawls\u2019s theory of justice as fairness with free-market capitalism, by claiming that economic activity is a way for people to exercise their autonomy, responsibility, and self-authorship, including through voluntary risk-taking. Critics argue that the social environment generated through market institutions is ill-suited for developing a sense of responsibility and autonomy among citizens. We refine the case for economic liberty by looking at the link between risk-taking and attitudes toward democratic citizenship.

One traditional answer holds that participating in democratic self-government amounts to a kind of autonomy: it enables citizens to be the authors of their political affairs. Many contemporary philosophers, however, are skeptical. We are autonomous, they argue, when important features of our lives are up to us , but in a democracy we merely have a say in a process of collective choice. In this paper, we defend the possibility of democratic autonomy, by advancing a conception of it which is impervious to this objection. At the core of our account is the idea of joint authorship. You are a joint author of something when that thing expresses your joint intentions. Democracy may not make any one of us sole author of our political affairs, but it can make us their joint authors. It is in such joint authorship, we claim, that the intrinsic value of democratic self-government consists.",

      "abstract": "In chapter 7 of A Liberal Theory of Property, Professor Dagan offers an account of justice in the design of markets that draws on his broader account of the core legal institutions that underpin the notion of a market: property and contract. Since both institutions are facilitative of the demands of autonomy as self-determination or \u2018self-authorship\u2019, we can evaluate the justice or injustice of any market norm on the basis of whether it facilitates autonomy in this sense. In this comment on the chapter, I focus on one dimension of Dagan\u2019s account of autonomy as self-authorship\u2014the view that it entails both the freedom to commit to a particular story of one\u2019s life and the freedom to \u2018discard one story and begin another\u2019\u2014and explore its connection to the core market freedom to sell, or refuse to sell, what one owns. I begin by considering why the freedom to exit past commitments is important to property law on Dagan\u2019s account, outlining his critique of the alternative picture of exclusion as the chief concern of property and commitment as the chief concern of contract law. Next, I consider why, on Dagan\u2019s account, sale\u2014as distinct from gift or abandonment\u2014must be a vital \u2018exit option\u2019 from a property governance regime in a liberal property system and how this understanding of sale inflects the precepts of relational justice that apply in the context of the marketplace. Finally, I draw on this account to show that Dagan\u2019s theory provides an attractively nuanced framework for analysing particular doctrines of English law that constrain freedom of sale and for thinking, more broadly, about institutions like mortgages, trusts, and bankruptcy regimes.",

      "abstract": "Hanoch Dagan\u2019s most recent book on property theory represents a further development of his liberal theory of property by articulating a previously \u2018missing fundamental premise\u2019; the previously acknowledged features of \u2018a genuinely liberal conception of property\u2019 are now seen to be \u2018founded on the ultimate value of personal self-determination.\u2019 Moreover, the very legitimacy of property \u2018is to be premised on a fundamental commitment to autonomy as self-determination or self-authorship\u2019 (xii). The introduction of a commitment in Dagan\u2019s prefatory comments is particularly revealing. For him property is not simply a vindication of the individual holder\u2019s rights, or autonomy. It encompasses a commitment by both the holder and others in society to the self-determination of both the holder and others in society. The force of this central premise is immediately felt in two directions. On a non-liberal conception of property lacking this premise, there is the recognition that property can amount to unrestricted private authority (xii), following Blackstone\u2019s characterisation of \u2018despotic dominion\u2019, so as to make others subject to the owner\u2019s will in a way which effaces their capacity for self-determination (9\u201310). In Dagan\u2019s eyes this is enough to question the legitimacy of property. In the other direction, it has a radical impact on Dagan\u2019s liberal conception of property. He sees the commitment to self-determination as exercising a restraint from within property on the holder\u2019s own authority: \u2018carefully delineated and circumscribed by its service to owners\u2019 autonomy\u2019 (xii). The commitment also carries with it acceptance of the requirement of relational justice towards others, in acknowledging \u2018reciprocal respect for self-determination\u2019 (xii). The third key feature of Dagan\u2019s conception of property springing from this commitment is the provision of a \u2018multiplicity of property types ... needed for adequate self-determination\u2019 (xii). In his own words, these form the \u2018three pillars\u2019 of his liberal conception of property: carefully delineated private authority of the property holder; relational justice towards others; and, structural pluralism to provide a wide choice of property types (xiii).",

It totally separates law from morality. Morality is not a subject matter of law because morality is guided by emotions and self created values. British school has accepted various dimensions of positivism i.e. imperative theory, analytical theory, normative theory and legal system theory. Austin and Bentham are the supporter of imperative theory, HLA Hart is the devotee of analytical theory, Kelson is the proponent of normative theory and Joseph Raz is the follower of legal system theory. Although, Kelson and Joseph Raz are not from British origin, they contributed in line of British School of Thought. Kelson is from Vienna and Joseph Raz is from Jerusalem. Raz contributed for British School of Thought by teaching and writing. The divorce tradition of law and morality began with David Hume in philosophy. He burrowed it from Sextus Empiricus, a Greek philosopher. This tradition was applied in law by Bentham. He classified jurisprudence as censorial and expositorial jurisprudence but censorial jurisprudence is not a part of legal philosophy. However, Austin is the father of British Positive School because his publication appeared in the market prior than Bentham\u2019s writing. HLA Hart analyses law with the union of primary and secondary rules and Kelson presents law as the hierarchy of norms with the domination of basic norms. Finally, Joseph Raz presents legal system as normative, institutional and coercive characters with the analysis of problem of existence, identity, structures and content.",

      "abstract": "Autonomy in the etymological sense means authorship in the form of dealing with the law and can be translated as the capacity to self-govern. The development of the human autonomy has been the point of an old debate of diverse knowledge fields such as philosophy, education and psychology. Is the development of autonomy the goal of all human training? That is the question that we follow in order to contribute to this debate. The purpose of this reflection was to locate, in a systemic way, several contributions of the human thought in the formation for autonomy, not in a purely gnosiological perspective but also considering the broader ontological and social determinations. In the condition of a theoretical essay, we explored the interface between several fields of knowledge, especially psychology and education. That is what we called here autonomous subjects located in the world. To illustrate the situation, we describe, in an exploratory way, the relationship between the teacher formation in Brazil and an education for autonomy.",

The authors seek to demonstrate how dialogue, phenomenological self-regulation, and the principles of Gestalt therapy shape a \u00abnew face\u00bb of the subject-one capable of maintaining autonomy and responsibility in contemporary post-industrial dynamics.\nThe methodological foundation of the study is grounded in philosophical discourse (Kant, Heidegger, Beck, Bauman, Castells) combined with qualitative analysis of psychotherapeutic practices. Key concepts of the Gestalt approach are examined-such as \u00aborganismic self-regulation\u00bb, \u00abmindful presence\u00bb, and dialogical contact-drawing on case material from individual and group sessions, as well as empirical data on their effectiveness.\nResearch results show that the skill of slowing down and observing one\u2019s own bodily and emotional responses increases the internal locus of control, reduces anxiety, and enhances the ability to engage in constructive dialogue. Participants in Gestalt groups exhibit lower susceptibility to manipulative media stimuli and a stronger sense of authorship over their own decisions. It is emphasized that dialogical self-regulation does not contradict rationality but complements it with phenomenological sensitivity and an ethical orientation toward the \u00abI\u00a0\u2014 You\u00bb relationship.\nThe prospects of the study promise for the integration of Gestalt principles into educational, corporate, and social programs, contributing to the development of a culture of responsibility and supporting subjective maturity in the face of accelerating global changes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article explores the intricate relationship between humanism, digital technology, and human rights, emphasizing the importance of ethical, social, and cultural considerations alongside technical expertise in navigating the digital age. Rooted in Renaissance ideals of human dignity and self-determination, it argues that access to digital tools constitutes a fundamental right of citizenship, essential for meaningful participation in a globally connected society. Initiatives like Uruguay\u2019s Ceibal program exemplify efforts to democratize technology, revealing both successes and persistent challenges in ensuring digital inclusion and equitable access. The role of the digital humanist is highlighted as a crucial intermediary, merging technological insight with ethical reflection to safeguard human autonomy and dignity in the face of rapid innovation. The article underscores the importance of advocating for a rethinking of cultural paradigms to prioritize human dignity and self-determination in technological integration rather than relying on technology to safeguard humanity from itself (see the \u201chuman in the loop\u201d). This approach calls for a reflective and responsible framework that aligns technological advancement with the principles of equity, inclusion, and human flourishing. The potential of digital storytelling and electronic literature, including examples like We Are Fragmented, Voz P\u00fablica, and Priya\u2019s Shakti, is explored as a means to amplify marginalized voices and foster empathy, demonstrating how technology can be harnessed for the advancement of human rights. These narratives illustrate how digital tools can contribute to cultural and ethical enrichment rather than alienation, challenging society to rethink foundational concepts like authorship, responsibility, and authenticity.",
