Some accept the intuitive demarcations of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words \"just ain't in the head\", and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We propose to pursue a third position. We will advocate an externalism about mind, but one that is in no way grounded in the debatable role of external reference in fixing the contents of our mental states. Rather, we advocate an *active externalism*, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.",

            "In this way, linguists such as Clark (1996) are correct that language is like a dance in which coordination between partners plays a major role. What they leave out is the interaction between the dancers and the dance hall, the other dancers at the party and human microbiota who call us home while we sweat and salsa. In order to accommodate the analysis of big data, the complex inter-organism interactions and their environments, statistical and network approaches have become prominent. Thus, biological systems are usually represented as dynamic networks which form complex sets of binary interactions or relations between different entities and their contexts. Graph theory has been a very useful tool in the representation of biological networks. The vertices represent different biological entities such as proteins and genes in biological networks, and edges convey information about the links or interactions between the nodes. The links can be weighted or assigned quantitative values to encode various properties of interest, either topological or otherwise. More complex networks of networks can model the interaction between systems themselves (Gao et  al. 2014).33 It is this aspect of systems biology that I think makes it especially applicable to biolinguistics as per the \u2018truism\u2019 that \u201ccomplex systems are often modelled as networks or information processing systems\u201d (Ladyman and Weisner 2020: 9). These networks can take the form of trees or forests. See Fig. 3 below for different kinds of networks used on plant systems biology. Some networks model correlations across multiple conditions (a), while others (b) model sets of molecular interactions (or \u2018interactomes\u2019), (c) shows hierarchical regulatory networks of genes with another way of modelling this shown in (d) by means of graphs that resemble finite-state automata. The idea in complexity science and systems biology is that these (graph-theoretic) tools are not merely instruments but tell us something ontologically important about organic life and reality respectively. Silberstein (2022: 600), for instance, claims that \u201creality is more like multiscale complex networks or structured graphs of extrinsic dispositions\u201d. He insists that this view is commonplace in network neuroscience. Deacon (2008) argues that life itself is a third-order emergent property characterised by self-organisation and processes which involve some form of history or memory.",

            ", using a notebook in lieu of bio-memory to navigate to a museum (Clark and Chalmers, 1998). The original thought was that since external resources sometimes meet certain conditions of \u201cglue\u201d (the resources were available when needed) and \u201ctrust\u201d (they were subject to constant scrutiny) they can be included as part of a cognitive process or system. EAI is thought to provide a way of cashing out this idea. On the one hand, the process of uploading is said to show how agents can learn to engage with epistemic cues already laden within their niche, trading off neurocognitive functions to environmental resources for increased behavioural success (the trust condition). On the other hand, it is claimed that because agents upload computational work to their cognitive niche, they can become \u2018glued\u2019 to the environment over developmental and evolutionary time scales. To reap the increased behavioural rewards, agents must continuously rely on the hidden states of the environmental generative process (the glue condition). As Constant et al. frame the point: \u201cthe long-term built environment and the cultural milieu further scaffold this [generative] process, nesting our individually extended minds inside larger co-constructed niches that likewise extract, flag, and cue optimal (i.e., expected free energy minimal) action\u201d (2020, p. 18). The takeaway is that EAI is thought to provide a general vindication of the key ideas behind extended cognition, e.g., functional isomorphism, the parity principle, epistemic action, and diachronic cognition. As Constant et al. (2020) see the promise of the approach: [T]he hope is to provide future researchers with a formal apparatus to make progress in these debates by showing how the varieties of claims on extended cognition may be formally expressed in EAI, a lingua franca of sort.",
            "\u20263\nple, in its classic formulation, the notion of \u2018functional isomorphism\u2019 stresses how internal and external states often play similar or equivalent epistemic or functional roles in cognitive processes, e.g., using a notebook in lieu of bio-memory to navigate to a museum (Clark and Chalmers, 1998).",

If, as Ingold (2000) argues, technical enskilment is a process of explorative material engagement whereby affordances arise, then skilled tool use is the cultivated causal cognitive ability to be solicited by the appropriate affordances of a given task as they arise."
