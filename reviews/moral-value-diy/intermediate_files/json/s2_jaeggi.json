      "abstract": "Rahel Jaeggi\u2019s theory of alienation has received less attention than her work on forms of life and capitalism. This theory avoids the problems of traditional theories of alienation: objectivism, paternalism, and essentialism. It also sidesteps post-structuralist criticisms of the theory of alienation. However, Jaeggi\u2019s theory is flawed in two ways: it is not historically specific, and so cannot explain why alienation is a problem for modernity rather than other historical periods, and it is difficult to connect to social critique. I argue that Karl Marx\u2019s later theory of alienation, as interpreted by Moishe Postone and others, is able to avoid the problems that Jaeggi\u2019s theory avoids, and is also able to avoid the flaws in her theory. This suggests that critical theory should focus on a theory of capitalism rather than normative social theory.",

      "abstract": "Fortunately, the challenge of alienation is now again taken seriously in intellectual discussions. Already years ago, Axel Honneth made the reflection on alienation a defining issue for social philosophy per se, and as the prime example of social philosophy, he brought forth Critical Theory. Within this horizon, recently two conceptions of alienation have been proposed by Rahel Jeaggi and Hartmut Rosa, and the present article takes issue with both of these proposals, criticizing in particular their anti-essentialism. Hence, questioning the post-metaphysical agenda that Jaeggi has inherited from Honneth, I criticize her juxtaposition of the existentialist and the Marxist critique of alienation, her understanding of the good life as autonomy, and finally her acceptance of post-modern and liberal criticism of metaphysics and ontology. Turning to Rosa, I appreciate his societal approach to the critique of alienation, emphasizing the significance of capitalist modernity, but also he accepts the postmetaphysical agenda, and his aesthetic idea of the good life as resonance remains strongly individualistic. Both of these conceptions of alienation thus have ideological implications that threatens to turn upside down the original intentions and implications of Critical Theory in relation to social and political justice. To conclude, the criticism of capitalism, political economy and real life politics is still relevant for understanding alienation, and therefore it is worth returning to the classics of the discussion.",

      "abstract": "The essay discusses the relations between structural injustice and objective alienation (also called supra-individual alienation): that is, a type of social alienation where human-established norms and practices are perceived as unchangeable external forces, necessary and prescribing adaptation. These rigidified and \u201cnaturalized\u201d norms and practices often conceal and reinforce relations of structural injustice, and, in turn, are sustained by them. I aim at inquiring, also by applying an intersectional perspective, the theoretical and practical relations between the two: I highlight their mutual differences, explore their interconnections, and outline potential normative strategies for addressing them comprehensively. I do this with the help of fictional, but realistic examples taken from literary and philosophical works, such as Richard Wright\u2019s novel Native Son, Theodor Fontane\u2019s Effi Briest, Doris Lessing\u2019s short story \u201cTo Room Nineteen\u201d, as well as examples provided by Iris Marion Young and Rahel Jaeggi.",

Detachment, isolation and alienation are examples of how the development affects human\u2019s sociological and psychological state. This study attempts to propose the idea of alienation as a significant issue and is still relevant in society nowadays by presenting examples found in the novel How to Stop Time (2017) by Matt Haig. The examples found are reflected upon theories and condition in the contemporary society. As for the framework of alienation, this study employs the three aspects of alienation proposed by Jaeggi (2014) namely the intertwined powerlessness and meaninglessness, the construct of social heteronomy, and the relation of relationlessness, to unravel how it is depicted in the novel through the relation and interrelation among the main character\u2019s experiences, his associates, other characters, and the time itself. The result of the study suggests that the novel depicts all the aspects of alienation proposed by Jaeggi (2014). The quasi-immortal trait of the main character and his associates, also show other issues which dominantly are the issue of loneliness and the loss of freedom through their experience of alienation. The findings in the study suggest that the theory is productive and proposes a practical contrasting stand point of alienation which is the relation of appropriation. Further research on the novel How to Stop Time (2017) is suggested due to its rich potential of explorability.",
