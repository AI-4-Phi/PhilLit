Our proposal centres on the principles of autonomy and vulnerability, whose joint adoption we deem able to constitute an original revision of a bottom-up approach in care ethics.",

Nel Noddings, in her &#x27;Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education&#x27;, further contributed to this important discussion.
