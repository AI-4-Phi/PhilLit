====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The authenticity literature divides into historical and contemporary strands. Historically, the concept emerged from Romantic expressivism and existentialist philosophy (Rousseau, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre), emphasizing self-discovery, genuine self-expression, and living in accord with one's deepest commitments. Contemporary analytic philosophy has reconstructed authenticity as a defensible ethical ideal while addressing critiques of narcissism and self-indulgence. Key debates center on: (1) essentialist vs. existentialist conceptions of the true self; (2) the relationship between authenticity and autonomy (are they distinct ideals or overlapping?); (3) whether authenticity requires self-transcendence through engagement with external values or can be purely self-referential; (4) the role of authenticity in grounding moral agency and self-authorship.

Recent work (Guignon 2004, Taylor 1991, Bauer 2021) reconstructs authenticity as requiring both inward self-reflection and outward engagement with shared horizons of value. This positions authenticity as a social virtue requiring commitment to sustaining democratic communities. Critics (Rodríguez Apólito 2022) argue procedural autonomy accounts should avoid authenticity requirements due to their potential to obscure oppression. The process/outcome distinction emerges in debates over moral testimony (Mogensen 2015), where authenticity grounds the value of forming moral beliefs oneself rather than deferring to others.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Authenticity theories directly address the value of doing things yourself versus having them done for you. If authenticity is valuable, then actions expressive of one's genuine commitments have special moral significance independent of their outcomes. This grounds a DIY ethic: self-authorship and genuine agency matter morally because they constitute authentic living. The existentialist emphasis on self-making through choice suggests the process of doing something oneself (rather than delegating) is constitutive of authentic selfhood. Contemporary accounts emphasizing self-transcendence also suggest limits: authenticity may require engaging with values beyond mere preference, constraining what counts as genuinely authentic action.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited contemporary work explicitly connecting authenticity to delegation, reliance on tools/technology, or the specific value of manual/personal effort. Most literature focuses on belief formation, identity, and social roles rather than practical activities. The distinction between doing something "oneself" and merely being causally responsible for an outcome is under-theorized in the authenticity literature.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the distinction between essentialist (discovery-based) and existentialist (self-making) authenticity, as these ground different views on DIY value. Highlight the tension between authenticity as inward-looking (genuine self-expression) versus requiring outward engagement (social horizons, shared values). Connect to moral testimony debates where process/outcome distinctions are explicit.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Authenticity is a defensible moral ideal when properly understood as requiring self-transcendence through engagement with horizons of significance beyond the self. Against critics who see authenticity as mere self-indulgence, Taylor argues the original Romantic ideal contains an essential element of connection to values and meanings that transcend individual preference. Authentic self-realization requires dialogical engagement with others and critical appropriation of shared cultural frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses whether doing things yourself has moral value. Taylor's account suggests authenticity requires not just self-expression but engagement with genuinely valuable projects. This constrains DIY ethics: not every self-directed activity is authentically valuable, only those connected to inter-subjective horizons of meaning. The emphasis on self-transcendence suggests limits to pure self-authorship.

  POSITION: Contemporary reconstruction defending authenticity as social virtue requiring external horizons of value.

  abstract = {It has long been customary for America's freestanding colleges to support philosophical gurus, whose presence helped to make those institutions what they were: seedbeds (that is, "seminaries") of critical thinking, where young over-achievers would be invited to scrutinize the import of their "career plans." One wonders whether the goal-driven aspirations of today's academe will allow such figures to be replaced as they become emeriti, but we can hope "in sh'Allah!" The two figures compared and contrasted in this valedictory study -- Charles Taylor and Bernard Lonergan -- have functioned that way for many on a far wider screen. But how can one be a philosophical guru on the world scene? Brian Braman's analysis of each thinker helps to respond to that question, in the measure that one can. Focusing on "authenticity" allows him to elucidate the point of the engagement in inquiry which they share, and suggest how each of them might help us to find and execute thepointof our own intellectual inquiry. In that sense, each of these prospective mentors exhibits thetelosproper to classical philosophy: searching for what is true and good, and doing so in such a way as to appropriate what we discover; that is, make it our own. For the promise of philosophical inquiry has ever been to carry us beyond the preoccupations of our mundane selves, which Braman takes to be the sense of "authenticity" which they share: "a way of living one's life in a new dimension" (98-99). I take that final characterization of his study to be both more modest and more accurate than his definition opening the concluding chapter: "authenticity for Taylor and Lonergan is the experience of a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing" (98). For if Lonergan can freely use the term 'experience', that is only (I would surmise) because he seems quite innocent of that loaded "subjective" sense which Taylor is astute enough to avoid. So replacing 'is the experience of', from Braman's valedictory statement, with the more modest 'reflects' will offer a less contested summary of the subject of his inquiry: "authenticity for Taylor and Lonergan reflects a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing."
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Now "transfigurations" normally defy descriptive language, precisely because what takes place there invites us well beyond the ordinary reach of our discourse, invariably moving us to evocative and analogous speech, so leading into what Kierkegaard dubbed "edifying discourse." And if that goal never escaped classical philosophical inquiry, it has come to describe, in our time, the role of gurus. That alteration in the very conception and practice of "philosophy" deserves more than comment, and Taylor himself has devoted more than 900 pages to exploring the manifold factors helping to bring it about in his recentA Secular Age; yet for now let it simply explain why those of us fortunate enough to encounter such inspiring teachers often found them more engaging in person than in print. In fact, many of them wrote little, though some, like these, have been prolific. Yet even here the teacher/student encounter will differ qualitatively from that of readers encountering their written works, as Plato insisted in hisSeventh Letter. In fact, I have often found it difficult to introduce friends and colleagues to two of my most inspiring teachers -- Bernard Lonergan for one, and Wilfrid Sellars for another -- with only their writings to offer. And my brief but intense interaction with Charles Taylor (in Oxford in 2005) suggests something similar. Not that his writings or those of Bernard Lonergan cannot effect a stimulating entrée into their respective worlds and intentions, but that personal encounter will do it far better. And that precisely because their respective "worlds" are ever calling them and their students beyond themselves. For their distinctive modes of inquiry are designed to respect and to implement thetelosproper to philosophical inquiry, which seeks to realize Socrates' ideal of consistency between thought and action; that is, to move beyond mere logical consistency to personal appropriation. Again, that is what prospective students often anticipate in "philosophy," and if they find themselves disappointed rather than fulfilled, we (philosophers) have no one to blame but ourselves! For we have regularly been taught to settle for (indeed to make an icon of) "logical consistency," while relegating Socrates' further call to another realm; perhaps to "theology."

Yet recalling that quite modern bifurcation -- philosophy/theology -- exhibits another merit of Braman's study, for by rightly eschewing the labels yet directing us to the mentors inspiring each -- Heidegger for Taylor and Aquinas for Lonergan -- he gestures towards their respective horizons: philosophical for Taylor and theological for Lonergan. Yet again, he is wise not to offer those distracting labels but moves immediately to the way each elucidates a path to "a profound transfiguration in one's being and doing." While Taylor employs a hermeneutic strategy redolent of Heidegger, he nevertheless focuses his "moral ontology [on]phronesis-- practical reasoning," in the spirit of "Aristotle'saletheuein-- living in the truth" (37). So then it becomes natural to raise "demands for ethical judgments," or those constitutive goods which Taylor dubs "hypergoods": "that is, goods that are not only incomparably more important than the others but provide the standpoint from which these must be weighed and decided about" (30). In other words, the dialectical progression built into our inherently analogous use of 'good' demands that we find one which will order the others. Taylor buttresses this characteristically Augustinian move with the notion ofepiphany: "the manifestation which brings us into the presence of something which is otherwise inaccessible, and which is of the highest moral or spiritual significance" (43). Astute readers will note how recourse to "knowing by presence" is latent in the cognate notions ofmanifestationorpresence, so as neatly to bypass modern preoccupations with "representation" or analytic demands for "conceptualization." Yet the very term 'epiphany' reminds us that this step is already latent in the activity of interpretation which shapes philosophical inquiry for Taylor. Although epiphanies will arise freely, they are neither totally unexpected nor unrecognizable when they do arise. These "hypergoods" must be the goal inherent in our entire activity of inquiry.

Here lies the interior point of connection between Taylor and Lonergan, between two Canadians of different generations yet like-minded in their faith; one a quintessential university person, and the other a Jesuit whose formation in the "spiritual exercises" of Ignatius of Loyola became more evident as his life of inquiry unfolded, from Canada to England, then to Rome, and finally to Boston College in the United States. While those who have inquired into Lonergan's patterns of thought tend to find the inspiration for his dynamic epistemology in the Belgian Jesuit, Maréchal, his own reflections turn to John Henry Newman as his professed mentor. It is Newman of theGrammar of Assent, for whom understanding is a thoroughly personal engagement with realities which mind alone can discern. Following Newman at this crucial juncture, "Lonergan understands knowledge as performative -- knowledge of the subject as subject in act (engaged)" (81), as the mind itself "is a dynamic longing within the person for wholeness and completion" (56). Indeed, both Lonergan and Taylor are clear about “coming to know [as] a common enterprise" (82). Lonergan locates this quest in "the dynamic unity of consciousness as experiencing, understanding, and judging that constitutes human knowing in its fullest and truest sense" (61). "Under the sway of reason," the desire to know is distinguished from all other desires in that it "does not seek to possess, master, or control its object" (60). So we are not surprised to learn that the detachment inherent in such a desire (de Chardin) tends ineluctably towards a threefold "conversion: intellectual, moral and religious" (59). Lonergan will then identify "intellectual conversion [as] the affirmation of our self as knower" (62), moral conversion as the exigency for performative consistency (Socrates), and religious conversion as coming to "be in love with the divine ground [which] reveals to us to whom we are ultimately responsible and to whom we ultimately respond in self-transcending love" (68). This is, of course, full-blown theological language, which Lonergan is freer to use than Taylor, insisting that "sustained authenticity is impossible without growth in a loving relationship fully brought to fruition by being in love with the source of all meaning and value" (94).

So Braman concludes by reminding us how both "Taylor and Lonergan agree with Augustine in holding the priority of love [over] knowledge" (99). Although such an affirmation was always latent in the inner dynamic of Lonergan's "unrestricted desire to know," affirming it remained for him a later development, much as Taylor's explicit faith pronouncements would wait for the more autobiographical remarks found in James Heft's edition:A Catholic Modernity(Oxford, 1999). Gurus can become gurus only when they are addressing a palpable need, yet will continue to be so only as they lead those with such needs to a critical appropriation of their own desire to know and to love. So if the language must be theological in the end, the modality will be thoroughly philosophical, so Braman's way of finessing that difference between these two is again to be commended.},

  doi = {10.4324/9780203646793},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Authenticity is both a personal virtue and a fundamentally social commitment. Guignon traces the concept's historical development from Rousseau through existentialism to contemporary culture, arguing that coherent authenticity requires reflective discernment of what is genuinely worth pursuing in one's social context. Authentic individuals must commit to sustaining the type of free society in which authenticity is possible, making it an irreducibly political virtue in democratic contexts.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for understanding authenticity as requiring both self-direction and social responsibility. For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things yourself has value not just as self-expression but as participation in sustaining democratic life. The capacity for clear self-awareness and public expression of one's stance is precisely what democratic societies require, linking personal authenticity to civic virtue.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes essentialist authenticity (true self as discovered inborn traits) from existentialist authenticity (true self as values-driven self-invention). Argues authenticity emerges not only via matching actions to some true self but also through "poiesis"—humane self-making processes. Mature authenticity emphasizes interdependent self-actualizing rather than mere independence, correcting common oversimplifications of self-actualization theory.

  RELEVANCE: The essentialist/existentialist distinction is crucial for DIY ethics. Essentialist authenticity doesn't necessarily ground doing things yourself (one could discover one's "true nature" through passivity). Existentialist authenticity, emphasizing self-making through values-driven action, more directly supports the moral value of DIY: one authors oneself through the process of doing, not just the outcome. The emphasis on poiesis (self-making processes) over mere matching suggests process has independent value.

  abstract = {The transformative self aims toward authenticity and self-actualizing, which this chapter addresses from a developmental perspective. Two forms of authenticity are distinguished. Essentialist authenticity defines the true self as solely a matter of self-discovery and being true to one’s inborn traits or perceived soul. Existentialist authenticity also values self-discovery but emphasizes self-invention and being true to one’s values. Essentialist authenticity does not necessitate moral concerns, but existentialist authenticity does. The chapter argues that authenticity emerges not only via the matching principle of authenticity (matching actions with some true self) but also via the poiesis principle (the humane, self-making processes and perspectivity of a quiet ego). Youthful authenticity emphasizes independence and identity consolidation, whereas mature authenticity emphasizes interdependent self-actualizing. The chapter then examines self-actualization as maturely authentic self-understanding. Finally, the chapter reframes Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to correct common oversimplifications of belongingness and esteem in light of the developing, transformative self.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that resistance to moral testimony (deferring to others' moral judgments) stems from attachment to an ideal of authenticity rather than from the value of moral understanding or aretaic considerations. When we believe it's important to form moral beliefs ourselves rather than accept them on testimony, we're implicitly valuing authenticity—the idea that one's moral beliefs must originate in oneself to have proper authority or meaning.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the DIY question in epistemic/moral contexts: why does it matter whether we form beliefs ourselves versus accepting them from reliable sources? Mogensen's analysis reveals that authenticity ideals ground the intuition that the process (forming beliefs oneself) matters beyond outcomes (having true beliefs). This provides a model for extending DIY intuitions beyond belief formation to practical activities: perhaps we value doing things ourselves because we implicitly value authenticity in action, not just belief.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques procedural autonomy theories (especially Christman's) for their reliance on authenticity requirements, which fail to detect forms of heteronomy arising from social oppression. Argues that oppression often produces preferences that feel authentic to agents (coherent, reflectively endorsed) but actually reflect internalized oppression. Procedural accounts should avoid authenticity injunctions and instead require self-problematization from a social perspective.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the link between authenticity and genuine agency/self-authorship. For DIY ethics, this suggests caution: doing things "oneself" may not track genuine agency if one's sense of what to do oneself reflects oppressive social conditioning. The paper highlights that authenticity (matching one's actions to felt preferences) can come apart from autonomy (genuine self-direction). This complicates the project of grounding DIY value in authenticity.

  abstract = {An ongoing debate between ‘procedural’ and ‘substantive’ theorists of personal autonomy addresses the following question: should agents have the final say on their own autonomy or should the objective circumstances in which agents live take prevalence when assessing their autonomy? Proceduralists favour the first strategy and substantive theorists restrict more explicitly the conditions under which autonomy is possible. I focus on forms of heteronomy which derive from oppressive circumstances and accept that substantive theorists are correct in contending that (i) forms of oppression common in contemporary liberal societies (e.g. gender or racial oppression) tend to increase heteronomy; and (ii) the heteronomy which derives from social oppression tends to fly below the radar of procedural accounts. Still, I argue that a revised procedural strategy could limit these forms of heteronomy as long as it avoids the injunctions to ‘authenticity’ common in procedural models. I proceed by reconstructing John Christman’s model which, I argue, constitutes the most promising procedural account to assess autonomy under oppression. Christman’s theory, however, needs to be reinforced to ensure self-problematisation in light of a social perspective. I show that the latter is necessary to experience the forms of alienation which are markers of heteronomy according to Christman.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys the concept of authenticity from its Romantic origins through existentialism to contemporary philosophy. Argues that authenticity, properly understood, is not opposed to social life but requires it—being true to oneself involves clarity about one's commitments and willingness to express them publicly. In democratic contexts, authenticity becomes a character ideal supporting effective citizenship: the capacity to know one's own mind and advocate for it is precisely what democracy requires.

  RELEVANCE: Provides concise overview of authenticity debates and their connection to democratic life. For DIY ethics, the emphasis on authenticity as public self-expression (not just private self-feeling) suggests that doing things yourself matters partly as a mode of engaging with social life. The value isn't purely internal (self-satisfaction) but connects to being an effective participant in shared projects and institutions.

The first section critiques authenticity as a simple reference to cultural purity, a traditional isomorphism or historical verisimilitude or as an ‘ethnographic authenticity’. Demarcation of authenticity must take into account philosophical literature that argues that authenticity is an existential question of the ‘modern’ era. Thus, authenticity is offered to us as individuals as a remedy for the maladies of modernity: alienation, anomie and alterity. Authenticity is then discussed as a question of value within an economy of cultural politics that often draws on simulacra, creating cultural relics of dubious origin. The final section discusses various methodological failures and problematiques that are highlighted by the concern for, and scrutiny of, authenticity. The first is the simulacral failure. The subjects of anthropology are mostly real flesh-and-blood people-on-the-ground with real needs. In contrast is the simulacral subject, the brand, the tourist image, the media image or the ever-familiar hyper-real bushmen. Lastly, the article considers what Spivak calls ‘withholding’ – a resistance to authentic representation by the Other. Resistance suggests a need for a radically altered engagement with the Other that includes both a deepening, and an awareness, of anthropology as a process of common ontological unfolding},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops account of authenticity within Dialogical Self Theory (DST), rejecting the humanist notion of a static "true self" in favor of viewing authenticity as involving how one is in one's actions and relationships. Authenticity emerges through (1) personal positions shaping social positions, (2) I-positions differing in openness and personal endorsement, (3) I-positions encompassing shared/collective identity, and (4) emotional tenor of experiences. Authenticity is dynamic, multifaceted, and situation-sensitive rather than monolithic.

  RELEVANCE: Offers contemporary psychological account avoiding essentialist authenticity while preserving its normative force. For DIY ethics, this suggests authenticity in action need not track a single "true self" but involves alignment between personal positions and enacted roles. Doing things yourself may matter because it allows fuller expression of personally endorsed positions rather than merely occupying prescribed social roles. The emphasis on how one is in actions (not just outcomes) supports process-based value.

  abstract = {Abstract In dialogical self theory (DST) authenticity has not been a central concern. The humanist notion of a static, higher-order, superordinate, ultimate, and “true” self runs counter to the ontology of DST, and the conceptualization of the dialogical self as unconsolidated, multifaceted, dynamic, and sensitive to situational change. In a climate in which the psychology of authenticity is undergoing revision—and in which the existence of a “true” “inner” self is increasingly questioned—it is these qualities that make DST highly suited to the investigation of authenticity in contemporary life. Four aspects of DST can facilitate the exploration of authenticity: (1) the function of personal positions and their role in shaping and stylizing social positions, (2) how I-positions differ in relation to openness to innovation and the degree to which they are personally endorsed, (3) how I-positions can encompass a shared identity and can express a collective voice, and (4) the emotional tenor of experiences involving authenticity. To illustrate the utility of this conceptual assemblage, a case study of the authenticity experiences of an early-career language teacher is presented. The study demonstrates how, in the dialogical self, authenticity involves the experience of how one is in one’s actions and in one’s relationships.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Identifies cases where affective states undermine autonomy despite being coherent with the person's other attitudes and having inoffensive origins—"tyrannical coherence." Argues existing procedural autonomy accounts fail to capture how such affective states can "hijack" decision-making.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges coherence-based accounts of authenticity and autonomy. For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things in accord with felt preferences isn't sufficient for genuine self-authorship if those preferences reflect tyrannical affective states. The paper implies that authentic agency requires not just alignment between action and self, but a kind of meta-capacity to resist being ruled by any particular aspect of oneself.

 There are cases of psychiatric disorder where affective states produce severely self‐destructive behavior. Sufferers do not appear to be making autonomous decisions, and appear to be severely impaired in their decision‐making capacity. Suffers of these kinds of cases of these kinds of disorders fall into a “gray area” in the law. If this gray area is to be avoided, the law requires clearer criteria for determining how affect can undermine autonomy. Existing “procedural” accounts of autonomy that explicitly set out to deal with how affective states can undermine decision‐making are unable to deal with a clinically significant class of such cases. In this class of cases, autonomy is undermined by an affective state that is relevantly coherent with the rest of the person's affective states and attitudes, and has relevantly inoffensive origins. The relevant affective state nevertheless appears to “hijack” the person, and to rule over them “tyrannically.” I argue for a necessary condition on autonomy amenable to a procedural account,
 non‐tyranny
 , according to which one is autonomous with respect to a decision only if one has the ability to resist the influence of any given affective state on that decision.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends existentialist interpretation of authenticity (drawing on Heidegger and Sartre) as superior to essentialist frameworks for evaluating human genetic engineering. Existentialist authenticity involves dynamic, relational process rooted in choice, responsibility, and engagement with existential conditions rather than conformity to species-typical genome. Genetic engineering can expand authenticity by enabling greater autonomy and self-expression when applied responsibly.

  RELEVANCE: Applies existentialist authenticity framework to new technology, illustrating how authenticity grounds evaluations of self-modification practices. For DIY ethics, the analysis suggests existentialist authenticity favors self-directed transformation over passive acceptance of given conditions. If authenticity requires active self-making through choice, then doing things yourself (including modifying yourself) may have special value. However, the paper also shows authenticity can conflict with "natural" self-conception, complicating simple DIY ideals.

  abstract = {Human genetic engineering has the potential to profoundly alter the traits of future generations, raising critical ethical questions about authenticity and identity. Essentialist perspectives reject genetic engineering, claiming it inherently compromises authenticity by deviating from a species-typical genome. In contrast, this article advocates for an existentialist interpretation of authenticity, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger and Sartre. Here, authenticity is understood as a dynamic and relational process rooted in individual choice, responsibility, and engagement with existential conditions. Unlike essentialism, existentialism evaluates genetic interventions not as inherently wrong but based on their alignment with values such as autonomy and authenticity, offering a more flexible and ethically robust framework. Existentialism's emphasis on individual freedom, self-determination, and the creation of meaning in life makes it ethically more compelling than essentialist frameworks, which impose deterministic constraints. Moreover, essentialist critiques falter when they concede the permissibility of therapeutic genetic engineering, undermining the notion of an inherently valuable species-typical human genome. In contrast, existentialism affirms the transformative potential of genetic engineering, recognising it as a means to expand autonomy, self-expression, and opportunities for flourishing when applied responsibly. The article advocates for a balanced ethical approach by integrating the Principle of Procreative Beneficence, which promotes enhancements to optimise flourishing, with the Principle of Procreative Non-Maleficence, which safeguards autonomy by preventing deterministic constraints. This complementary framework, grounded in an existentialist perspective, reframes authenticity as an evolving concept aligned with the transformative possibilities of genetic engineering, enriching the discourse on bioethics and identity in a rapidly changing era.},

Against both expressivist authenticity (mere self-expression) and rationalist universalism, Ferrara argues authenticity involves "self-congruency" of identity and can ground normative validity through its exemplary character. This provides a pluralism-friendly universalism suited to contemporary diverse societies.

  RELEVANCE: Offers sophisticated reconstruction of authenticity as normative ideal that avoids both subjectivism and rigid universalism. For DIY ethics, Ferrara's account suggests doing things yourself matters when it expresses self-congruent identity in exemplary ways—not just any self-directed action, but those that achieve genuine integration of identity. The emphasis on self-congruency (not mere self-expression) raises questions about when delegation threatens authenticity and when it's compatible with it.

  POSITION: Contemporary reconstruction grounding normativity in exemplary authenticity rather than generalizability.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends authenticity as ethical ideal while critiquing its co-optation by contemporary capitalism (through self-help literature and management practices). Argues authenticity emerges through "alternativeless choices"—existential decisions where we discover and constitute ourselves simultaneously. These commitments have internal structure that commits us beyond our immediate preferences to publicly intelligible values, constraining our practical deliberation.

  RELEVANCE: Analyzes the phenomenology of authentic choice and its connection to values beyond preference. For DIY ethics, Varga's account of "alternativeless choices" suggests that doing things yourself matters most when it involves self-constitution through commitment, not just executing pre-existing preferences. The emphasis on being committed to publicly intelligible values implies that authentic DIY action must connect to shared frameworks of meaning, not pure self-invention.

Nevertheless, there are also good reasons to defend an ethical ideal of authenticity, not least because of its critical and oppositional force, which is directed against experiences of self-abandonment and self-alienation. I will argue for an elaborated ethical ideal of authenticity: the ambitious ideal of a continuous self-reflective process of 'self-authentication'. For this purpose, the ideal of being authentic in expressing and unfolding one's individual personality and characteristics will be combined with the ideal of being 'an authentic person' - whereby 'a person' is to be understood in a Kantian sense as an autonomous person who is (at least potentially) reasonable and morally responsible},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues Pattern Theory of Self (PTS) provides best framework for understanding DBS impacts on selfhood but requires extension to include moral aspects: authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility. These aspects serve both as evaluative lenses and as products of self-pattern dynamics. How we define authenticity determines our concept of autonomy, which determines how we think about responsibility—revealing complex interdependencies.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates how authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility interrelate in contexts where technology modifies the self. For DIY ethics, this suggests that doing things yourself may matter because it preserves authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility simultaneously. When technologies (like DBS) or delegation disrupt the normal connections between these aspects, questions arise about whether the person is genuinely "doing" the action or whether the action expresses their authentic self.

Regarding (1), I argue that the pattern theory of self (PTS) can be regarded as such a framework. In realizing (2) and (3), I indicate that most relevant issues concerning PTS that require resolutions are ontological issues, including the persistence question, the “specificity problem”, and finding lacking relevant aspects of the self. In realizing (4), I identify aspects of the self not included in PTS which are desperately needed to investigate the full range of potentially relevant DBS-induced changes—authenticity, autonomy, and responsibility, and conclude that how we define authenticity will have implications for our concept of autonomy, which in turn will determine how we think about responsibility. Concerning (5), I discuss a complex relation between moral aspects and PTS—on one hand, they serve as the lens through which a particular self-pattern can be evaluated; on the other, they are, themselves, products of dynamical interactions of various self-aspects. Finally, I discuss (6), demonstrating novel way of understanding the effects of DBS on patients’ selves.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between authenticity and autonomy in multicultural contexts, analyzing how cultural membership and individual self-determination interact. Argues that authenticity claims can both support and undermine autonomy depending on whether they're used to constrain individual choice or enable meaningful self-expression within cultural frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Explores tensions between authenticity (being true to cultural identity) and autonomy (self-directed choice) in contexts where the two can conflict. For DIY ethics, this highlights that doing things "oneself" might mean different things: following culturally authentic practices versus autonomously choosing one's path. The paper suggests these ideals can diverge, complicating simple accounts of self-authorship.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Cicero's modification of the Stoic persona metaphor, arguing one must be not the actor but the author (auctor) of one's persona. Being an auctor in the profound sense means not primarily constructing social roles but accepting and affirming both rational human nature and existential contingencies. This rejects Stoic indifference and suggests a new relation between self and social roles.

  RELEVANCE: Historical analysis of self-authorship concept predating modern authenticity discourse. For DIY ethics, Cicero's distinction between acting and authoring one's persona suggests that genuine self-authorship involves acceptance and affirmation rather than pure construction. This complicates the idea that "doing it yourself" means creating from scratch—perhaps it means taking responsibility for what's given as well as what's chosen.

Understanding Cicero’s concept of auctoritas allows us to reread his famous doctrine of the four personae in De Officiis as a rejection of Stoic indifference and as suggestion of a new relation between the self and its personae. For Cicero, to be an auctor in the most profound sense is not to produce but rather to foster and give testimony. Thus, to be author of one’s own persona is not in the first place to construct and adopt a social role, but to accept and affirm both one’s rational human nature and the contingencies of existence in the world.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues Kierkegaard's teleological suspension of the ethical presupposes a theocentric anthropology where humanity's telos finds fulfillment in relationship with God. The aesthetic life fails by grounding identity in externality, the ethical life fails by detaching duty from person—both deny authenticity. Only the religious stage, initiated by teleological suspension and relating directly to God, achieves authenticity within a theocentric framework.

  RELEVANCE: Presents Kierkegaardian view that authenticity requires transcendent grounding beyond both external conformity and ethical universalism. For DIY ethics, this suggests limits to pure self-authorship: if authenticity requires relationship with what transcends the self, then doing things "oneself" might paradoxically require submission to transcendent authority. This contrasts sharply with existentialist self-making models.

 This paper presents a specific interpretation of the teleological suspension of the ethical. It argues that the suspension presupposes a theocentric anthropology in which humanity’s telos finds fulfilment in relationship with God. In performing the suspension, the individual fulfils their telos. The argument develops by situating the suspension within Kierkegaard’s broader authorship.

 existential trajectory, where one moves from the aesthetic to the ethical and finally to the religious stage. Each transition occurs through a negation of the self and resulting despair. The aesthetic life fails because it grounds identity in externality, thereby undermining authenticity. The ethical life fails because it detaches duty from the person, once again denying authenticity. Initiated by the teleological suspension, the religious stage occurs when the self relates directly to God, achieving authenticity. To achieve authenticity, however, the religious stage must presuppose a theocentric anthropology in which one’s telos finds fulfilment in relation to God. It does so because only within such an anthropology does an individual gain authenticity and avoid the despair of the earlier stages by performing the suspension.

Weaving together close readings of three 20th century thinkers: Martin Heidegger, Karl Jaspers and Jean-Paul Sartre with the concept of authenticity, Stephen Eric Bronner illuminates the phenomenological foundations for self-awareness that underpin our sense of identity and solidarity. He claims that different expressions of the existential tradition compete with one another in determining how authenticity might be experienced, but all of them ultimately rest on self-referential judgments. The author’s own new framework for a political ethic at once serves as a corrective and an alternative.
Wonderfully rich, insightful, and nuanced, Stephen Eric Bronner has produced another bookshelf staple that speaks to crucial issues in politics, philosophy, psychology, and sociology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces the historical shift from sincerity (being true to others about oneself) to authenticity (being true to oneself) as the dominant ideal of Western culture. Argues this shift reflects deeper changes in conceptions of the self and its relationship to society, from a self defined by social role-performance to a self defined by inner depths and originality.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational historical analysis of how authenticity became a cultural ideal. For DIY ethics, Trilling's account shows that valuing "doing it yourself" is part of a broader cultural shift toward locating value in individual originality and self-expression rather than skillful performance of social roles. This historicizes the DIY intuition, suggesting it may be culturally contingent rather than universal.
