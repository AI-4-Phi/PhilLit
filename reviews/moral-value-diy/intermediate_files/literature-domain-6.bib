====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses feminist and communitarian critiques of atomistic
conceptions of autonomy and self-reliance. Relational autonomy theories,
developed primarily by feminist philosophers since the late 1980s, challenge
the view that autonomy requires independence from social relationships.
Instead, they argue that autonomy is constituted through—not despite—our
social embeddedness. Key debates include: (1) whether relational accounts
are causally or constitutively relational; (2) whether they are procedural
or substantive; (3) whether they risk paternalism by making oppressive social
conditions autonomy-undermining. Communitarian philosophers (Sandel, MacIntyre,
Taylor, Walzer) argue that liberal individualism neglects how communities shape
moral identities. Care ethicists (Held, Noddings) emphasize interdependence
and the moral significance of caring relationships, rejecting self-sufficiency
as an ideal. Recent work (Khader 2020) raises concerns that relational autonomy
may deny agency to oppressed people, while defenders (Humphries 2025, Mackenzie
2019) argue it better captures constraints on autonomy under oppression.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides critical counterbalance to individualistic DIY valorization.
If autonomy is constituted relationally, then self-reliance may not always be
valuable—dependence on others may be constitutive of autonomy rather than
threatening to it. Care ethics challenges the moral priority of independence.
Communitarian critiques suggest that DIY individualism may reflect problematic
atomistic self-conceptions. These views directly challenge whether "doing it
yourself" is morally superior to receiving help or relying on others.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited direct engagement between relational autonomy literature and craft/DIY
practices. Most applications focus on bioethics, healthcare, and oppression.
Few papers explicitly address the moral value of self-reliance vs. mutual aid
in everyday contexts. The debate sometimes remains abstract; concrete examples
of when interdependence enhances autonomy (beyond healthcare) would strengthen
the literature. Seven entries lack abstracts (marked INCOMPLETE): foundational
edited collection Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000, Mackenzie 2019 overview, early
Nedelsky 1989 article, McLeod & Sherwin 2000 chapter, Stoljar 2017, Holroyd
2009, and Levy 2023. These remain in bibliography for reference but notes
provide sufficient context.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the tension between relational and atomistic autonomy conceptions.
Distinguish causally relational (relationships support autonomy development)
from constitutively relational (relationships partly define autonomy). Note
internal debate: does relational autonomy risk paternalism (Khader) or better
diagnose constraints (Humphries)? Connect to DIY question: does self-reliance
reflect atomistic ideal? Can accepting help manifest autonomy?

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Relational autonomy (Mackenzie/Stoljar, Westlund, Friedman): 11 papers - Autonomy requires/is shaped by supportive social relationships
- Care ethics (Held, Noddings): 2 papers - Interdependence and care are morally fundamental, not threats to autonomy
- Communitarian critique (Sandel): 2 papers - Liberal individualism neglects constitutive communities
- Feminist critics of relational autonomy (Khader): 1 paper - Socially constitutive accounts risk paternalism toward oppressed agents
- Interdependence theorists: 2 papers - Autonomy and interdependence are compatible or mutually reinforcing

  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This foundational edited collection introduces relational autonomy as a feminist reconceptualization of autonomy that rejects atomistic conceptions of the self. Contributors argue that autonomy is compatible with—and may even require—social relationships and embeddedness. The introduction distinguishes causally relational accounts (relationships support autonomy development) from constitutively relational accounts (social conditions partly define autonomy), and procedural from substantive approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding feminist critiques of self-reliance as an individualistic ideal. If autonomy requires supportive relationships rather than independence, then DIY self-sufficiency may not be the autonomy-enhancing ideal it appears. The volume establishes that dependence and autonomy need not conflict, directly challenging valorization of doing things oneself.

  POSITION: Defines the relational autonomy position as rejecting both the atomistic self and self-sufficiency as autonomy prerequisites. Core feminist text challenging individualistic autonomy conceptions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Relational autonomy represents a distinctively feminist philosophical innovation with implications for social justice. Mackenzie argues that relational autonomy theories illuminate how oppressive social contexts undermine autonomy and show why individualistic conceptions fail to capture constraints faced by marginalized groups. The account emphasizes three dimensions of autonomy: self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization.

  RELEVANCE: Recent restatement of relational autonomy's significance by a key founder of the approach. Emphasizes how oppressive social conditions—not just internal psychological states—constrain autonomy. This suggests that individualistic DIY ethics may fail to recognize structural constraints and that accepting support from communities can be autonomy-enabling rather than autonomy-undermining.

  POSITION: Defends relational autonomy as illuminating social justice issues. Argues autonomy requires attending to social conditions, not just individual capacities.

  doi = {10.1163/17455243-20203085},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Khader argues that socially constitutive conceptions of relational autonomy make idealized social conditions necessary for autonomy, which creates problems under nonideal conditions. Such accounts cannot serve key feminist roles: they ask oppressed agents to engage in self-harm to maintain autonomy, and they make oppressed agents appropriate objects of paternalism. Khader contends these accounts fail as both character ideals and paternalism-limiting concepts.

  RELEVANCE: Major internal critique of relational autonomy from a feminist perspective. If Khader is right, then emphasizing social conditions for autonomy could patronize those in oppressive situations who rely on themselves. This might vindicate DIY self-reliance under oppressive conditions—doing things yourself may preserve autonomy when social support is unreliable or controlling. Critical for avoiding over-romanticizing interdependence.

  POSITION: Feminist critique of socially constitutive relational autonomy as problematically paternalistic toward oppressed people.

I argue that such conceptions cannot, when applied under nonideal conditions, play two key feminist theoretical roles for autonomy: the roles of anti-oppressive character ideal and paternalism-limiting concept. Instead, they prescribe action that reinforces oppression. Treated as character ideals, socially constitutive conceptions of autonomy ask agents living under nonideal ones to engage in self-harm or self-subordination. Moreover, conceptions of autonomy that make idealized social conditions a requirement of autonomy yield the conclusion that oppressed agents are appropriate objects of paternalism.},

  doi = {10.1515/mopp-2023-0053},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Humphries defends constitutively relational accounts against charges of paternalism and perfectionism. He argues such accounts are only "thinly" perfectionist in an unobjectionable way, that they oppose rather than enable paternalism, and that their implication that many people lack autonomy reflects problems with the world rather than problems with the theory. We genuinely do lack autonomy in oppressive social conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Recent defense of relational autonomy against Khader's critique. Argues that recognizing social constraints on autonomy is not paternalistic but realistic. For DIY ethics, this suggests that celebrating self-reliance may ignore genuine constraints—people in supportive communities may have more autonomy than isolated self-reliant individuals. Challenges the equation of independence with autonomy.

I argue that although constitutively relational accounts are indeed perfectionist, they are so in such a "thin" way that we should not be concerned by it; that they are not paternalist (and indeed are necessarily hostile to the sorts of power relations necessary for paternalism); and that the charge that relational accounts demand an unattractively high bar for autonomy is misdirected – we really do lack autonomy in perhaps surprising but plausible ways and for the account to imply this is a problem for the world rather than the theory.},

  journal = {Yale Journal of Law and Feminism},
  year = {1989},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {7--36},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Nedelsky argues that traditional liberal autonomy is grounded in a conception of property and boundaries that emphasizes separation from others. She proposes reconceiving autonomy not as self-sufficiency but as self-determination within relationships. Autonomy requires not isolation but particular kinds of relationships that enable rather than constrain self-determination. The focus should shift from boundaries to relationships.

  RELEVANCE: Early and influential feminist critique of autonomy-as-independence. Nedelsky directly challenges self-sufficiency as an ideal, arguing autonomy requires supportive relationships. This undermines moral valorization of DIY self-reliance—if autonomy is enabled by relationships, accepting help may manifest rather than undermine autonomy. Property-based boundaries (mine vs yours) may obscure the relational basis of self-determination.

  POSITION: Foundational feminist argument that autonomy is relational, not achieved through separation. Challenges liberal property-based self-sufficiency ideal.

  address = {Oxford},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Friedman develops a relational conception of autonomy sensitive to gendered social contexts. She argues that traditional autonomy theory ignores how gender socialization and oppression constrain self-determination. Friedman defends autonomy as still valuable for women but argues it must be reconceived to acknowledge social embeddedness. She distinguishes her procedural relational account from substantive approaches, arguing agents can be autonomous even while endorsing oppressive norms if they reflectively endorse them.

  RELEVANCE: Influential book-length treatment of relational autonomy with attention to gender oppression. Relevant to DIY because it questions whether women's traditional care work reflects autonomy deficits or different forms of self-determination. If care and interdependence are compatible with autonomy, DIY individualism may devalue relational forms of agency. Procedural approach allows that accepting help can be autonomous.

  POSITION: Defends procedural relational autonomy that acknowledges social embeddedness while preserving reflective endorsement requirement.

  abstract = {In her recent book, Amy Allen tackles one of the persistent problems of post-Foucaultian critical theory: how can we acknowledge the pervasive mechanisms of power in the formation of our identities, and yet still allow for an ideal of autonomous action? This problem -- one that has been a sticking point in the discussion between Foucaultians and Habermasians -- has also come to be an issue of much importance in the feminist literature.The Politics of Our Selvesis a persuasive and well-reasoned account of how we might find our way through some difficult -- some might say 'intractable' -- problems of contemporary feminism and critical theory. The book demonstrates that the perceived opposition between power and knowledge is something of a red herring. Recognizing this, moreover, has important consequences for some of feminism's most serious debates -- as well as for understanding the appropriate parameters of a critical theory.

The Politics of Our Selvesbegins by rethinking the Foucault/Habermas debate -- a debate that centers on the place of critique in the network of power. In reading Foucault's work, where power 'is everywhere' and is that in virtue of which agents are constructed and placed within systems of normalization and subordination, a persistent worry seems to arise: if power is absolutely everywhere, how is it possible to engage in the critique of power in such a way that we might (at least partially) liberate ourselves from the oppressive aspects of power? If power pervades everything, it follows that it pervades rationality, and hence that the use of rationality itself is riddled with the very means of subordination we are trying to overcome. It is precisely this criticism that has been leveled against the Foucaultian enterprise by philosophers like Habermas and Charles Taylor.

It is in this debate that Allen makes her first significant contribution to our thinking through the relation of power and knowledge with an eye to the possibility of transformative critique. In Chapters 2 and 3, Allen aims to show that Foucault's analysis of power has been (largely) misunderstood as the repudiation of critique, when in fact Foucault's work is acall to critique:

What Foucault is calling for is a critique of critique, which means not only a criticism of Kant's project for the way in which it closes off the very opening for thought that it had created but also a critiquein the Kantian sense of the term --that is, an interrogation of the limits and conditions of possibility of that which Kant himself took as his own starting point, namely, the transcendental subject. (35)

Foucault's aim is thus, in essence, an attempt to up the ante of critical theory: instead of assuming the capacity of a pure rationality, embedded in a power-free subject, to determine what is and should be, Foucault wants to critically analyze the very notion of subjectivity in the historical conditions which produce it. This by no means entails that critique is no longer possible. Rather, it entails that critique, if it is to be worthy of the name, must be sensitive to the historical forces at work on our own capacities to be selves and our ability to achieve autonomy. Once we have reconceived Foucault's endeavor in this manner, it becomes much easier to see that "the differences between Habermas's and Foucault's projects have been seriously overstated" (42). Allen's analysis, I think, marks a significant advance in the way we should understand the tension between Foucault and Habermas. The 'stand off' between these philosophers is rightly revealed as a distraction, the importance of which has been overblown on all sides. As is so often the case, what is required to get past a dispute is not dogmatic posturing, butnuance.Allen's reading of Foucault and Habermas brings this in spades, resulting in a much more persuasive understanding of the tension between Foucault and Habermas as based primarily on misunderstanding.

Understanding the Foucault/Habermas debate as resting on a misconception both of Foucault's relation to critique, on the one hand, and Habermas's own notion of the relation of reason and power (which Allen examines in Chapter 5), on the other, allows Allen to make a major step forward in the project ofThe Politics of Our Selves: namely, "to figure out how to understand autonomy such that it is compatible with an understanding of power in all its depth and complexity" (21). This, in turn, makes it possible to consider the relevance of power/knowledge to some particular debates in critical theory in general, and feminism in particular.

One such debate concerns the importance of power in the construction of sex and gender, and how getting beyond sex/gender might be accomplished. If power is pervasive and constitutive of identity, it looks as though abandoning gendered identity might amount to abandoningidentity as such, at least given our currentepisteme(to use a Foucaultian term). Butler (and other feminists) have criticized the view that a recognition of the contingency and plasticity of gender constructions is sufficient to eliminate them. This view ignores the power of such constructions over us. Indeed, it ignores that these constructionsareus. The problem, fundamentally, is that it is onlythroughsuch power-laden constructions that we have an identity. Forced to choose between having an identity that subjugates and having no identity at all, individuals choose to carry on the very sex/gender constructions that have hitherto oppressed them.

Judith Butler's important analysis, however, goes too far. Yet another virtue of Allen's book is to show us why this is the case, and to demonstrate that acknowledging the precarious position of sexed/gendered-identity can actually facilitate a more thoughtful approach to the intersection of power and autonomy. Butler claims thatallidentity is essentially subjugated in virtue of simplybeing bornand hence depending onthe recognition of others. This involves forcing us, in the very process of becoming individuals, to accept extrinsic social requirements in order to be recognized by those whose love we need and desire. As Allen shows, however, this view conflates "dependence and subordination" (84). When we see this, we recognize the possibility of "momentsof mutual recognition … within on-going, dynamically unfolding, social relationships" (91). This, then, allows us to see that we can have our identities, constituted as they are by recognition, in a way that need not involve subjugation, despite the fact that "there is no possible human social world from which power has been completely eliminated" (91). Any conception of the social that does not acknowledge the problems and prospects of such mutual recognition -- recognition that can be transformative -- will ultimately be too narrow.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Westlund argues that autonomy is constitutively relational in a formal (not perfectionist) way. Autonomy requires a dialogical disposition to hold oneself answerable to external critical perspectives. This is a formal interpersonal condition—not requiring any particular relationships or social content. Westlund distinguishes her view from substantive relational accounts that risk perfectionism.

  RELEVANCE: Important development of constitutively relational autonomy that avoids substantive requirements about what relationships must look like. For DIY ethics, this suggests autonomy requires openness to others' perspectives, not self-sufficiency. Even when doing things yourself, autonomous agents must remain answerable to criticism. Pure self-reliance without responsiveness to others may undermine rather than manifest autonomy.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sandel critiques Rawlsian liberalism for presupposing an "unencumbered self" abstracted from constitutive social attachments. He argues we have identities and commitments we discover rather than choose, and that liberal voluntarism cannot account for these. The self is partly constituted by communal attachments that are not chosen but nonetheless define who we are. Sandel defends a communitarian view emphasizing constitutive communities.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational communitarian critique of liberal individualism. Challenges the ideal of the self-made, self-sufficient individual who chooses all commitments. For DIY ethics, Sandel suggests that valorizing self-reliance may reflect a flawed conception of the self. If we are constituted by unchosen attachments to communities, accepting help and mutual aid may be more fundamental than self-sufficiency.

Sandel locates modern liberalism in the tradition of Kant, and focuses on its most influential recent expression in the work of John Rawls. In the most important challenge yet to Rawls' theory of justice, Sandel traces the limits of liberalism to the conception of the person that underlies it, and argues for a deeper understanding of community than liberalism allows.</jats:p},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Held develops care ethics as a distinct moral approach that takes caring relationships as fundamental rather than derivable from justice or rights. She argues care ethics challenges the atomistic individualism of mainstream moral theory, emphasizing interdependence, responsiveness to particular others, and the moral significance of emotions. Care ethics values relationships of mutual support over independence and self-sufficiency.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational care ethics text directly challenging individualism. Held argues interdependence is morally valuable, not merely instrumentally good for development. For DIY ethics, this suggests accepting care and offering care may be morally central—more fundamental than self-reliance.

  abstract = {Abstract The book presents the ethics of care as a promising alternative to more familiar moral theories. The ethics of care is only a few decades old, yet it has become a distinct moral theory or normative approach, relevant to global and political matters as well as to the personal relations that can most clearly exemplify care. The book examines the central ideas, characteristics, and potential importance of the ethics of care. It discusses the feminist roots of this moral approach and why the ethics of care can be a morality with universal appeal. The book explores what is meant by "care" and what a caring person is like. Where such other moral theories as Kantian morality and utilitarianism demand impartiality above all, the ethics of care understands the moral import of ties to families and groups. It evaluates such ties, differing from virtue ethics by focusing on caring relations rather than the virtues of individuals. The book proposes how values such as justice, equality, and individual rights can "fit together" with values such as care, trust, mutual consideration, and solidarity. In considering the potential of the ethics of care for dealing with social issues, the book shows how the ethics of care is more promising than other moral theories for advice on how limited or expansive markets should be, showing how values other than market ones should have priority in such activities as childcare, health care, education, and in cultural activities. Finally, the book connects the ethics of care with the rising interest in civil society, and with limits on what law and rights are thought able to accomplish. It shows the promise of the ethics of care for dealing with global problems and with efforts to foster international civility.},

Building self-trust may require supportive relationships.

For DIY ethics, this suggests that in contexts of oppression or marginalization, self-reliance may be impossible without supportive relationships that build self-trust. Simply telling oppressed people to "do it themselves" ignores structural constraints. Receiving support may be necessary for developing capacity for self-determination.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stoljar defends weakly substantive relational autonomy against the charge that it is objectionably perfectionist. She distinguishes weak substantive accounts (which require self-regarding attitudes like self-trust, not specific values) from strong substantive accounts (which constrain permissible values). Weak substantive accounts avoid perfectionism while recognizing that oppressive socialization can undermine autonomy even when procedural conditions are met.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies relational autonomy's relationship to perfectionism, defending the view that autonomy requires certain self-regarding attitudes but not specific values. For DIY ethics, this suggests that cultivating self-trust and self-worth may matter more than whether one does things oneself or accepts help. The moral question is whether actions express appropriate self-regarding attitudes, not whether they manifest independence.

The key is distinguishing interventions that support autonomy development from those that impose external values.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the paternalism worry about relational autonomy. For DIY ethics, this suggests that sometimes encouraging people to accept help (rather than insisting on self-reliance) may support autonomy development without being paternalistic. But there are limits: forcing dependence would be paternalistic. The challenge is distinguishing support from control.

  POSITION: Examines paternalism implications of constitutive relational autonomy. Argues such accounts can both permit and constrain intervention.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Baumann distinguishes causally relational accounts (relationships causally support autonomy) from constitutively relational accounts (social conditions partly constitute autonomy). He argues that causally relational accounts are less controversial but also less revisionary—they can accommodate most traditional autonomy theory. Constitutive accounts are more radical but face challenges explaining how autonomy can be both social and personal.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the key distinction within relational autonomy literature. For DIY ethics, causally relational accounts suggest relationships support capacity for self-reliance, while constitutive accounts suggest self-reliance may be conceptually confused—autonomy is inherently social. The distinction matters for whether DIY self-sufficiency is even coherently achievable vs. merely causally supported by relationships.

  POSITION: Taxonomizes relational autonomy approaches distinguishing causal from constitutive accounts. Analyzes implications of each.

  abstract = {Abstract The main claim of the paper is that there are irreducibly social agents that intentionally perform social actions. It argues, first, that there are social attitudes ascribable to social agents and not to the individuals involved. Second, that social agents, not only individual agents, are capable of what Weber called "subjectively understandable action." And, third, that although action (if not merely mental) presumes an agent's moving her body in various ways, actions do not consist of such movements, and hence not only individual persons but social groups are genuine agents. We should be pluralists about individuation, rejecting both individualism and collectivism by granting that social agency is neither more nor less ultimate, well-founded, or basic than non-social agency.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Levy argues that the ideal of intellectual autonomy reflects an excessively individualistic conception of good thinking. Because human cognition is deeply dependent on social testimony and collaboration, the ideal should be "intellectual interdependence" rather than autonomy. We ought to rely on others epistemically, not aspire to self-sufficiency in belief formation.

  RELEVANCE: Extends relational/interdependence thinking to epistemology. For DIY ethics, this suggests that epistemic self-reliance (figuring things out yourself) may be misguided—relying on others' expertise may be intellectually virtuous, not deficient. If intellectual interdependence is ideal, practical interdependence (accepting help with tasks) may also be virtuous. Challenges DIY epistemology of figuring things out alone.

  POSITION: Argues intellectual interdependence should replace intellectual autonomy as epistemic ideal. Challenges individualistic epistemology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Willett argues that in an era of global interdependence, autonomy may no longer name our core moral need. She proposes an "ethics of connectivity" emphasizing our ethical obligations arising from interconnection rather than independence. Autonomy tradition in analytic ethics fails to address contemporary realities of global interdependence.

  RELEVANCE: Radical challenge to autonomy tradition suggesting connectivity may replace autonomy as moral foundation. For DIY ethics, this implies moral value may lie in recognizing and honoring connections rather than cultivating self-reliance. In globally interconnected world, pretending to be self-sufficient may be morally problematic denial of our dependence on distant others' labor.

  POSITION: Proposes replacing autonomy tradition with ethics of connectivity. Argues global interdependence makes autonomy less central to ethics.

However, in this article, I challenge this claim. I argue that it grossly overlooks ways in which African philosophy already inherits methods of universal significance, which are applied to African problems and discourse.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Drawing on Butler and Cavarero, Petherbridge rethinks vulnerability as a critical ethical category based on our primary interdependence and intercorporeality. Rather than something to overcome, corporeal vulnerability reveals our fundamental dependence on others. Recognition of shared vulnerability grounds ethical obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Revalues vulnerability and interdependence as ethically significant rather than deficits. For DIY ethics, this suggests that denying our vulnerability and dependence (through insisting on self-reliance) may be ethically problematic. Accepting help may express honest recognition of mutual vulnerability rather than weakness. Challenges invulnerability and self-sufficiency as ideals.

  POSITION: Develops vulnerability and interdependence as positive ethical categories based on intercorporeality. Challenges invulnerability ideal.
