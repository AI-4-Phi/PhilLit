DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The literature on autonomy and self-determination is organized around several
competing theoretical approaches. The hierarchical model, originating with Harry
Frankfurt's seminal 1971 paper, grounds autonomy in the agent's hierarchical
structure of desires and second-order volitions. This approach has been extensively
developed and criticized, with debates over whether it adequately captures authentic
self-governance without infinite regress. The relational autonomy tradition, emerging
from feminist philosophy, challenges individualistic conceptions by emphasizing
that autonomy is socially constituted and develops through interpersonal relationships.
Key proponents like Mackenzie and Stoljar argue that autonomy requires not just
internal coherence but also enabling social conditions. Recent work has explored
autonomy in contexts of deference, delegation, and tool-use, with Michael Garnett's
analysis of practical deference as interpersonal rule being particularly relevant.
The literature also includes reasons-responsive theories and multidimensional
accounts that distinguish self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization
as distinct dimensions of autonomy.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational for understanding whether doing things yourself is
constitutive of autonomous agency or merely instrumental. The hierarchical theories
address whether outsourcing action to others compromises the authenticity of one's
will. Relational autonomy theories challenge the assumption that independence is
necessary for autonomy, potentially supporting delegation as compatible with
self-governance. Garnett's work on deference directly addresses when relying on
others' judgment undermines autonomy, which is central to DIY ethics.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on autonomy in medical contexts (informed consent,
end-of-life care) and political philosophy, there is surprisingly little direct
philosophical analysis of how tool-use, delegation, and outsourcing affect autonomy.
Most discussions of practical deference focus on moral or epistemic deference rather
than practical skill delegation. The relationship between autonomy and achievement
through one's own efforts remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should begin with Frankfurt's hierarchical model as the canonical
individualistic account, then contrast it with relational autonomy to show the
spectrum of views. Garnett's recent work provides a bridge to practical questions
about delegation. The key question for the project is whether autonomous action
requires that the agent be the one who performs the action, or whether autonomous
control over outcomes is sufficient even when means are delegated.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Hierarchical theories (Frankfurt, Bratman): 7 papers - Autonomy as alignment
  between higher-order and lower-order mental states
- Relational autonomy (Mackenzie, Stoljar, Westlund): 6 papers - Autonomy as
  socially constituted through interpersonal relationships
- Reasons-responsive theories (Fischer, Wallace): 2 papers - Autonomy as capacity
  to respond to reasons

  CORE ARGUMENT: Frankfurt argues that what distinguishes persons from other creatures is the capacity for reflective self-evaluation manifest in second-order desires. A person has free will when they have the will they want to have—when their first-order desires align with their second-order volitions. Frankfurt develops a hierarchical model where autonomy consists in identification with one's effective first-order desires through higher-order endorsement, rather than requiring alternative possibilities.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for hierarchical theories of autonomy. It directly addresses whether autonomous action requires that the agent's own desires move them to act, or whether external determination of action undermines autonomy. For DIY ethics, the question is whether having someone else perform an action for you compromises the hierarchical structure Frankfurt identifies as essential to personhood and autonomy—does delegation sever the connection between second-order volitions and effective action?

  POSITION: Hierarchical theory—autonomy as internal coherence and reflective endorsement of one's desires and actions.

  abstract = {What philosophers have lately come to accept as analysis of the concept of a person is not actually analysis of that concept at all. Strawson, whose usage represents the current standard, identifies the concept of a person as “the concept of a type of entity such that both predicates ascribing states of consciousness and predicates ascribing corporeal characteristics...are equally applicable to a single individual of that single type.”1 But there are many entities besides persons that have both mental and physical properties. As it happens—though it seems extraordinary that this should be so—there is no common English word for the type of entity Strawson has in mind, a type that includes not only human beings but animals of various lesser species as well. Still, this hardly justifies the misappropriation of a valuable philosophical term.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Garnett argues that certain forms of practical deference undermine autonomy not by compromising authenticity or reason-tracking, but by constituting a specific social relation of interpersonal rule. When an agent systematically defers to another's practical judgment, they establish a relationship where the other person partially governs their life. This form of deference entails a partial disconnection from the good of a self-authored life, even when the deferring agent reflectively endorses the arrangement.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the moral status of letting others make decisions for you, which is central to DIY ethics. Garnett's analysis suggests that systematic delegation of practical judgment (not just action) to others constitutes a form of heteronomy. The question for DIY ethics is whether hiring someone to perform a task involves the kind of practical deference Garnett identifies, or whether one can maintain autonomous control over one's life plan while outsourcing execution to others.

  title = {Taking the Measure of Autonomy: A Four-Dimensional Theory of Self-Governance},
  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315204932},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Killmister develops a multidimensional theory that distinguishes four distinct components of autonomy: self-definition (identifying with certain desires/values), self-realization (acting on those values), self-unification (coherence across time), and self-constitution (developing one's capacity for autonomy). She argues that previous theories err by treating autonomy as a single unified capacity when it actually involves multiple distinct but interrelated dimensions. Autonomy can be present in some dimensions while absent in others.

  RELEVANCE: Killmister's multidimensional framework is directly relevant to DIY ethics because it allows us to ask whether delegation affects different dimensions of autonomy differently. Perhaps outsourcing tasks compromises self-realization (acting on one's values through one's own efforts) without affecting self-definition (identifying with the goal of getting the task done). The framework provides conceptual tools for a nuanced analysis of how different forms of delegation affect autonomy.

  POSITION: Multidimensional account—autonomy consists of multiple distinct components that can vary independently.

  abstract = {This ambitious book cuts against the grain. Killmister lays out a framework for thinking about autonomy that eschews the received view in many quarters. Difficulty reconciling the various uses to which "autonomy" is put has led to calls for a moratorium on our use of the term. Killmister demurs. Good for her. Her view centers on the idea that there are several dimensions to autonomy, and while they are related, one may fall short in one but not the others. The result is a nuanced theory of autonomy that illuminates how the concept applies in a range of domains and to a range of agents.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Killmister puts a wealth of cases to good use. This is especially helpful given that she begins with a barrage of distinctions, and the pace keeps up for some time. (By my count, we get 15 distinctions by the bottom of page 7!) It would've been nice for this reader to have a sense of what is at stake, aside from the fact that, despite it not being "a term we often hear in everyday conversation," autonomy names something "people are already implicitly tracking" (1). Sure enough, we do recoil from paternalist interventions in our lives and judge each other in "autonomy-related" ways. This helps to explain why we want a theory that yields the correct verdicts in a range of cases and illuminates connections with closely related concepts. If we didn't think autonomy mattered, there'd be no need for such a fuss.

And yet, so far as I see, Killmister simply assumes that we are right about this. She doesn't elaborate on autonomy's importance to us or argue that we are correct to care about it. This is a shame. Interrogating the notion that autonomy matters can help to shed light on how we should think about the concept. This is a point I'll return to. But first I want to say something about Killmister's four-dimensional theory and its virtues.

Though I have complained about the number of distinctions and the speed with which they come at you, at the end of the day, they pay off. Killmister analyzes autonomy along four interrelated, yet distinct dimensions. The first three flesh out the 'self' of self-governance and concern what she labelslocalautonomy. The first,self-definition, concerns the various attitudes that bring with them "agential commitments." Given that one valuesxor believesyor haszas a goal, there is something that one ought to do or be. These attitudes provide normative standards; one's values, beliefs, and goals may be more or less coherent. And the more coherent one's self-defining attitudes, the more autonomous one is along this first dimension.

While self-definition is about the agent's identity, the second dimension,self-realisation,is about her agency. It concerns the commitments one takes on in virtue of deliberating in the service of forming intentions (internal self-realisation), as well as the commitments one takes on in virtue of intending in the service of acting (external self-realisation). Killmister helpfully points out that there are various ways of falling short of the standards set by these commitments -- for example, one might akratically intend what one recognizes as the worse option or fail to do as one intends due to a false belief.

The third dimension of autonomy,self-unification, has to do with integrating the previous two. Do one's intentions and actions uphold the commitments that stem from one's beliefs, values, and goals? Does one alter one's identity in the ways one intends to? Here, Killmister's is a no-priority view: one can autonomously resolve cases of conflict -- for example, intending to do something that goes against one's values -- either by altering the intention or altering the values. I'm not convinced. This aspect of the view appears to rely on a conception of intentions on which they may be authoritatively formed independently of the agent's values. I don't think that's correct. But it's noteworthy because it's emblematic of a general tendency in Killmister's thought. She focuses on the structure of autonomy, not its substance. And so she avoids taking a stand on issues regarding how exactly to fill in the framework she so carefully lays out. Shortly, I'll say a bit more about why I think this general tendency is mistaken.

The fourth dimension,self-constitution, concerns "the extent to which an agent is in the business of taking on commitments" as opposed to upholding them (69). This dimension capturesglobalautonomy and sets a minimum threshold for being autonomous -- that is, for being the kind of agent for whom paternalism, consent, moral responsibility, and distinctive forms of respect are an issue. There are three requirements: (1) the agent must have some values, beliefs, or goals; (2) the agent must be willing and able to seriously deliberate and act; and (3) the agent must be able to unify her attitudes and exercises of agency. Interestingly, Killmister argues that one can fall short of one of these requirements while satisfying the others. Thus, meeting the minimum threshold is not a simple all-or-nothing affair. Moreover, this dimension admits of degrees and localized failures. Someone whose self-defining attitudes are wider in scope is more autonomous along the dimension of self-constitution than one whose self-defining attitudes are narrower in scope, and bouts of severe pain may temporarily disrupt one's willingness to deliberate, rendering one less globally autonomous for some time. These added nuances are welcome.

And they are not confined to the fourth dimension of autonomy alone. One of the main attractions of Killmister's view is that it allows for nuanced analysis of a wide range of cases. For example, her view yields the interesting conclusion that the "contented slave" and "deferential wife" are both highly locally autonomous, and yet they suffer from a deficit of global autonomy. Thus, her view is able to illuminate the "double bind" hemming such agents in: they can only increase their global autonomy at the expense of reducing their local autonomy, and vice versa. The view also yields interesting insights about the ways in which oppression diminishes autonomy and the ways in which interventions may serve to enhance it. Here Killmister should be applauded for attending to questions about the autonomy of disabled persons, who often don't get the attention they deserve.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Mackenzie provides an authoritative overview of relational autonomy theories, distinguishing internalist from externalist and procedural from substantive approaches. She proposes a multidimensional analysis that distinguishes self-determination (capacities for practical reasoning), self-governance (higher-order reflection), and self-authorization (taking up agentic authority) as distinct dimensions. Crucially, she argues that social oppression can impair autonomy in multiple ways by affecting these different dimensions through different mechanisms.

  RELEVANCE: Mackenzie's framework is essential for understanding debates about whether autonomy requires independence or can be compatible with dependence and delegation. Her distinction between self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization helps clarify whether DIY activities are valuable because they are necessary for one dimension of autonomy (perhaps self-realization or self-authorization) even if they are not necessary for other dimensions. The paper also addresses how social relationships enable rather than undermine autonomy.

It proposes that a multidimensional analysis of autonomy offers a possible resolution to these debates. Specifically, the chapter argues for the importance of distinguishing self-determination, self-governance, and self-authorization as distinct although causally interacting dimensions of relational autonomy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: The authors argue that the individualistic understanding of autonomy dominant in clinical practice and research is inadequate because it treats people as independent, self-interested, rational decision-makers. They propose that relational autonomy—which recognizes that identities, needs, and interests are shaped by relationships—can provide practical solutions to ethical problems in clinical settings. They examine four case studies showing how relational autonomy can facilitate consideration of care and responsibility for connected others while preserving ultimate decisional authority.

  RELEVANCE: This paper shows how relational autonomy can be operationalized in practice, not just theorized abstractly. For DIY ethics, it suggests that autonomous decisions about whether to do things oneself or delegate may legitimately be influenced by consideration of relationships and responsibilities to others. The paper challenges the assumption that autonomous choice must be made by an isolated individual considering only their own interests.

  abstract = {The dominant, individualistic understanding of autonomy that features in clinical practice and research is underpinned by the idea that people are, in their ideal form, independent, self-interested and rational gain-maximising decision-makers. In recent decades, this paradigm has been challenged from various disciplinary and intellectual directions. Proponents of ‘relational autonomy’ in particular have argued that people’s identities, needs, interests – and indeed autonomy – are always also shaped by their relations to others. Yet, despite the pronounced and nuanced critique directed at an individualistic understanding of autonomy, this critique has had very little effect on ethical and legal instruments in clinical practice and research so far. In this article, we use four case studies to explore to what extent, if at all, relational autonomy can provide solutions to ethical and practical problems in clinical practice and research. We conclude that certain forms of relational autonomy can have a tangible and positive impact on clinical practice and research. These solutions leave the ultimate decision to the person most affected, but encourage and facilitate the consideration of this person’s care and responsibility for connected others.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume established relational autonomy as a major research program in philosophy. The contributors argue that traditional accounts of autonomy that emphasize independence, self-sufficiency, and rational self-interest are inadequate because they ignore the social dimensions of selfhood and agency. Autonomy should be understood as a capacity that develops through and is exercised within social relationships, and oppressive social conditions can undermine autonomy even when agents reflectively endorse their choices. The volume includes both causal and constitutive relational theories.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational text is essential for understanding the relational autonomy tradition that challenges individualistic assumptions. For DIY ethics, it raises the question of whether the value of doing things oneself stems from an individualistic ideal of self-sufficiency that relational theorists would reject. Alternatively, relational autonomy might support DIY activities as ways of developing autonomous capacities through engagement with others and the world.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Westlund defends a constitutively relational account of autonomy against Christman's charge that such accounts are problematically perfectionist. She argues that autonomy is dialogical—it requires accountability to others in the sense that autonomous agents must be prepared to answer for themselves and their commitments. This dialogical structure is constitutive of autonomy rather than an external condition. However, this does not entail perfectionism about the good life because the dialogical condition is formal and content-neutral.

  RELEVANCE: Westlund's dialogical account suggests that autonomy requires responsiveness to others' perspectives and potential challenges, which complicates the DIY question. If autonomy is inherently dialogical, then completely independent action might actually be less autonomous than action coordinated with others. The paper helps clarify whether DIY activities are valuable because they enhance dialogical accountability or whether delegation can preserve such accountability.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Khader argues that socially constitutive conceptions of relational autonomy that make idealized social conditions necessary for autonomy are problematic for feminism. When applied under nonideal conditions, such conceptions cannot play two key feminist roles: serving as an anti-oppressive character ideal and limiting paternalism. Socially constitutive autonomy asks oppressed agents to engage in self-harm or self-subordination, and it implies that oppressed agents are appropriate targets of paternalism because they lack autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Khader's critique challenges relational autonomy theories and defends a more individualistic conception. For DIY ethics, her argument suggests caution about grounding the value of doing things oneself in relational autonomy—such grounding might imply that people in non-ideal social conditions who lack enabling relationships lack autonomy and should be subject to paternalistic intervention.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bratman develops a planning theory account of autonomy that grounds self-governance in the agent's temporally extended planning agency. Autonomous desire and action require satisfaction of planning-theoretic demands for consistency, coherence, and stability in the agent's hierarchical system of plans and policies. Self-governing policies play a central coordinating role in the agent's life over time. Autonomy is a matter of the functioning of this planning system rather than mere reflective endorsement at a moment.

  RELEVANCE: Bratman's account extends Frankfurt's hierarchical model with emphasis on temporal extension and planning. For DIY ethics, the question is whether engaging in an activity oneself or delegating it affects the coherence and stability of one's planning system. Perhaps autonomous agents need to maintain certain higher-order policies about which domains of their life they will govern directly versus delegate, and DIY activities might be those that fall under policies of direct governance.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Benson argues that free agency requires not just internal coherence of desires (as in Frankfurt's account) but also that the agent regard herself as competent to answer for her actions in the normative sense. Autonomy requires a sense of self-worth—specifically, the conviction that one's evaluative judgments are worthy of respect. Oppression can undermine autonomy by damaging an agent's sense of self-worth even when their desires are internally coherent.

  RELEVANCE: Benson's emphasis on self-worth and normative competence suggests a connection between autonomy and the development of competencies through practice. DIY activities might be valuable because engaging in them oneself develops and maintains the sense of competence that Benson identifies as necessary for autonomy. Systematically delegating tasks to others might erode this sense of normative competence over time.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fischer and Ravizza develop a reasons-responsive theory of moral responsibility where an agent is responsible for an action when it issues from their own, moderately reasons-responsive mechanism. They distinguish guidance control (necessary for responsibility) from regulative control (requiring alternative possibilities). An agent has guidance control when they act from a mechanism that is responsive to reasons in an appropriate way, including recognition of sufficient reasons to act otherwise.

  RELEVANCE: The reasons-responsive framework provides an alternative to hierarchical theories for thinking about autonomy and control. For DIY ethics, the question is whether delegating a task to another person means the action no longer issues from the agent's own reasons-responsive mechanism. If autonomous action requires that it flow from the agent's own capacity to respond to reasons, then having another person execute the action might compromise autonomy even if the agent maintains control over outcomes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Oshana argues for an externalist, socially constituted account of autonomy where external social conditions are not merely enabling conditions but constitutive of autonomy itself. Personal autonomy requires both internal psychological conditions and external political conditions of non-domination and self-governance. Social structures and relationships can determine whether an agent is autonomous regardless of the agent's internal psychological states or reflective endorsement.

  RELEVANCE: Oshana's strongly externalist account raises questions about whether autonomy can be achieved through purely individual action or whether it necessarily involves participation in social structures. For DIY ethics, her view might suggest that the value of doing things oneself depends heavily on the social context—DIY activities might promote autonomy by establishing relationships of independence and non-domination, but delegation need not undermine autonomy if it occurs within egalitarian social relationships.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Christman defends a procedural account of autonomy against externalist relational theories. He argues that autonomy requires certain internal conditions (non-alienation from the factors that led to one's values) but does not require external social conditions to be ideal or even good. While acknowledging that selves are socially constituted, Christman maintains that autonomy is compatible with flawed social conditions as long as the agent does not feel alienated from the process of self-development when authentically reflecting on it.

  RELEVANCE: Christman's procedural internalist account provides a middle ground between strongly individualistic and strongly relational accounts. For DIY ethics, his view suggests that what matters is whether the agent identifies with the decision to do something oneself versus delegate, not whether one approach is inherently more autonomous. The value of DIY might be not that it is necessary for autonomy but that it satisfies certain agents' authentic values about how to live.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Stoljar develops a substantive account of relational autonomy that includes a normative competence condition. She argues that purely procedural accounts fail to capture the feminist intuition that agents whose preferences are shaped by oppressive socialization lack autonomy. Autonomy requires not just reflection on one's desires but also that one's capacity for normative reflection not be damaged by oppressive norms. Substantive conditions on autonomy are necessary to identify when socialization undermines autonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Stoljar's substantive account raises questions about whether social norms that valorize either DIY activities or delegation might affect autonomy. If preferences for doing things oneself are shaped by oppressive norms of self-reliance that prevent people from accepting help, those preferences might be non-autonomous. Conversely, if preferences for delegation are shaped by norms that denigrate manual labor or practical skills, those preferences might also be non-autonomous.

  POSITION: Substantive relational autonomy—autonomy requires normative competence not damaged by oppression.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper reconstructs Van Parijs’ core argument for an unconditional basic income and presents three objections against it. The first and most theoretical objection attacks the egalitarian basis of Van Parijs’ argument and suggests an alternative, humanitarian theory of justice. The second and third more concrete objections accuse Van Parijs of selling-out the right to work as well as the right to recognition of work, for example of family work. The conclusion drawn from these three objections, however, is not that an unconditional basic income cannot be defended. Instead the paper ends by indicating an alternative, humanitarian argument for an unconditional basic income.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Anderson critiques purely coherentist theories of autonomy (like Frankfurt's) that ground autonomy in internal coherence of desires. He argues that autonomy requires social normativity—the authority of personal commitments derives from interpersonal recognition and acknowledgment. Autonomous agents must have their commitments recognized as authoritative by others. This social dimension is not just an enabling condition but constitutive of the authority that autonomous commitments have.

  RELEVANCE: Anderson's emphasis on social recognition complicates the DIY question by suggesting that autonomous action might require that one's choices be recognizable to others as expressions of commitment. If DIY activities are valued because they make one's commitments publicly legible in a way that delegation does not, this would support the intrinsic value of doing things oneself. However, it might also mean that in communities where delegation is the norm, DIY activities could undermine autonomy by appearing eccentric or unintelligible.

  POSITION: Social normativity account—autonomy requires interpersonal recognition of commitments.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kawall develops an account of epistemic autonomy as a wide-ranging epistemic virtue that helps understand phenomena from method selection to epistemic oppression. Drawing on elements common to personal autonomy accounts (self-governance, authenticity, self-creation, independence), he argues that epistemic autonomy involves appropriately choosing subject matters, methods, sources, epistemic goals, and epistemic stances. Epistemic autonomy shapes most aspects of our epistemic lives and must ultimately reliably lead to valuable epistemic goods.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on epistemic rather than practical autonomy, Kawall's framework suggests that autonomy in any domain involves appropriate selection of methods and goals. For DIY ethics, this raises the question of whether practical autonomy similarly requires that agents have control over the methods they use to achieve their goals, not just the goals themselves. If practical autonomy involves choosing one's methods of action, this might support the value of DIY activities over delegation.

  POSITION: Epistemic autonomy—domain-specific autonomy involves control over methods and frameworks.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT I present an account of epistemic autonomy as a distinctively wide-ranging epistemic virtue, one that helps us to understand a range of phenomena that might otherwise seem quite disparate – from the appropriate selection of epistemic methods, stances and topics of inquiry, to the harms of epistemic oppression, gaslighting and related phenomena. The account draws on four elements commonly incorporated into accounts of personal autonomy: (i) self-governance, (ii) authenticity, (iii) self-creation and (iv) independence. I further argue that for a distinctively epistemic virtue of autonomy; the above elements must ultimately reliably lead to valuable epistemic goods (for the agent herself and others). I then turn to the domains or ways in which epistemic autonomy so understood, can be made manifest. I suggest that epistemic autonomy is a virtue that allows us to appropriately choose (i) subject matters and areas of inquiry, (ii) methods, sources, and processes of belief formation, (iii) epistemic goals and (iv) epistemic stances or frameworks. So understood, epistemic autonomy has a role to play in shaping most every aspect of our epistemic lives.},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mhlambi and Tiribelli argue that mainstream AI ethics frameworks center a liberal notion of autonomy as rational self-determination that fails to address harms particularly affecting marginalized populations. They propose a relational turn in AI ethics drawing on relational autonomy theories and Ubuntu ethics, emphasizing interdependence and collective well-being. The relational approach better captures how AI systems can violate autonomy through effects on relationships and social structures, not just individual decision-making.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends relational autonomy to the context of AI and technological systems. For DIY ethics in the age of AI assistants and automation, it raises questions about whether using AI tools constitutes a form of delegation that affects relational autonomy differently than delegation to human agents. The paper suggests that autonomy in technological contexts cannot be understood purely individualistically but must consider how tools mediate relationships and social structures.

  POSITION: Relational autonomy applied to AI ethics—technology affects autonomy through social relationships.

  abstract = {Many popular artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks center the principle of autonomy as necessary in order to mitigate the harms that might result from the use of AI within society. These harms often disproportionately affect the most marginalized within society. In this paper, we argue that the principle of autonomy, as currently formalized in AI ethics, is itself flawed, as it expresses only a mainstream mainly liberal notion of autonomy as rational self-determination, derived from Western traditional philosophy. In particular, we claim that the adherence to such principle, as currently formalized, does not only fail to address many ways in which people’s autonomy can be violated, but also to grasp a broader range of AI-empowered harms profoundly tied to the legacy of colonization, and which particularly affect the already marginalized and most vulnerable on a global scale. To counter such a phenomenon, we advocate for the need of a relational turn in AI ethics, starting from a relational rethinking of the AI ethics principle of autonomy that we propose by drawing on theories on relational autonomy developed both in moral philosophy and Ubuntu ethics.},

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190087647.003.0002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Swaine elaborates a conception of personal autonomy as individual self-rule, understood as consistent with but distinct from self-governance or living under one's own laws. He distinguishes personal autonomy from individual freedom and from absence of social control. The chapter describes grounds for valuing personal autonomy including its connection to dignity, responsibility, and the meaningfulness of life. Personal autonomy as self-rule is not heavily moralized and can be impaired by various internal and external factors.

  RELEVANCE: Swaine's conceptual clarification of autonomy as self-rule rather than self-governance or freedom helps distinguish different aspects of autonomous agency relevant to DIY ethics. If autonomy is fundamentally about ruling oneself, the question is whether delegating tasks means one ceases to rule that domain of one's life or whether one can rule through delegation. The distinction between autonomy and freedom is also relevant—perhaps DIY activities are valuable for freedom without being necessary for autonomy.

  POSITION: Conceptual analysis—autonomy as self-rule distinguished from related concepts.

Autonomy as self-rule is preferable to alternative conceptualizations such as autonomy as self-governance or autonomy as living under one’s own laws. Personal autonomy is different from individual freedom, and it is not identical to the absence of social control. There are several notable grounds for valuing personal autonomy; this chapter describes them, giving a fuller sense of the significance and attractiveness of autonomy of the personal kind.},
